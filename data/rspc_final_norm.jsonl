There wasn't any infidelity nor any conflict. We have been dating for 5 years and was planning to get married late this year. However, recently, I have been feeling that he was not putting effort into having dates like we used to.\n\nHe's living in Finland and its been pretty sunny these days. I understand that they like to be out and enjoy sports under the sun. However, it's been really different these days. I have been waiting for him and communicated to him that we haven't had a good date recently because he's always out with friends, do sports, and even in their cabin. We call every day when he goes to work or when he goes home. I think it was more of like the quality of the time spent aside from the quantity of it.\n\nI have started asking myself if im just being sensitive or im just being needy but it hasn't been like that lately. It's just that during the times when I felt so low and I needed my fiance, he was busy playing disc golf and that struck me lately. I felt really lonely in the relationship even especially that we are preparing to get married soon. For context, we are 6 hrs+ from his timezone, and I am working midshift so our time wouldn't be so conflicted.\n\nI have also communicated this to him, he even promised to spend more time with me, but he would just be good for one week then the next,  he's back to his old self already. I have not talked to him since last night because I am really just upset. I am giving myself a break and some space from the relationship but I am really on the verge of making it final and just break up with him.

I'll spare the details but we really did love each other a whole lot and were thinking of visiting each other before the year was out.\n\nShe had a very unstable home life and generally had a very bleak outlook on life. Her roommate told me I was one of a few things that seemed to make her really happy. I was the first person she contacted when she was last in hospital for a previous attempt - after that we realised we liked each other more than we thought.\n\nAfter getting a new job a couple of weeks ago, her roommate offered to let her stay over until she found her own place. A few days ago she had a falling out with them and ran off. I could tell from her messages that something wasn't right and managed to clock that she was probably going to kill herself. What followed were the two most stressful hours of my life. I begged and plead for her to stick around. Eventually she seemed to calm down and said she would be okay but I haven't heard from her since.\n\nI don't know if she's dead, in hospital, or something else. Her roommate hasn't heard anything from her. I contacted a close friend of hers but she hasn't heard anything either, and her phone is going straight to voicemail.\nShort of contacting her parents (who she didn't have a great relationship with) just in case they've heard anything, I have no idea what to do. I'm struggling to focus on anything and spend most of my day in bed, sleeping about 4 hours each day, barely eating, and praying that I'll hear something from her.

Apologies for the long read.We met on reddit (don't do it) about nine months ago. We live several states apart. Started off as breakup buddies, nothing serious, and both stopped talking for about a month (she dated someone else in the meantime lol). I came back healed, with a realization that I had an interest in her. We hesitantly started being involved romantically. She was upfront about still being unhealed from her long previous relationship, but still wanted to continue if I did. She was also upfront about being in a situation where she banged one of her male friends after her breakup and received fallout for it during her short dating cycle. I really didn't care about this at the time, and still really don't (more to come)\n\nShe's very into astrology, and kept making jokes that Pluto has these \"transits\" that claim she'll have a brief romance up until September of this year, then some short flings and finally a long term relationship or something. She seemed deathly serious about this so I was a little bit peeved like okay is that your intention here, to fulfill your prophecy? You know you control your life?\n\nWe moved on, continued to date, she flew out to see me twice and had good times but we also both had very poor communication at times. If something bothered me, I would compartmentalize and work through it myself. On the second trip, about six months of knowing each other, I told her I loved her. She didn't recriprocate and this made things awkward. She left and I realized that it wasn't necessary for her to share those feelings verbally, as she was showing them with actions. We were good.\n\nDuring this entire time period, she was not easy to date. I still love her dearly, and she has a lot of lovely traits, gave me attention, and was trustworthy, but she constantly brought up her ex, didn't accept compliments well, and shut down most long term discussion regularly. She would regularly overreact to small situations and get upset for days. She was aware of this and on multiple occasions attempted to end things because she was \"undeserving and I deserved more.\" She wanted to be alone to heal (lol). She's also had issues with her pets that caused a lot of turmoil from them getting and sick and even her cat dying.\n\nMoving on to this month, so she's still friends with her friend that she casually banged because he was \"doing her a solid\" by initiating an offer to have sex with her when she had gone without it for so long, and it didn't have to mean anything. I told her this guy was obviously lurking in the shadows waiting for this opportunity and she went ballistic. She also has another ex from several years prior who moved to her city in the last few months and she was trying to befriend him because he had no friends (sincerely innocent on her part), and then she went to another exes wedding this month (and was in the wedding party), and apparently they're best friends now. She was upfront about about all of this, and I genuinely did trust her but I told her all of this compounding was making me uncomfortable. I told her this was not a normal situation and that I accept her friendships, but I'm never going to rejoice at the fact. I'm never going to celebrate these relationships, and wasn't even asking for anything, I just wanted to share how I was feeling. She lost it and this was the last straw. She was once again being \"slut shamed\" and I was dishonest, etc. She shared that she was an awful partner and couldn't respond like a normal person would to situations like this and wanted to breakup to be alone. Again, I deserved better.\n\nI also really believe she's playing into that September stuff which could indicate some type of very real psychological discrepancies. Don't get me wrong, I love diagnosing my Pisces traits and matching my personality, but to let a planet control my love life is too much.\n\nIt's difficult because she cares, and is just not ready for this. She's really a great human being who's been dealt some very shitty hands. I don't think she truly realizes what she's lost and she may never. I was not perfect, and lacked communication at times, but I feel like I was not wrong at the end, and will remain course. I'm not in the business of chasing someone who doesn't want me. I guess maybe I'm just asking for some solace? Please help.\n\nTldr: long distance girlfriend broke up because I was uncomfortable with her being friends with multiple exes.

Sometimes even one small word from her can ruin my whole day because I’m so sensitive.

Then he moved back to my city for work. We kinda started dating but it was always not so serious. In my life I always had some abroad plans so when we started dating, we thought that we only start this because we can’t control our emotions and can’t keep being friends only and at some point of my life i might go to a very far country that he might not able to come (but my initial abroad plan was cancelled because i didn’t got a scholarship that i need so we dated in the same city for years). \n\nAfter a year of dating, i started to be the person in the relationship that requests more attention (after the honeymoon phase ended). Somehow we managed to still stay in a relationship for 3 years even though we broke up for short whiles due to some fights related to us not fit each other that much or him not giving me girlfriend attention (only giving wholesome friend type of attention). \n\nLast year I moved in a different city for studies but i was visiting once in 3 weeks so we didn’t have a long period that we didn’t see each other. And he visited my city once (me coming to his place was much easier and economic than him coming to my city as i don’t have anywhere to host him) \n\n\nThis year I moved to a different country temporarily for 6 months. In 2 weeks ill go back to my country actually. In these 6 months we never met as i didn’t go back to my country and he didn’t come to the country i live now (he didn’t put much effort to get a visa even tho we were talking about him coming and us traveling together) \nthe first 2 months I was trying to have online calls and dates so that we still have a bond. When I invited him to these he was joining and having fun. But later on, my life in this country got more and more busy and I didn’t invite him to anything online. He also didn’t do it so many weeks passed without having contact other than short texts. As time passed I also got more distant to him and valued my friends and life in this new country more so i wasn’t nagging him much about the lack of communication. At some point I mentioned him that we got more distant and he agreed. He told me that he doesn’t know why it happened and he was joking that (as if talking about a business plan) “well we need to take action about this issue” when i asked him how he feels about this. Usually he has a personality that doesn’t share his emotions and jokes to change the topic or the focus of the question. \nI was talking this with my therapist also and I was telling her how he doesn’t show me attention. My therapist told me that I need to openly tell him that I need attention so I did, I called him and we had a convo about attention and I asked him “I want this from a boyfriend, can you give me the attention I need?” and he said “I am not sure if I can give the amount of attention you want, my personality isn’t like that and if I fake it, you’ll understand and it will be not genuine” and we decided to think more about this and not decide anything now. \n\nRecently I had another session with my therapist and she told me that how I describe attention might be different from someone else as it can be a vague term. So she wanted me to describe it. This made sense for me and I asked the same thing to him on text. I told him “my therapist mentioned this and that blablabla so, how do you describe attention?” \nhe responded me like “how i describe attention?” “I think we both know what attention means and we dont need to have this conversation” I just sent sad emoji face to that and he said “ I dont know its just we dont have anything to talk about and i find it difficult to do small talk and show attention, its like we’re very distant” and then i told that “okay nevermind i just asked because we talked this with my doctor so i wanted to ask you before i forget” \nand then he said “im sorry, are you okay?” and i said i am okay. so that was our last texts and i dont think we’re gonna talk much later \n\n\nthe thing is as he is a close friend and a boyfriend for such a long time i feel like he was the right person for me and he was sweet when we were not long distance. So im not sure if we live in the same city and get along well everything will be okay? or should i see this as a sign that he is not really into me anymore? what does it tell about a person that is mostly a good boyfriend when you are together but doesn’t do much to keep the spark alive when you are apart?\n\ntl;dr: We are an OKAY couple when we are in the same city but during long distance he stopped giving attention. Is this normal or is this a red flag? He is a genuinely good person btw", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Kinda starting from the beginning so hopefully people understand my pov. \n\nI(23F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for nearly a year and we are long distance. He’s here in the US from Denmark on a scholarship for a school in west va and I live in va. I don’t know if I’m overthinking things, and I’m looking for some advice. We met off of tinder. Our relationship progressed pretty quickly and within 2-3 weeks I asked for us to be exclusive and he agreed and we made it official. My last relationship was 4 years and even got engaged. It was my first serious relationship and it was horrible, non stop arguments, always being mistreated, manipulated, and controlled. I was naive and thought it was normal to go through\n\nMy current boyfriend treats me better than I could have ever asked for or imagined. He doesn’t kiss the ground I walk on, but that isn’t something I want. I want an equal, not someone with an obsession. He’s done a lot for me without even realizing it and I have really come to love him. Not the ideas of him but his actions. He isn’t a super expressive person but I know he does his best for me. Hes been a gentle kind of love and I treasure it. I’m not even sure that I want kids or even marriage. But a small part of me wants that with him even though I don’t necessarily want it for myself. \n\nNow, onto what I’m unsure of.\n\nI know most of my feelings and wants and where I see this relationship possibly heading. I don’t know his. I’m trying to get into university in Denmark to get a business degree. He’s getting his in computer science. I would want us to maybe live together, maybe get another dog. Go on trips, and be with each other in a simple way. He hasn’t thought farther than his next football game coming up as far as I know. He doesn’t know whether he’s going to get a full time job or pursue football (his scholarship) he doesn’t know if he wants kids or marriage (no hate there since I’m on the same boat) like I have these wants for what a future with him can be and what I’d be willing to do to make it happen. And i don’t think he thinks like that. So I stress about knowing exactly how he feels. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago when I was visiting him at the school in West VA. I saw he had updated his tinder account. Little back story with this. We met on tinder, we both uninstalled but never deleted our accounts. I reinstalled it that day to see what day we started talking because I was randomly curious. His account pictures were changed and so was his bio. Wasn’t any big change. Just a video of him and his friend together and he’s in a frat so he had their name put in his bio. He was out for practice when I found it, when he got back I asked him if he could please sit down. I showed him what I found and he had no real explanation. I asked him why, he said he doesn’t know why he did it and he made a mistake. Of course there were more things said and asked but I’m going off of what I can generally remember. I asked him if I could go through his phone and I went through it all right in front of him. He had no messages or anything but old ones from before me on tinder, no hinge or any other dating apps. Nothing on messenger with his (girl) friends or friends back in Denmark , he speaks danish and I’m learning so I google translated portions. I went through his texts, calls, and photos. Even made sure to check the recently deleted. I went through all of it and I hated it. That I was having to invade his privacy because he affected my trust in him.  But, I found nothing that showed he actually cheated. \n\nI got really frustrated, all my unanswered questions and doubts came out one after another. I told him “I’ve made it clear how I feel and where I see this relationship heading in the future and what I want with you and you haven’t, I need to know. Are you serious about this? I’m not playing games and “seeing where this takes me” I know that I love you and I want to be with you. Make it clear to me, we’re both adults, stop pussy footing around it” and he did he said that he wants me and loves me. That I’ve made him happier, he said he was serious. I told him to come forward with anything and now was his one and only chance. He said he never cheated. He hugged me and apologized, he said he knew he was an asshole. That there were the times when we hadn’t seen eachother for 2-3 months and he wanted physical sex but he never went out and got it and he was faithful. He fully owned up to making a mistake. I mean it felt and seemed genuine, unless hes the best actor. He didn’t cry or beg for forgiveness or apologize profusely like a little wimp. He owned up, he apologized, and he answered any questions I had. We talked about it the night of and we talked more the next day once I really thought about things. We’ve been perfect, and honestly better since then.\n\nOn a side note, we’ve never really argued or had issues within our relationship. We’ve always communicated effectively. Even with this situation it was handled well.\n\nBut on my end I’m kind of having an internal battle of wondering if I love this man more than he will ever love me. Or if he’s just truly not expressive and doesn’t know how to show his feelings. And if I’m letting my feelings for him cover the fact that he kind of cheated🤷‍♀️\n\nFound out the night I confronted him that his (girl) friends back home in Denmark, he’s had sex with just about all of them in the past. And that he hung out and texts his last “situationship” back at home, they’ve been friends and have known eachother from school. There’s nothing sexual as far as I know. His messenger texts with his friends I translated, initially I didn’t read all of them. I feel horrible for this but he has a pc. And he’s logged into messenger off of it. So the next day after I confronted him, I thoroughly went through everything. Google translated the entire chat. And he still doesn’t know I have access when I visit.  \n\nThis is what really hurts. He said to his friend who we will call Natalie (who he’s also slept with). A month or so before coming back to the US (he came back in August, I found his tinder profile 2 weeks after) that he was getting “pretty fucking tired” of me calling, and it being the same time everyday and that it’s started to stress him out. He never communicated this to me. Beforehand we even talked about what times I’d call him because of the time difference since he was back in Denmark at the time. It wasn’t an official meeting of course more or so I’ll call you and this time and then you call me when you’re done with whatever.\n It was the same times on my end because I was working two jobs. One full and one part time after. I’d wake up and 5am (his 11am) and we’d talk before I head into work. Then I’d call him on my way to my second job at 5:30 pm and say goodnight and blah blah. He never told me he had a problem with it. \n\nThen I read on his messenger texts from when he was on tinder and there’s this girl who we will call Soup that he seemed interested in. He said he thought she was cute, tried to match with her, she didn’t, and hes liked all her insta stories but she doesn’t respond etc.\n\nWhen I initially confronted him about the tinder profile he reassured me in all the ways possible. He was genuine. He told me he was so sorry for hurting me, that when there’s distance things with our relationship are so different and he made a mistake. Blah blah blah. When I’ve visited I’ve checked his messages with that one friend to see if he’s mentioned anything else about me or other girls and there’s been nothing since.\n\nHe’s done a lot to show his love for me. I’ve gone back to Denmark with him twice now, met all his family and some of his friends. \n\nI do all I really can to show someone I love them. For me love isn’t like that books, but a big part is sacrifice and compromise. Such as i drive 5 hours every other weekend to see him because hes not able to come to me. Or i let him have the last bite of cheesecake even if I want it. Or i would be willing to take my wants and dreams across the ocean to make a life with you possible, even if it doesnt end up working out. Running into this is really hard for me to understand how to make this mistake and be sorry. I feel as though he’s sorry for getting caught and also genuinely regrets what he did and truly cares and loves me, but I’m fighting myself on it because the thought of cheating or wanting someone else never crossed my mind\n\nI need other peoples opinions. There’s no one else I can talk to about this. I don’t want to leave him because I do love him, and he truly does make me happy. He’s made me want to be better and push farther. He’s my equal for me, he would be it if there’s an it. What do I do? Do I interrogate him? Come forward that I went through his stuff and found more, that I know more than what he’s lead onto?

(Lets call him Muha)\n\nShe has told me that they both used to like each other and they both have flirted and been romantic, and used to say \"I love you\" and stuff like that to each other. But they never officially dated, they both were in a situation ship. But my girlfriend told Muha that we started dating so they stopped, but remained friends. Me and Muha have never talked to each other before, we don't know each other, but we know ABOUT each other. \n\nRecently, just a week ago, I talked to one of my girlfriends female friend (lets call her Nash), I've known Nash since I've known my girlfriend, we all are in a group chat. Nash, Muha, and my girlfriend used to be close friends in a separate group chat way back then. \n\nI texted her friend asking about Muha, because I wanted to know more about their past. And she told me how they used to flirt etc. And she showed me everything in their group chat, and I saw how my girlfriend still seems overly friendly with him and shows him a lot of care, like the same care she shows me, and sometimes it slightly seems like she has feelings for him because she has slightly babied him too. The group chat is still alive. \n\nI asked my girlfriend if I could talk to Muha and discuss some boundaries I want between you both. And she said yes. She made a group chat with me, Muha, and herself. Me and my girlfriend were waiting for him to come online and he was taking a while and then I had to go offline for some time.. when I cam back, I saw that Muha and my girlfriend were talking to each other and talking about random stuff, and there were 700+ messages in a span of 1 hour. And my girlfriend was talking to him really enthusiastically like hes a super close trusted female friend. He also acts like a female, his profile, PFP, texting style, everything. So that made me feel really weird and jealous.. \n\nI started talking to him for the first time respectfully, and I started talking about the first boundary I wanted, and he immediately started being rude, he switched his tone with me. He was making weird jokes and said stuff like \"You seem really serious lol\", \"I'm not gonna steal your girl bro\" and \"Have her, keep her bro\" and he got really mad for no reason and thought I was being rude to him (which I wasnt). \n\nSo I simply left the group chat and talked to my girlfriend about the boundaries, and asked her to forward my messages to Muha which she did, and he reacted with \"👍\" and didn't say anything.\n\nSo I need some advice, should I tell my girlfriend hes a red flag and disrespectful, and advise her to leave him? Or ask her in a serious way about the boundaries and ask her to let me see her account to make sure everything between her and Muha is right.

I've had a lot of situationships in the past, but I got out of a 3-year relationship earlier this year and I feel like I'm back to Level 1 of dating.\n\nAs I said in the title, I met this guy in July via OmegleMe. We connected instantly and talked for almost 3 hours that night. We then connected via Telegram, eventually moved to WhatsApp, and hasn't stopped since then. We'd talk everyday about all sorts of things — work, family, music, faith. I feel like I can share everything with him, and he said he feels the same. He doesn't connect to people right away, so he was surprised that he's opening up with me.\n\nWe started having regular movie nights almost every single day. I'm 6 hours ahead of him but my office follows his timezone so we end up calling after our work. After watching a movie, we'd hang around and talk about other things. The call would sometimes last up to 6 or 7 hours, and we both end up whispering sweet nothings to each other while in bed, saying how sweet each others' voices are and how we wish we're not so far apart.\n\nWe talked about our expectations early on. He said that even though he has developed feelings for me, he know he isn't ready for a relationship yet. I wasn't looking for a relationship too, but I guess the difference is that he's put a period on us, while I'm open for something that could develop in the future.\n\nAnd that happened. My feelings developed, and even though his feelings developed too, he didn't want to act on it.\n\nI tried ending things two weeks ago, but I couldn't. Last night, I did it with so much hesitation and tears. I cried while speaking to him, and he did too. He said he won't stop me because doing so would be so selfish.\n\nI miss him so much. I was in a meeting earlier and had to turn my camera off as I couldn't stop crying. I badly want to reach out, but I don't think I should. I've been anxious for weeks due to a lot of reasons, but I feel like the situationship was contributing to it, too. I'm trying to clear the other things now and taking medications to lower my cortisol levels and have a clearer mind.\n\nOnce I have more clarity and my feelings subside, I'm thinking we could continue talking just as friends and implement stricter boundaries in the relationship, but the rational part of myself things this idea is foolish and I'd end up crying again if I do it. But for some reason, I feel like there's more to this connection, that I'm not done with it and him yet. Not necessarily in a romantic context, but maybe with a different purpose? But of course, this could just be my emotions running high.\n\nI usually had no issues leaving a situation I am done with.

I last visited in the winter (March) and I'm trying to hit all the seasons to know a little bit what the climate is like before I move there. I asked for the time off and it was rejected today. So obviously I can't go visit him, and he won't come visit me. \n\nI told him my concerns that my inability to visit would push our timeline back and he doesn't seem to understand? He's of the opinion that only spending 4 weeks in person together should matter less than the two years we've been dating and the ten years we've been friends. And that the only thing stopping us right now is that I want to make sure I have a transferable job (because he only works part time and couldn't support us if I didn't find something fast) but I have other reservations I'm not sure how to articulate. I'm autistic with alexithymia and words aren't my strong suit. We've only spent 4 weeks in person together and even spending time together in person is totally different from living together. It feels like it would be a huge leap of faith to get married and close the gap. \n\nI asked him what he would want in place before closing the gap if our roles were reversed and he said a safety net, which he said I have - which consists of his friends and family, a way to support himself in case I died in an accident, which he says I also have because I'm the one with the career, and whether we align on intimacy. We don't know the last one, because the last time I visited he was too anxious for us to try anything. I agree with him that those are all important things, but I feel like there's more that needs to be put in place. I'm just unsure what it is.\n\nAm I looking at this all wrong? I'm a little upset that he doesn't seem to understand how risky this is because the \"safety net\" he insists I have is all *his* family and friends. Which doesn't feel like a real safety net. Not if we have a breakup or something. From my point of view he's not making *any* sacrifices and wondering why I have reservations with making a bunch of big ones all at once with zero guarantee anything will work out.

So I met this girl back in January through some mutual friends while we were out at a bar. At the time, she had just ended a two-year relationship a couple of weeks earlier. We hit it off right away. What started as something casual-mostly meeting up when were out partying and going home together-quickly grew into something more serious. We started dating, and although we never officially called each other boyfriend and girlfriend, our connection felt just as close. \n\nFrom January to June we spent a lot of time together- by the end, we were practically seeing each other every day. When summer came, she moved back home, about seven hours away, since she had finished her studies in my hometown for good. During those months together, I made it clear I wanted a relationship. She admitted she was interested, but also said she wasn't ready, afraid of being hurt like she was in her last relationship.\n\nEven after she moved home, we stayed in touch, talking for hours every day for about a month. We even planned a holiday together. But when I saw her again after that month apart, things felt different. She seemed distant, and after a couple of days she told me she still wasn't ready for a relationship. Still saying she still was afraid to get hurt which was- to be honest a bit weird to me, seeing I had done nothing, but trying to prove her otherwise. She literally said to me that her and her girl-friends talk about how perfect I treated her and that every girl should have one of me. Later that summer, she moved to Barcelona for a year to study with two of her girl-friends, and said long-distance wasn't something she could commit to. She still hoped I would visit, but I told her I couldn't justify the cost-and honestly, I was also worried about how look to others. People had already commented that it was strange I went on a holiday with someone I wasn't officially with, so I couldn't help but think about how it would come across if I spent hundreds of euros to visit her abroad.\n\nLooking back, I realize that probably pushed her away even more. After our trip, she messaged me saying she wanted \"as little contact as possible\" while she was in Barcelona. Now, a month and a half later, I regret what I said. I think I let other people's opinions influence me instead of listening to what I really wanted.\n\nSo now I'm torn: should I reach out and tell her how I feel (and maybe ask if she is down to have me come visit her), or accept that it's a lost cause?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

It's been functioning well so far, however, since we are becoming more and more serious, we started thinking about closing the distance. \n\nThe main issue is that nobody wants to move, we both have good reasons to stay, both objective and subjective. My reasoning is that she will find a job much easier here, than me there, since I'm a teacher and in my country it's very difficult to find a steady teaching job, I can't work as a substitute all the time and not knowing if someone will need me tomorrow.

We met at work in the US this past summer and hit it off immediately. Now I am in my first year of college in Connecticut while she is in her last year of college (high school) in Ireland.

She told me I don’t treat her well as I get shutdown after the fights and stuff. I said I am sorry and I understood that I made a really big mistake shutting down. She told me we cannot get married if we are going to fight like this and I am rethinking whether we shall move forward or not I told her I am here for only 4 weeks and let’s close this gap together. She didn’t seem much willing. I told her I am sorry and I will make this better I don’t want to lose her. \nI started making her my priority again but this time she was not interested.

Her “cousin” [21M] moved in after she said he was just visiting.\n\nMy girlfriend (18F) and I (23M) have been dating a little over a month. We’re in a long-distance relationship I live in Indiana, she lives in Missouri. We FaceTime almost every night.\n\nBackground:\nI’ve known her mom since I was about 14, and our families became close family friends. I only met her daughter (my girlfriend) this year, and that’s when we started dating.\n\nShe told me her cousin (21M) would be visiting, but the day he arrived, she said he was actually moving in with her and her mom. Before he arrived, she even encouraged me to come visit before he showed up. Since then, she and her cousin have been hanging out often playing Fortnite and watching movies together.\n\nHere’s what’s confusing: I don’t even know if he’s her real cousin. He calls her mom “aunt” the same way me and my siblings always did when our families hung out, so it makes me wonder if he’s just a long-time family friend like me.\n\nWhat happened last night:\nOn FaceTime I noticed a box of Seagram’s. She told me she wasn’t drinking because her stomach hurt and only her cousin would be drinking. — Later in the night, I woke up early and saw her muted. While muted, I saw her take a drink. — When I asked in the morning if she drank, she said no. — After pressing her, she admitted she lied, apologized, and said she didn’t know why — only that she was tired from being up late. — On top of that, I got two different reasons for why she muted: first, because she was being loud while gaming, then later, because she went to the bathroom.\n\nWhy I’m uneasy:\nEach thing on its own may not seem huge. But when you add it up — her cousin suddenly moving in, her pushing me to visit before he arrived, them hanging out a lot, the lie about drinking, and the conflicting stories about muting — my gut has been telling me something isn’t right.\n\nWhat I need advice on (from people who understand LDR struggles):\nHow do I bring this up calmly without it sounding like I’m accusing her? — What boundaries make sense in long-distance relationships (honesty about small things, not muting without explanation, being upfront about living situation changes)? — Should I bring this up over the phone before I see her Saturday, or wait until we’re face-to-face?\n\nTL;DR:\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend (18F) for just over a month (I’m 23M). She said her cousin (21M) was just visiting, but the day he came she said he was moving in. They hang out a lot. Last night she lied about drinking when I saw her drink on FaceTime, gave two reasons for muting, and only admitted to lying after I pressed her.

Secondly, I know that an hour apart isn’t really a LDR to most, but I (54m) can’t drive, and she (55f) a registered nurse, has WAY too much going on to be able to drive here. \n\nWe met on a dating site way back in June of 2020 and hit it off right away. A month after we started talking I sent a bouquet of flowers to her work where she got them upon arrival. After messaging me she said that nobody gave her flowers before. \nAfter messaging each other for a couple of months she drove here and we got to know each other even more. The second (date) was even better, and we considered ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend at that time. She was working at a senior physical rehabilitation center, where shifts were 16 hours long, five or six days a week. She hated the place, so there were times where she would drive straight here immediately afterward and stay the night. I should add that there was extreme drama at her home. One adult child living at home and is a total narcissist, so she was escaping from that. \nFrom time to time I would take an Uber or Lyft to go visit her. Sixty to eighty dollars to get there and the same amount to get back. \nNow, what has kept us from closing the gap has been her family. Both of her parents have had dementia, and it was getting worse for them. Sometimes she would have to leave here and go back home to take care of them. Her mother would occasionally get extremely emotional and reach out to my gf. Between work, her parents, and drama at home, the only escape was to me. \nShe was divorced from a narcissist, who verbally and mentally abused her a lot, for twenty five years. I applaud her for leaving him. \nFast forward to last year, her mother died a week after visiting me, and she took it HARD. She left my house June third and went to her parents house, where she found her mother in bad shape. Took her mom to the ER, but mom never recovered. I haven’t seen her in person since then. I did set up a Gofundme to help pay for everything. In September of last year she told me that she wanted to take a break from the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship as she wouldn’t be able to give me the attention that I deserve. So I backed up and let her do what she needed to. I told her that I love her and would be there in case she needed anything. Her dad is still alive and kicking, living in a senior home, with dementia worse than her mother’s was. \nI have been supporting her, complimenting her, messaging her, and occasionally video chatting. But it’s been less and less in this span of time since June third last year. I finally asked her what she thought about our future, and it took a day to respond. She said she’s not sure. She wants it to work, but isn’t sure if we’re as compatible as when we first met. I know that we are, but I find that we’ve grown apart because I let her take care of things there. She even went as far as to say that I can move on, but I’m not ready to do that. I mean, I’m not ready to date at all at this point.\nIn that time she has decided to sell her house and move into her mom and dad’s, take care of dad whenever possible, work, and basically paying less attention to me.\nAt this point I’m considering telling her that I’m letting her go. Telling her that I can’t sit here, waiting for responses from her, day in and day out. Also, telling her that if she wants to get back together with me, I will welcome her back with open arms.

We weren't the kind of couple who met frequently but we were still happy meeting once every 2/3 months. \n\nNow that both of us are working, naturally it's tough to manage schedule and find some common time. I've noticed she never initiates any conversation on when we should meet next. She is comfortable and satisfied with the fact that we talk on call on a daily basis. It looks like she's made peace knowing that we won't be able to live in the same city for the next year (or two) so the only time we can meet is when we're are in a very low stress period in our job (which is quite hard for me)\n\nI've brought this up with her earlier this year and she acknowledged that she has gotten too comfortable and will try and make more of an effort. But she hasn't made any changes. I keep on telling her that as well grow older, we won't find time but rather we'll have to make time. She agrees with me but I see no changes.\n\nI feel helpless. I really don't want to force her to make such choices. Has anyone gone through something similar?

He’s a wonderful person, and I do love him, but our relationship has had its ups and downs. We’ve had a few serious arguments—mostly around intimacy. I’m more conservative while he’s more open, and at times I wasn’t sure if we’d make it through. It’s taken a lot of work to reach where we are now, and though we’ve made progress, there’s still room to grow.\n\nSometimes I feel comfortable being intimate, sometimes I don’t. He often expresses his need for intimacy, and while he never pressures or forces me, I can see it affects our relationship when I’m not in the same space. I’ve struggled with standing firm on my boundaries, and I’ve told him that I want to be seen as his girlfriend, as a woman he loves—not just as someone to be intimate with.\nAfter a recent argument, he reassured me that our relationship is still safe. And though I admit I was harsh when I told him it felt like he missed me mostly because he was horny, I know he loves me very much—it just so happens that he has a high libido. He’s also shown his love and commitment to me and my family in ways that have nothing to do with intimacy, which proves to me how genuine he is.\n\nDespite these challenges, we love each other deeply and share a vision for our future. Even though we’re long distance, that hope for what we’re building together has kept me motivated to work through our differences. I believe that if we can reach a stable foundation, we could be very happy together in the long run—it just requires some adjustments from both sides.\n\nI’ve read that the first year of a relationship is often the hardest. So I wanted to ask for advice for those who can relate. What helped you get there? What changed that strengthened your relationship?\n\nI don’t think either of us is toxic for the other. We just have differences that can be difficult to sort out. I believe in this relationship and we truly want it to work.\n\nTL;DR: My partner and I have had a rocky start, mainly around intimacy due to our differences. He has a high libido while I’m more conservative, but he’s proven his love in many ways beyond intimacy.

For some context: we were both in first year university but I have decided to drop out and take a gap year due to some program issues. He is still in first year. Although it has only been a talking stage so far, he treats me perfectly and is extremely thoughtful. The only thing is that I’m from Toronto and he’s in nyc. In my opinion the distance isn’t a problem and I’m willing to do LD. Me and him have both agreed that we shouldn’t make things official until we meet eachother in person; so because of this I havent really found interest in anyone else because I only have eyes for him. Recently, he called me and confessed that he had made out with another girl. He apologized, knows he made a mistake and says it wont happen again, and when I asked why he kept telling me he fell into temptation and he didn’t think our situation was that serious (mind you, he had been telling me things like “you’re the only girl I see” and “all I need is you and God”). Of course I was extremely hurt and infidelity is something I take as a dealbreaker. But I find myself going back and forth in my mind because yea we weren’t officially together so it’s not as bad, plus he treated me perfectly. Since then he wrote me many apologies, even a letter expressing how he knows what he lost and what he did was wrong and he’d wait for me as long as I need to feel better and do it right this time but I’m just not sure if I can take that gamble.

I want to make things better and express to him how much he means to me but i don’t know how to. \n\nSo, to begin with, we are in LDR right now and we started LDR like two years ago. I cheated on him after 4 months of LDR. It will soon be a year after we reconnected. Before LDR we had this wonderful relationship that i ruined after doing it and i regret it every single day. Even when i was doing it with the other guy i was like a dead body just doing it because i did it the first time. That guy told me to do it only one time and get back to him. I didn’t. Because i won’t be able to look at him in his face like i used to before and hide the truth neither do i have the courage to tell him the truth. Even so, i continued doing it. Writing this makes me disgust at myself. How could i? \n\nThe first time i did it - let me tell you the story. We were in rough phase of our relationship. We used to fight because i started college and he was in a job where he has ample of time and my college was 7 to 9. 14 hours long. So i don’t had the time. To keep my mind sane from all the college stuff i spend time with my friends at a cafe and when i tell him this he used to be like you have time for friends and not me. The kind of things we talk about in the 15-20 minutes were also not quite like real talking as i was drained. Idk now i always put myself first. Maybe that was the reason of all that. But i was too tired to talk. Didn’t know what to do back then. After all this i met a guy who i used to consider as my big brother since he looked really and acted like my brother. But yeah long story short during that rough phase he flirted - i didn’t stopped him - had no limit/boundaries - he asked me to come to hotel - we did it. I was in complete auto pilot mode. Never even given once a thought about my partner. To make things worse i continued doing it from jan to aug last year. Complete 8 months.\n\nI broke off my on and off relationship in march without telling him the reason. Even when he insisted i tell him different reasons every time. My purpose was just to make my image bad in his mind since that would be easy for him to move on from me. Even after breaking up we used to talk on and off through text and calls since we both miss each other. I used to act cold since i didn’t want him to think of me as a nice person. I wanted him to curse me and move on from me. But how could he? He didn’t even had one proper reason. He loved me. I loved him every day, then, now and always. Even if we go separate ways. And i will regret everything i did and i don’t think i will ever move on since the thing i did is now a part of me that i will never forget. I can never forgive myself for my sins, even if he did.\n\nMy condition was getting worse so i blocked that person from everywhere who i was cheating with. That thing happened in august. I made up my mind in July-august to tell him everything. Even i tried telling him but words didn’t came out of my mouth. So i planned meeting him, since it would be easier to tell things in person. I booked the flight on his birthday. I met him - few days after told him everything - he was mad - i cried - i should not have - but i did. Even so we communicated this thoroughly but not in details or bit by bit. Before coming to meet him my only purpose was to tell him everything but won’t come in relationship since knew it won’t be the same again.\n\nBut when i get back after meeting him, old memories and connection ignite in both of us. We got back in the relationship. It will be a year in October since we got back together.\n\nNow, for you all please don’t tell me to leave him or get away from or he deserves better. It’s our mutual decision to be in this together. I want you all to help me out. As i am weak in emotions and expressions. LDR make things worse as our love language was physical touch. I don’t know now how to care for him and how to show effort. How to show what he means to me and how i am sorry for everything i did. I kind of know that he knows the last part me being sorry for my actions. I had expressed that much. He tells me to think of that as a mistake as i am very young and things like these are very common. I don’t think like that. I think whatever i did was a choice i made and a choice never equals a mistake. \n\nI want to get better for him and make efforts but how? He trust me in one thing that i won’t cheat again and i know i won’t. I just know i can’t convince anyone. \n\nWe fight a lot now because our fundamental is weak now. And there is a gap which is making us misunderstood each other and mess things up. In terms of physical relationship it’s same as before now it wasn’t like this before but we overcome it. But other than that - things are not looking nice. What should i do now?\n\nAsk me for more details but please help me and my relationship get better\nP.s - don’t tell me to leave him", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I’ve told her that I don’t feel safe that we are together and they are following each other on instagram. Today I’ve noticed that she’s now following his main account after she restricted him. And that his second account because apparently his main got hacked he is following her. I confronted over text message about asking why and she explained nothing besides the fact that she loves me and no matter what nothing can change her feelings towards me. But my trust is hurt and I feel like there is something deeper going on here. Why is she choosing to keep him in follow or following. Is that a back door. Is she doing it bc she wants him to know we are dating. AM I DELUSIONAL. idk. Any advice on this to be able to handle it would be greatly appreciated.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/AmgelicTeabag_135", "user": "u/AmgelicTeabag", "text": "Is it normal to not feel sexual attraction during your first meeting?\n\nWe (20F & 24M) have been dating for 10 months and i’m 99.99% sure he is the one. He’s everything I could’ve wished for in a partner and more. To say we are in love is an understatement, we are obsessed with each other, we get butterflies just at the very thought of each other, we understand each other as if we were long lost twins that finally got reunited after so long… and the sexual attraction we share is immense. We sext each other almost every day, I masturbate multiple times a day just because even the most innocent thoughts of him make me so incredibly horny… Most of my sexual fantasies are all about him and only him (though I myself am rarely, if ever, in them)… This is the man I ~want~ **Need** to marry and to have my babies, and he feels just as strongly. I never felt this much attraction and “oneness” to another person in my life.\n\nWe both thought that based on this, that our sexual attraction would be this unstoppable otherworldly force when we would meet for the first time, especially considering we were both virgins. It felt almost impossible for this not to be the case. After 8 months of yearning and never ending sexual tension, I was finally able to fly from the US to his country (France) to stay with him for two weeks in a nice quiet Airbnb apartment. We agreed to abstain from masturbation for a week before visiting in order to heighten our senses to the maximum (he failed at first, but was able to make it 5 days, and the first three days felt like literal torture to me). I spent a lot of money on sexy outfits/self care, wanting to make sure every little detail was perfect… We did have the smallest of doubts/anxiousness try to climb up within this week before meeting, but we didn’t think anything of it.\n\nWhen we finally met we were both very shy/anxious and a little awkward/uncomfortable around each other, as expected as we both have very bad social anxiety and are extremely introverted…\n We had spent a good amount of time prior discussing our expectations and boundaries of how our first meeting may go (we discuss absolutely everything together, there is nothing we don’t share). \n\nHe had reassured me numerous times (over a period of months, as I would keep checking in just in case he changed his mind) that he wanted me to show my full feelings for him and to “not hold back” even if he looked shy… So with this in mind, I tried my best to be as assertive about my love for him as is possible for my shy self. I immediately held his hand, kissed his cheek on the train, and started being “touchy” with him (nothing too inappropriate, mostly in a lovey/romantic way), but he seemed a bit uncomfortable with this despite his previous assurances. I asked him if he was okay, and he just said that he was anxious with being so openly romantic in public. \n\nAfter arriving at our AirBnB, we agreed that we would follow through our prior “plan” which was that we would take our showers then “spend time in bed” with only our underwear… Before his shower, I surprised him by placing his hands on my chest through my tank, which he got hard and started breathing a little heavily and looked completely amazed/astonished for about a minute before leaving to take his shower… I didn’t really feel anything from this, but I didn’t think much of it as my breasts aren’t the most sensitive. \n\nWe were both really shy/anxious when we got in bed for the first time, I think we touched each other through our underwear a little, and possibly even tried having sex? (it’s all really fuzzy to me so I forget), but we ended up just cuddling in the end instead as we couldn’t really make it work… “No problem”, I thought. It’s only our first day and we’re still getting used to each other. \n\n….Well the other days didn’t go much better. We would try a lot of things (mostly handjobs/blowjobs/him eating me out, playing with/sucking my chest, etc.) but nothing really felt good and he had a little trouble cumming/staying hard, and would only be able to finish from his own hand. This had really deteriorated my confidence as he would always say before meeting that he “would always be hard around me and wouldn’t be able to last more than two seconds”. He assured me that this was only because of his anxiety and that he still thought I was “the most attractive woman he’s ever seen” and that I was just as attractive (if not more) as I was in my pictures. We both voiced our shared disappointment in things not going the way we had wanted, but we agreed that we still were getting used to each other IRL and that it would get better with time. I was finally able to start consistently being able to make him cum without his help a week in after getting better with practice, which boosted my confidence a bit. But  throughout my whole trip he wasn’t able to make me cum even once (despite him putting so, so, so much incredibly selfless effort in trying his very best), which had made me a bit sexually frustrated at times (not at him, but more so on myself). \n\nWhenever we had sex, it felt more mechanical than anything. I was very excited about having it, as I always dreamed of doing so, but it felt like a battle to get my mind in the right place to feel any pleasure… For whatever reason, I felt almost numb and was mostly focused on his pleasure more than my own. He expressed that his anxiety had caused similar numbing effects (though less so than mine). Even kissing didn’t really feel like much…. though I still liked doing it just because I love him so much, and it’s not every day you get to kiss your partner. The only times I was able to feel any real pleasure/sexual attraction to him was when I was drunk (I apparently get super horny when drunk, so I began to see it as an “key” to unlocking this attraction) and maybe one or two very rare brief times during the whole trip sober. When I was drunk I couldn’t keep my hands off him, it felt like I was free to act without inhibition, and with this freedom came my desire. Kissing him felt actually *good*, like tingly good for the first time… and sex felt really good at some parts too (though still not anywhere as good as I imagined), I even felt like I could almost cum at one point… The only problem is that we could only drink in the evening, and that is when he gets tired, especially with alcohol involved, so a lot of the time I would be drunk and horny but he wouldn’t give it to me even if I would be practically begging…. There also was the problem that he just so happens to be most horny in the morning, but that is when I am most tired, so when he wanted to do it in the morning, I denied him to only a blowjob (not because he forced me, but because I still genuinely wanted to get him off as I will happily jump at any opportunity to do so for this man…). There were also times when we were getting really hot and heavy in which got ruined by little accidents like him knocking over a wine glass or by me throwing up on his manhood…. I also would be a little dry sometimes as we rushed things, and he would have trouble staying hard because apparently I was “too tight” that it hurt him?????? He also would understandably sometimes get a little upset as I would (to my guilt and regret) get a bit “pushy” about asking to have sex… I would ask for sex almost every day as I was in a lack mindset, thinking only about how we need to make the most use of this short time we have together or we’ll regret not having done more… During the last two days, we bought a toothbrush so I could masturbate (I can’t feel good with my fingers), and even though I was able to cum (in a separate room, I was too shy to have him watch), it still felt pretty numb…\n\nAfter our trip, we both discussed our feelings fully. He had said that he felt like we had moved too fast before we got fully comfortable with each other, and he regrets not taking things more slowly (like cuddling more, spending more quality time together rather than rushing to reach every milestone as soon as possible) and I agreed. I brought up my worry feeling like he wasn’t attracted to me (which in turn, hinders my ability to be attracted to him, as my attraction to men stems from our bond/connection rather than physical looks alone. I literally can’t look at a guy and be turned on, even if he is stereotypically “hot”), and he said that he was very sexually attracted to me but his anxiousness made it hard for him to display it. Even after confessing my lack of physical attraction to him during this trip (it almost immediately came back after), we concluded that we just needed more time to be comfortable with each other in person and that our attraction will follow. \n\nI want to believe that this theory will be true… I literally can’t imagine my life without him in it… and a good part of me does believe it, but another part is a bit worried as I always hear about how attraction is “instant”, or if it isn’t, it’s just because people haven’t developed enough of an emotional connection yet (which we already have in enough abundance to solve world hunger)… So my question is…  Is this normal? Do people usually have to get used to each other in person before developing sexual enjoyment/attraction to the other physically? Are we just very inexperienced? Could it be anxiety that is responsible? Will it get better with time?\n\nTLDR: I’m incredibly sexually attracted to my boyfriend… when we’re apart. During my two week trip together, I could only feel sexual attraction/enjoyment to him when drunk.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He slowly distanced with communication and blamed it on being busy with work, so I accepted it. I asked him multiple times if something was wrong, if he felt the distance was too much and if breaking up was something we should consider because the lack of communication was becoming hurtful to me. Every time he assured me everything was fine and that he loves me more than anything and if he wanted to break up he would do it.\n\nNot even two days after that conversation, he ignored me for almost 16 hours and then sent me a sloppy, misspelt drunk text that he doesn’t think he can do this anymore. I said it’s okay, I knew this was coming. He said I’ll always love you, and then I removed him off of everything. That was all what was said and that was it. \n\nIt’s so hurtful. I put so much time and effort and love into this relationship because I really saw us getting married and building a life together.

And they always chat with others first before paying me attention. Sometimes, they don't even reply to me but resumes chatting with others. (Discord Server) \n\nAfter one night, I thought they were asleep since they hadn't replied for hours, and I knew they were probably tired since they went out with a friend, I saw them chat with others again, not at all saying a word to me. I cry a lot and very easily, so after crying for a while again like the crybaby I am, I decided to test some things. \n\nI didn't chat first, I let them make the first move.

I just need advice on how I should approach this topic without it sounding like I want to give up on us. \n\nFor context, my boyfriend and I have been together a year and a half. We were together in person for about 4 months in the same country while I started university and he had just finished his undergrad. After that it’s been long distance since then, as he left to pursue a postgrad in a different country and I continued mine. We’re not super far apart, we’re both within Europe so at most we have an hour and a half flight from each other. During uni time, we were visiting each other about once a month, at least for a week each time. But now I’ve been home for the summer which is all the way in the US so it’s quite impractical to visit since flights are really expensive and we both only have part-time money. \n\nI’m not sure if it’s because it’s been 3 months without seeing each other that’s making it feel worse or if this feeling is arising in general, but sometimes it’s hard for me to feel like continuing to do the distance is worth it. We have no concrete plan to move in together after we graduate (I plan to do my masters and he plans to do his PhD but we both don’t know where yet) and being from the US also makes things complicated too. We’ve only had a brief talk about this, but it still didn’t really reach anywhere. I don’t know what will happen when we both graduate since I finish my undergrad and he finishes his postgrad at the end of this year. I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle doing the distance indefinitely especially since I feel like I’m not even completely satisfied with how things are now. \n\nI’m afraid that this feeling of “missing out” on the aspects of an in-person relationship are creating problems since I feel like I get irritated at him when there’s not really any reason for me to be, or I get upset and just keep bringing up old issues that I feel like are happening but are just in my head because of this feeling. He tries to hear me out each time, but lately it feels like I’m getting upset at the wrong things when it’s really this sentiment that’s causing it. I don’t know how to bring it up to him without it sounding like I want to break up because I don’t, and we have a non refundable trip to see each other in a couple of weeks. I just don’t know what to do or how to deal with feeling this way because if it gets any worse then I’d hate for it to cause a rift between us.

Last weekend, we went on a trip to a popular tourist spot in the country. It took us five hours to get there. Our stay was magical, at least until the last day.\n\nOn our final night, he asked me to wake up early so he could drive me home. We got up a bit late in the morning, which immediately pissed him off. I kept reassuring him that we'd be fine. After all, it was only 7AM. He seemed more annoyed by the fact that he had to drive such a long distance again. When he expressed his frustration, I didn’t argue. Instead, I suggested that I could just take the bus and he could head straight to his place, but he brushed it off.\n\nI stayed quiet the whole time, feeling like I was a huge inconvenience to him. A few hours into the trip, we got stuck in heavy traffic, and he kept complaining about it over and over. His behavior made me extremely anxious. I finally told him to pull over at the nearest restaurant where I could wait and find another way home. He did. He left me standing in this unfamiliar city. There were no Ubers. No cabs. I stood there clutching my bags, trying to be brave, as I watched him drive away without even saying goodbye. I had to ask around and wander the streets to figure out how to get home. In his defense, he thought I had already booked a ride.\n\nI felt abandoned. As soon as I got home, I broke up with him. I spent the whole day crying in bed. Our weekend had been spectacular, but that moment ruined everything. I wish he had done things differently. I wish he had been more patient, more considerate.\n\nI don’t know if this is something that can still be fixed, especially since he’s flying out of the country again soon. I might delete this post too because he's active here on Reddit. Right now, my heart hurts.

I (26M) and my girlfriend (27F) haven't had a real conversation for almost a month, and it's incredibly frustrating. For context: my girlfriend and I have been together for only a couple of months. She's really big on communication, which we both agree is needed for a healthy relationship, and going into it, we both knew that even though our communication was pretty good, we still needed to work on it, and we did, and our communication has drastically improved. Also, my girlfriend has bipolar 1 disorder, which will become important later.\n\n\nBack on August 23rd I texted her to see how she was doing, as she hadn't responded for a couple of days. She apologized and said she felt distant lately and was going through things. I assured her that there was no need to apologize and if she needs to talk to someone, that I will be there. She thanked me, and we didn't discuss it further. I gave her some space and texted her on her birthday, and she didn't reply at all. That was fine; I assumed she was celebrating and didn't really give it much thought. Another week passes, and I check in to see how she's doing and catch up a bit. She responded, texted me three times, and then went radio silent again. This would happen the next two times she actually responded to my texts, including a couple of days ago.\n\n\nNow the reason that her having bipolar 1 was important is that she could be going through a manic low, and it's really kicking her ass. Unfortunately, we live 1,300 miles apart (we both live in the US), and because of my work schedule, I can't fly out and see how she's doing, and she's the only person I can ask how she's doing, as I'm not connected to anyone else in her life. Her lack of responses is getting frustrating, and I feel guilty for being frustrated because of what she might be dealing with. However, I have dealt with her in a manic low before, and it only lasted a couple of days, and then she was back to her normal self.\n\n\nMy question is, should I bring this up to her and how, or should I wait and hope the whole situation resolves itself?

She knew that I don't live in her city and was visiting. We live 4-5 hours away in different cities. First date, then after a couple of weeks we had a second date and then a third. \n\nBy the time we were going to go out on a fourth, I had decided that I would ask her to be my girlfriend because I felt that I finally found someone that I find the perfect combination of pretty, personality and doesn't give me an ick.\n\nI was drunk when I asked her out and she said yes. In the heat of the moment I also said I love you to her. She said she feels the same. I was so over the moon.\n\nA month later she mentioned over a video call that she did not actually mean it, it was just too emotional for her when I confessed to her and she wants to be honest now. While I appreciate the fact that she came out clean, something inside me became wary. I didn't know how to trust this person anymore now. A month later she said it herself though that she loves me.\n\nIn that call, she mentioned how she wants someone who is intellectual and so that she can talk to him on things other than your regular check-ins and the daily updates. I'm not the dumbest person on the earth, nor am I the smartest. I do ok in most things.\n\nThe last we met were in mid August and since then we have not met. For the past few weeks, I am noticing that she is not enthusiastic about us. This is giving me anxiety and making life difficult for me. I feel-\n\n1. Either she is bored with me or doesn't find me interesting anymore (because I'm not the most intellectual)\n2. That I'm not a priority anymore\n\nWe talk everyday at night for an hour at least. Some days where one of us has a lot of work or when she has gone out with her friends and has smoked up, she would say that she is tired and just wanna go to bed. This has happened a few times in recent weeks.\n\nToday, while I was out, I said to her that I wanna talk to you over call and I can't because by the time I return home you'd be asleep, her response gave off the energy that she doesn't even feel bad about the fact that we would not be able to see each other. For the last 2 days we could not talk over video calls because she was out with her friend and later too tired to call me. I called her in the afternoon and when she picked up the call, it felt as if I am interrupting her.\n\nWhile texting after returning to home, I said that I miss her very much and idk how she copes with this distance, she said that it sucks. She feels disconnected. She is not feeling things and would like to have a face to face conversation later when we meet in a week's time.\n\nMy birthday is coming up and we're going to go on our first vacation together. It will be a short 3 day trip where it will be just two of us. I'm getting very anxious about where she's going with this.\n\nI can't mention every thing in the post because I get lost while talking about one thing and start talking about altogether a different thing, so if youwanna ask something specific, ask away.\n\nTLDR: Gf wants to have a talk about things she ain't feeling and it's making me anxious af.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Advice needed.\n\nHey Reddit, I need some outside perspective on my long-distance relationship because I'm starting to feel crazy.\n\nMy (34M) girlfriend (29F) lives in Spain and I live abroad. We've been together for a while (more than 3 years together) and I’m mostly doing all the travelling as I’m more flexible and earn more than she does. For the last year, the plan was decided for me to move to her but sometimes I have my doubts due to quality of work, lack of support network, etc. She is willing to move in the future, but she cannot do that now due to her work.\n\nLately, she's been frustrated that my job search in Spain hasn't been moving as quickly as she'd like. I'll be honest, it's been hard to find the motivation. It's a huge move, leaving my job/family/friends behind is daunting, and the job market is tough. I'm committed, but I'm struggling with the pace.\n\nHere's the current issue: Her friend is having a birthday party in Spain soon, and I really wanted to go. It's a chance to see her and her friends and feel connected to my future life there. I told her I was planning to book a flight and attend the party.\n\nShe got angry and told me that she doesn’t want me to come to the party. Her reasoning is that if I use my money and time to fly over for a \"fun trip,\" it takes away the urgency for me to find a job and move. She says it's a \"waste\" and that I should only come when I have a job secured. She also outright refuses to visit me here for the same reason—to \"force\" me to be the one to make the move.\n\nI feel like this is incredibly manipulative. She's using a fun event I was excited about as a punishment to pressure me into acting faster. It feels less like she's my partner and more like she's my manager withholding a reward.\n\nOn one hand, I get her frustration. She wants us to live in the same country and feels I'm not moving fast enough. On the other hand, I feel like her method is controlling and is making me more resistant and anxious about the entire move, not less.\n\nSo, Reddit, is her tactic a normal level of frustration in a long-distance relationship, or is it a major red flag?\n\nTL; DR: My GF in Spain is forbidding me from visiting her for a friend's birthday party. She says it's to \"force\" me to focus on finding a job there so I can move, instead of taking fun trips. She also refuses to visit me for the same reason.

We became close very quick, practically lived together for a year before he had to leave the country this June. I also went home to my home country due to many reasons, and while I was home my beloved dad unexpectedly departed to a nicer world. I stayed at my home country for the whole summer, supporting family and finding comfort for myself too. My boyfriend came to visit, even a few days after the tragedy happened, providing me support for a few days, and we met up halfway once too. So went to living together to seeing each other once a month in a turbulent way with challenging circumstances.\n\nNow I am back in the city where we met - alone. Lots of getting used to, without him, without my dad at home. I’m trying to stay afloat. It’s a wild rollercoaster, sometimes I’m motivated and productive, but I have my bad days and occasional breakdowns. I could really use some support, care, affection.\n\nOn my bf’s side, he moved out of our shared city because he had to, not because he wanted to. We both live in Europe, no time difference, but both on a student budget so visits aren’t every 2 weeks.\n\nHe’s also struggling with a few things; wanted to find a job here, for a year he couldn’t and had to move, now he’s living with his family; big change in living conditions and general circumstances. His master program started this week, but he’s not particularly excited to be back to school, this was his safety plan only.\n\nWhen I expressed that i would appreciate a bit more support, he said he needs to focus on himself, because “he can’t be there for me if he can’t be there for himself in the first place”. We had many talks about this during the summer, when he had nothing to do, was doing sports all day, and became a little distant.\n\nI decided to give him some space, texting him less and reaching out less. He sometimes wouldn’t text for 6-8 hours, forgetting to say goodnight bc “he’s too tired”, not texting back or not updating me on anything unless I ask.\n\nOn my part, like before, I can’t wait to tell him things, I want to send pictures, videos. He was sceptical about going long distance, although in less than 2 years we could close the gap. I encouraged him saying we can watch stuff together, organise date nights, send letters or whatever on the post, use funny apps to stay connected, even visit almost every month!!\n\nI’m at a halt now. I really don’t want to break up. We are good and can be so in love when we’re together, I can’t wait to build a life with him. I was hoping when school starts for him he’ll have a routine and will feel a little more in place, but he’s still a little distant, isn’t bothered about me taking back a little.\n\nHow do you guys see the situation? I also don’t want to go on a “break” as that wouldn’t lead to anything good imo. This is worth so much more than to just let it go, but I’m afraid I’m annoying him and I don’t want him to resent me.

He can change his dates for the flight. But he has said he wants to see me. He hasn’t told me if he has taken leave on the week of my holiday. I can’t afford to go because it is too soon and too expensive. So I am not certain he will come to meet me on my holiday week. I am just worried about our future. He has his mortgage to pay so he can’t just leave and be with me. I mentioned he can do a work holiday visa or student. But he can’t sell his house because of his mortgage. And I can’t leave because I have to pay my car loan which doesn’t end until 23 August 2027. So all we can do is text and call each other which we haven’t done in a while. And try to see each other when we have the time and money. Is it worth sticking it out or should I move on? I thought I could do it but it is hard. I am already struggling to pay bills and my manager is mean to me and puts me down a lot I think because of my background and me being an introvert. I don’t know what to do. But I will keep trying to make this relationship work. I don’t know how it will go in the next few months. I also plan to go to UK next year.

I read through all your advice, and it really helped me clear my head. Like many of you suggested, I didn’t wait too long before bringing it up.\n\nWhen I confronted him, he broke down. He cried, admitted everything, and begged me for forgiveness and a last chance. The only thing I can be thankful for in that moment is that he didn’t deny it or make excuses, he owned up to his mistakes.\n\nAt first, I was still in shock. My immediate thought was to leave him, but I didn’t want to make such a big decision while I was overwhelmed and emotional. After journaling and taking time to process, I decided to give him one last chance. I know some of you may think that’s foolish, and maybe it is, but after 5 years together, with him never once treating me badly or giving me a reason to doubt him, it didn’t feel right to throw everything away in one moment.\n\nSince then, he’s deactivated his Twitter and voluntarily gave me access to all of his social media accounts. He even screen-shared everything with me, though I didn’t ask him to. I know these gestures can’t erase what he did, but right now, in our situation, all I can do is take his words and actions and see if he follows through.\n\nHe told me he isn’t just asking for another chance because he doesn’t want to lose me, but because he truly believes he can make things right again and rebuild my trust and confidence in us.\n\nFor those wondering why we haven’t met yet, that’s been my choice, and he’s always respected it. I have personal reasons, but they’re unrelated to this situation, but we are both consenting adult, me 23, him 26. I still believe he is a good person, otherwise I wouldn’t feel this deeply hurt and disappointed by him. If he had been cruel or careless throughout our relationship, none of this would cut as deeply as it does.\n\nI know this isn’t the decision everyone would make, but for now, it feels right for me. My hope is that time will show me whether his words and promises are genuine.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We are not even official and when we do see each other it is only for a day or two. He has only visited me twice in June and now planning again next weekend. I flew to him in August for his birthday, paid for my own flight, and stayed with him. He covered meals but I got the cheapest stuff since I am dieting. While I was there, he also kind of ambushed me into meeting his parents, which I was not ready for. His most recent flight was 106 dollars.\n\nAt first he said traveling every month would not be an issue, but now he frames flights as a sacrifice and says he is “busting his chops for me.” He even includes his normal responsibilities like work, frat stuff, and family obligations as part of that. To me those are things he has to do anyway. They do not lighten my load or build closeness, so I do not see them as sacrifices for me.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how he responds when I voice my needs. I have asked multiple times for intentional FaceTime dates, things like setting a time to watch a show, ordering dinner for us to eat together, or sending paint kits. Instead, all we do is late night phone calls when we are both tired. No consistent gestures, no flowers anymore, no planning. And when I bring this up, he centers how my honesty makes him feel, saying things like “I feel deflated” or “you are dismissing my efforts.” The focus shifts to his emotions instead of action.\n\nThis is the third time in three months I have raised this and not much has changed. He says I am his top priority, but if that were true I would not feel like my needs are always last. Instead of planning or effort, I get long explanations and defenses.\n\nAm I wrong for expecting consistency, intentionality, and small gestures, or are my needs simply not being met here.

{"id": "u/OrganicKale186_179", "user": "u/OrganicKale186", "text": "Found my boyfriend’s Twitter account… I don’t know how to process what I saw\n\nHi everyone, I really need some advice right now.\n\nThis morning I installed Twitter and followed my boyfriend’s account, the one he gave me just the other day. I didn’t think much of it, since he handed it over without hesitation, and I already knew he’s very active on Twitter. But when I started browsing through his feed, I was honestly shocked by what I found. It wasn’t hidden at all, just out in the open.\n\nFor context, we’ve been in a long-distance relationship since 2020 (5 years now). We’ve never met in person yet, but we’ve never had a serious fight that put our relationship at risk. That’s why I don’t even know how to react to this.\n\nThe first thing I checked was his following list, and I saw about 10 OnlyFans accounts. This already felt off to me because I’ve complained about this before (on Instagram). Back then, he told me he unfollowed them and that it was just from way back. But now it’s happening again on Twitter.\n\nThen I went through his replies, and that’s when it really hit me:\n\nTo a girl’s picture, he asked AI (Grok) to edit her photo into a skirt with her tongue out.\n\nTo another, he replied: “my dick is hard.”\n\nAnother reply: “Want my family to gangbang u f***ing slut.”\n\n“Such long legs” on a bikini photo.\n\n“Masturbate to u in the streets.”\n\n“Now post boobies.”\n\n“Such lovely breasts 😭💗.”\n\n“Post nude for the boys.”\n\nTo a question about how he’d spend $1,000, he replied: “OnlyFans.”\n\nOn a girl’s video: “This is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen.”\n\nAnd the one that shattered me most: he shared a screenshot (looked like WhatsApp). In it, he sent a photo of a black couple where the guy was grabbing the girl’s butt, captioning it “you and I soon.” The person replied, “yes sir but I’m not black,” and he said, “Posting this on the internet.”\n\nAll of these were posted around 2022-2024\n\nI honestly don’t know what to do with all of this. Part of me feels completely betrayed, another part of me is just numb. He gave me his account openly, so I’m confused why he didn’t hide any of this. I don’t even know how to bring it up or whether this is something I can come back from.\n\nOn top of all this, I’m struggling with when and how to bring it up. He just started a new job that he and I been waiting and praying for over the past month, and it’s a huge step for his career. The company is in another city, so he’s about to move and start this new chapter in his life. A part of me feels hesitant because of that, like I don’t want to weigh him down while he’s busy and focused on this transition. At the same time, I feel like I’m sidelining my own feelings, and it makes me pity myself for even thinking that way.\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/s/Yu6IM1w8V4", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/Busy-Carbo6470_182", "user": "u/Busy-Carbo6470", "text": "My (23f) partner (25m) tested me and I don’t know how to feel about it\n\nPretty much what the title says.\n\nTLDR at the bottom\n\nFor context my partner and I have been going through a bit of a rough patch both as individuals and as a couple. He’s been really stressed with work and finances and managing a house on his own (even though his family live with him they don’t really help out and leave a mess that he has to clean up), he’s in a lot of pain and will potentially need surgery for an ongoing problem, not to mention the political climate (he lives in the USA). I’ve been struggling to find a full-time job, been recovering from surgery myself, the political climate here (UK) is scary and I’ve had some family issues going on. Not to mention we’ve both been feeling the distance a little more than usual. So we’ve both been really stressed and a little snappy with one another but we’ve always been able to circle back and talk it through.\n\nI’d just returned to my part time job yesterday after two months off, a six hour cleaning shift at a fairly popular gym and pool - so nothing too egregious but it was still a challenge for me because my surgery site was causing me some pain and there’d been some changes at the gym that I had to adapt to.\n\nMy partner also works Saturdays (overtime) and after which he would call me. This call comes through at around 8-9pm my time. My partner called me at this time yesterday but I was still at work, no big deal I just assumed he forgot and sent him a message reminding him. He then replies ‘yes but you still could’ve answered’ - which, for the record, unless it was an emergency I really couldn’t have. I have to be on the go the entire time because my managers think 6 hours is plenty of time to do 12 hours worth of work. But he sent the ‘👀’ and ‘what if I was dying’ so I just assumed it was meant to be a joke.\n\nI joked back that if it was an emergency knowing him I wouldn’t have found out until after it happened (which is true, there’s been a couple times where emergencies have happened and I’ve not found out until after they’ve been sorted) and, just in case he was being serious, told him that if it had been any other time I would’ve answered first thing or if he had spammed called me.\n\nHe doesn’t reply to my messages. I get home, call him, but he’s busy so we don’t really do anything. He texts me today saying he still would’ve appreciated if I’d have answered and that he ‘obviously knew I was working’ and that he ‘answers [my] calls when [he’s] working’ (which to my memory I’ve never called him while he’s working so maybe he has a point there) and that he shouldn’t have to spam call me to get through to me in an emergency. I acknowledged his point, apologised, and explained that if I had any inkling that it was an emergency and not just his regular end of day call I would’ve picked up on the first ring no hesitation. He then told me that it wasn’t an emergency and he just wanted to see if I’d answer so he knew who to call if it was, along with the 👍🏻 and 👌🏻 emojis which I thought was a bit petty.\n\nI reminded him that not once have I not answered his call - excluding the times it didn’t connect properly at which point I called him back straight away. And he’s left me on read.\n\nI find myself being angry because he knew this was my first day back at work in two months after surgery, that I needed to adjust to everything and see how the pain levels were on my surgery site, and he decided now was the best time to test me. And not only that he had me feeling guilty for missing an emergency when it wasn’t even an emergency, he just wanted to see if I’d be there for him which, in my opinion, I have been (I was there when he fell off a roof, I was there when his mum tried to off himself, I’ve been there for him and helping with financial issues whenever I could). But on the other hand if he genuinely felt the need to test me on this then I’m worried if I’ve somehow let him down somewhere.\n\nTLDR: partner called me on my first day of work in two months, then when I didn’t answer acted like it was an emergency that I’d missed, then told me it wasn’t an emergency he just wanted to see if I’d answer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

It turns out his sister was actually going to have him work his ass off and ask him to pay for everything she has done for him. At first, they made an agreement that he will have a part time job and then uni (stufent loan) and that he'll pay half the rent monthly (but he's only sleeping in the couch since there's no other room, and his sister has a live in partner). It was really hard for him since he has uni in the morning 9am - 3pm then 12 hour shift at 5:30pm -5:30 am. \n\nAfter a month, his sister was expecting him to pay for everone everytime they went out, and then he asked him to pay for the grocery as well (so basically he's now shouldering half the rent, groceries, and shopping despite only sleeping in a couch). And then last January, he found out that his sister had withdraw his all his savings (around 5k euros), and when he confronted her, she snapped saying that she has every right to withdraw anytime since she did a lot for him. And he wasn't really able to fought back since he was also feeling guilty as well and she's the only family he has. \n\nEver since that time things between them have been intense and his sister asked him to also shoulder the water and internet bill (basically almost everything). Just recently, he was planning to move out and had already save another 5k euros when he found out that it was stolen again. He was really at lost because he's been really working hard for it, he was also hoping that he would be able to visit me. \n\nHe's now in 2nd yr uni and his schedule has been more busier and he's not really able to sleep much now. And the company that he's been working at suddenly announces that they only have one month to stay and that they should start to find a job now. He's worried about how to pay his tax (he said that if he didn't get to pay, he'll get arrested) and he doesn't really have anything with him anymore and he's afraid that his sister is going to get his money again, he says that he's been through enough and I honestly cant argue with that and he said that he doesn't think that he can still go on.\n\n*****His mom died when he was around 3yrs old, his father left them before he was born, he had a really tough life here and it's honestly not better in the uk as well.\n\nI can't really do anything since my family (it's broken as well, and my mom is the only one supporting us) isn't really well off and we're also having a hard time with my college fees and brother's tuition. ******", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Right now she is in residential german institution. We dont get alot of time to talk to each other cuz of her schedule over there the most we get is like 15 mints per day excpet sat and sun where i dont have school. But the problem is there are several time slots over there where they have to do self study after her classes.

We met through an Xbox group post and while we were still in high school, she is three months older than me but she was a junior, and I was a senior during the time we'd send pictures when we got out and talk during the school day about what we did. She was the first girl to look at me and say I didn't look bad, and she liked me cause of how I acted, cause I was caring and how I was worried about her. She was never good at expressing herself and emotions through text, but on the phone, it was okay. She used to send pictures once ina while. I comforted her when she got stressed from work, stayed on the phone just for our presence, and a bunch of other stuff, sent relationship reels of how we want to be, and other stuff. We got close pretty quick when we had met last year she got attached to me very quick cause not even two weeks of me and her talking she had asked me \"Are we going to stay friends or is this going to be something bigger\" when i first heard that i said just friends cause it was WAY to soon but five six months later she asked again this time i had said no only for the fact that she lived in AL while im in CT. I gave it two months and asked her if she wanted to be my gf. She was quick to say yes. After that work drained her, her first job was as a waiter, and it stressed her a lot, so I was always there to comfort her and make sure she was okay. She was dry the majority of the time, but I would put in effort to make talks long over text and we'd call so we could actually talk it was great our longest call was 2 days she always had her camera on and I never turned it on because I don't like how I look but now I wish I spent more time with her. but the dryness caught up to me and I pretty much told her that I'm no longer going to try and start a conversation because there is no point to start one if its not going anywhere and that's what I wish i didn't do because she saw that as I was giving up and I don't blame her cause after that she said \"it sucks that we're not talking\" and then she said the reason she slowed down on messages was because I have a terrible sleep schedule and I never told her I was awake but at the same time I don't sleep long and i can stay up for a while with little rest. She sent intimate no nudes or anything just showing more of herself but two weeks before we broke up she deleted those pictures off snap because she \"Didn't want anyone to see them\" and \"it was more of a her thing\" and \"im growing up and i dont want that stuff on my phone\"so I had asked her if she felt like breaking up and her response \"No it just felt like we were drifting apart, has it for you\" and I was honest I said yea a couple of times but I didn't go through because I knew she was more quiet due to the stress from her job. but after that I wrote the break up message and said we should be friends and better ourselves and maybe get back together her response \"i understand and im sorry it's come down to it i would like to stay friends and maybe in the future it could work out but right now the distance is what screwed us over and i understand i should have said something sooner about the calls, you seemed so happy i didn't want to ruin it for you, and my job started to drain me so i didn't want to talk recently I hate that this happened the same time we were trying to make this work but it did, but in the end i completely understand and if you want to stay friends that is okay with me \". I applied for jibs before we broke up and i finally got a job offer from one and i was going to use that to talk to her again but i had constantly been checking her followers and following and saw her like thirst trap accounts and other men flexing off their bodies with nsfw texts and that stung and she's done this before but i told her it made me uncomfortable and she apologized and undid what she did but she unfollowed them and a couple hours after she followed them and I don't know if I should go back to talking to her to try and reconnect\n\nI can take criticism and sorry its kinda all over the place if you have any questions i most likely have answers\n\nKey things/ things i didn't know where to put in with the writing\n\nBroke up due to poor communication,\n\nshe felt ignored and i messed up by spending too much time with friends\n\nnever sent anything cause I'm broke and she wanted to send me things but i denied because I wouldn't have anything to send back\n\nshe liked and followed thirst trap and model accounts\n\nmy messed up sleep schedule made it worse\n\nshe still looks at my stories\n\ni unfollowed her on tiktok and snap\n\nshe was scared of losing me and kept telling me she wanted the relationship but it crumbled", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

It's all gone, I'm back to being lonely again which is not easy if you talked for 3 years everyday..\nI guess this is a little cry for help me posting this a way to cope with this situation", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Similary, she would say she needed a job, and if I ask her 2, 3 days whether she is studying or not for the job then she will respond by saying,\"Oh that means, if i dont get a job, you wont marry me\", also, everytime there is a fight , she will go silent. I request her so many times, please talk to me, communicate, but she would say so many things to me, everytime I will say sorry just to end the fight, and at the end as a last resort, I have to call her bestfriend (26F) , so that at least she can make her understand,  but the happens in a loop, like fight start > going slient> trying to communicate with her for 3-4 days> calling her BFF as last resort. \n\nBut whenever I call her BFF I came to know from her that I was being portrayed as a cheap person, who doesn't care for her, who does not do anything for her.

For example he used to lie about what was he doing just small things like “I didn’t do anything today I js stayed at home”“I went with my family to buy some food”and when I confronted him about it he just said that he is afraid of not being interested enough and scared of my leaving him. So we talked about, he said he would not lie again because I really love him and find interesting about him even if he doesn’t do anything. We shared our social media accounts and when I met him and got in the relationship he always said he lived in a specific city. Then I was just curious about reading some chats and found out he doesn’t even live there and he lives in a whole different town also making plans to go to parties with friends (he told me about the party and even sent pictures of it) but that whole time I thought that was in the specific city he told me before, turns out he lives like 4 hours away from that place and when i confronted him again he started getting anxious and nervous about “being afraid of telling where he is from because its really boring and he only goes to the specific city when he was studying “ I was really disappointed because he told he would not do it again and that he doesn’t know why he lies. I really think that was stupid because I told him I am not from a good place, I lived in towns my whole life so why would he feel like that’s something to be embarrassed about when i come from one? Gotta admit, yeah his family is good economically more than my family, having like 2 houses or 3 in different places so why lying about it?. Well we also talked about it, I talked about how I always tell him everything, I’m like an open book and I don’t know how to feel about this. Yesterday was my birthday and he always post his friends in social media, saying congratulations and posting photos of them in his story. I don’t really like my birthday and he asked if he could post about my birthday, I told yeah I had no problem with it because even though I don’t find my birthday exciting I wouldn’t say no to a cute act of love. I spent all day waiting for him to post me on his social media because he is always like “I want the whole world to know I really love you I dont care” And then I told him why he didn’t post about me and that I felt bad now asking for it because I want him to do it without asking like he does with his friends. He told that he thought it was a bad idea since I don’t like my birthday that much and that he sorry we would do it right now.  I took a quick screenshot about how many people he had hiding from stories before, (it was 20) and then after he posted me I just went to check and he hides his story for (58 people????)  this was in instagram btw. He never did that with the people he loved and that really broke me. Again, I confronted him about it and he said he didn’t do anything,  then i sent the screenshots and he just started getting nervous and anxious saying he sorry and He doesn’t know why he didn’t that. At that time I was going to a restaurant with my family to celebrate and got really sad because I always post about him and how I love him and I just feel he’s trying to hide myself from other people? The same happened in tiktok like doing a joke in our stories saying “I love my partner so much” I checked his account and the search history said “how to hide my story for certain people” at that time I just ignored it and deleted it but now that this happened in my birthday makes me think he feels embarrassed about me or he doesn’t want other specific people to know (in that tiktok account he only had online friends added and not even a single relative or irl friend) and then i added that situation to the topic yesterday along with the instagram topic and he just kept saying that hes sorry. The thing that really broke me was him hiding his story for 58 PEOPLE in my birthday and not his friends.

But now that it’s happening, I’m spiraling.\n\nThey’re going out all the time and it feels like they’re on dates while I’m just… watching from the sidelines. I can’t stop imagining them showering in the same place, getting ready together, sharing these little intimate moments. To make it worse, she originally asked him to share a bed before the trip, which he refused — now they have two separate beds. Also, I found is so strange that she asked him this question when she knows about us. \n\nTo be fair, he’s been trying really hard to reassure me. He apologizes every day, sends me constant updates, and even got different beds to make me feel better. But no matter what he does, I’m still angry, jealous, and overthinking everything. It’s exhausting.\n\nAnother layer to this is that he can be pretty controlling with me — he checks my Instagram daily, looks through my likes, comments on what I wear, etc. So part of me feels frustrated that I’m bending over backwards to manage his comfort, but when it comes to mine, I’m the one struggling to adjust.\n\nHis ex apparently hated this same female friend, which makes me wonder if I’m just another person “insecure for no reason” or if there’s something deeper going on. I feel like I’m losing my mind, and I don’t know if this is just my insecurities talking or if my boundaries are genuinely being crossed.\n\nHow do I cope with this?\n\n\t•\tHow do I calm the constant intrusive thoughts?\n\t•\tAnd most importantly… how do I figure out what healthy boundaries should look like here?\n\nAny advice would mean a lot right now.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

For some context, we met online about 15 years ago and we started chatting. We were actually not that far from each other, same country different cities, but since we were teenagers( 17 close to 18) , it wasn't easy to meet regularly. We were together for about 2 years and during that time we met 3 times. \n\nAt first everything was great but after a few weeks he started changing... He started posting about other girls all the time, how he wanted more girls to talk with, how pretty he find them and how it was easy to get a second girlfriend because his actual girlfriend ( me ) was in a different city and couldn't check what he is doing... He will always tell me that i wasn't pretty enough and how easy it was for him to get any girl he wanted... he will yell at me even for the smallest things, ghost me for hours and even talk bad about me to other girls... and I know it's my fault for staying even though I knew what he was doing but I was young, I had no friends and didn't know any better... \n\nHe ended up cheating on me with one of the girls he hang out with and he even posted about her before we even broke up... \n\nI'm not gonna lie, he broke me. Like actually broke my heart into so many pieces, it was so hard to trust someone else again...He made me extremely insecure and feel like I wasn't enough. \n\nFast forward to now aka 3 months ago, we accidentally met in my city and tbh I didn't even realize it was him at first. Talking with him again casually was actually nice, like all those things from the past never happened.\n\nWe ended up exchanging numbers and talked from time to time. He moved to my city for work recently and he didn't know anyone except from me.\n\nLast month he sent me a text apologizing for what he did, for treating me that way and for being a terrible boyfriend. He explained some things to me about back then and told me that I was the only girl that was actually kind to him.\nI honestly didn't except it at all and his apology felt genuine. I actually didn't think much about it but what triggered me was when he said he still has feelings for me... he asked if I could give him a chance to make things right... \n\nI haven't replied to him yet but ever since then the more he tries to talk to me the more i feel like everything he says its a lie... I keep thinking about what happened back then and it still breaks me...\n\nThe funny thing is, regardless of all that I still wish him well... even after all those years and all that pain, I'll still help him or be there for him... \n\nBut thinking about loving him or being with him feels like stabbing my heart... like I'm in hell and there is no escape\n\nPs.

Today is the anniversary of us meeting in person for the first time after knowing each other for roughly 7 years. I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and today I feel especially low and really miss him. I woke up way before him, sent him a good morning message and message about how I love and appreciate him for being someone I can trust, started doing stuff and he didn’t message me saying good morning until 1pm or so. Totally fine, there’s a 2 hour time difference for us and he was up late gaming so I was just happy to hear from him. We talked for a few minutes and then he let me go to kind of doing morning routine stuff and I was a little bummed but still understanding.

she doesn’t even know me. so i screenshot and sent it to my bf and he got soooo mad and he was like she’s crazy she’s had a crush on me for years blah blah blah just ignore her. okay… so i did, this ain’t my business and i don’t like drama, i thought it was just as he said, she was some crazy girl who was still obsessed with him 🤷‍♀️\n\nbut i went on holiday with my family, and for some reason it was bugging me so much, i had so many questions in my head like firstly why would she go as far as requesting to follow me and why would he react that strongly. something just didn’t sit right with me and i had a gut feeling that there was more to this story. so i accepted her follow request a few days later and requested to follow her back and she messaged me a couple days later saying that she can help me. like girl excuse me? i was confused so i was like um do i know you? and y’all she told me she was my boyfriend’s girlfriend. my jaw was on the floor and i was honestly just flabbergasted. like what the hell am i reading. it was bombshell after bombshell, y’all remember that ring i was talking about, yeah apparently she got it for him and they promised MARRIAGE to eachother, and according to her it had her name on it and she sent me a pic of the ring he gave her that mind you she was still wearing. y’all i was just *insert pikachu face meme* \n\nanyways after that shockwave passed she told me the story of their love/relationship whatever and how they were together for 7 years since 2018, 7 goddamn years! so imagine my shock. i was also confused as hell because he spent almost everyday for a whole year sleeping on call with me, FaceTiming me at random times any time we both could tbh, we were texting 24/7 like we always found time for eachother but apparently their relationship was on “hold” while he got his life together so that would explain why he had so much time for me. she then said they were not together until further notice so that he could get out of their country to have a better life and then bring her over and marry her and so there were a few cracks in her argument which although sounded unbelievably believable, i found it hard to believe because (1) of how real our relationship is (2) there was no timestamps on any of the “evidence” she showed me and (3) she claimed she new about me a year ago, i wouldn’t just idly stand by and watch my man get into a WHOLE ASS relationship with another girl like what??!! be so fr! she claims she “let him” because he kept reassuring her that it was only for “papers” to come over here to my country to live and work etc and that he doesn’t actually love me… guys honestly im just so speechless reliving this, i was speechless then and im speechless now! she told me she’s so in love with him she’s willing to forgive him for all of this because APPARENTLY he kept telling her to patient and to not be jealous and that it’s all gonna be worth it and all this shit like am i in a high school drama or smth 😭😭😭 \n\ny’all im trying my best to be coherent and not miss anything out but its hard like every time i try to keep my cool, i remember all of this and i get so shocked and angry like how can anyone keep their cool in a situation like this, i planned a trip to meet him (it’s easier for me to visit him than vice versa) in december and this just made me pause in my tracks \n\nokay lemme just finish this story before i lose my mind, she asked me not to tell him anything, i said alright, (just until i got all the “facts” lol so i could talk to him about EVERYTHING) i was fuming, and she asked me about our relationship, i sent her a screenshot of our most recent conversation to SHOW HER that we are very much in love and we had JUST spoken to eachother before he left for work. like damn she had me really contemplating if any of this shit is even real like dude.. NOBODY can fake being in love for that long!! or can they? i dont fucking know so she dropped another bomb that she had his instagram and facebook accounts so she saw allll of our messages/reels etc (😋 how fun) so she was basically stalking us and our chats and i was creeped tf out so that was really the cherry on top for me and to her it “proved” that they were still together because she STILL had his accounts yaay :) (can you tell im trying not to crash out)  \nand amazingly after telling ME not to tell him, she had the audacity to send him a screenshot of MY CONVERSATION WITH HIM (the one i sent her) and it all went to shit \n\nhe started blowing up my phone, she also blew up my phone, i felt so overwhelmed and im ngl even 2 whole days later when it all died down i feel so overwhelmed it’s unreal. he told me that she’s lying and that everything she’s saying is a lie and i so desperately want to believe him but some of the things she said really really got to my head. he said they broke up 2 years ago and he told her to leave him tf alone when she threatened to talk to me after she found out about me, he said he changed the passwords to his accounts so he doesn’t know how she still had them, and the ring? he threw it out and took a video to prove it to me \n\nso im just lost y’all i wont even lie, im hurt, confused, torn and to make things worse i even felt bad for her even tho she didnt have to do all this, i confronted her and told her that he said they broke up 2 years ago but she said they broke up last year… so this shit isn’t adding up for me and im just confused, ill never fully know the truth and ive accepted it, but im just idk, i love him but deep down i know im gonna struggle so bad to move past this even if i seem totally fine on the outside. i really question his decision making skills because the reason he didn’t tell me the truth about her was because he was scared i was gonna leave him \n\nsorry this is such a long post guys, if you got this far i just want to say thank you so so much from the bottom of my heard for reading, and i just wanna know what you guys would do in my position? i really need help and idk where else to look", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Looking for advice regarding US health insurance, travel insurance, and hospital bills. What can we do?\n\nHi guys, this is our first time posting looking for advice. To be honest, it’s kind of a hail Mary. But we're really needing/hoping we could receive some guidance on what to do with my current situation. Apologies in advance for any reddit mistakes and thank you for your patience.\n\nTLDR; My (29M, US citizen) fiancée (30F, Brazilian) is visiting for a couple months on a tourist visa while we wait for her K1-Fiancée visa to be approved. Six days into visiting she was in a grease fire accident which resulted in 3rd degree burns to all of her right arm and hand from the bicep down, her right thigh and the majority of her left leg and foot. She’s now out of the hospital and recovering. Her travel insurance medical expenses are capped out at $150,000 and they said they are not negotiating prices with the hospital, leaving us with potentially over $112,000 in medical debt unless something can be done to help reduce it. This whole thing has been devastating and a nightmare. We've been in an LDR for almost 6 years, and right before we’re finally starting our life together, this happens. Any advice, tips or tricks to navigating this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA little background on us and the circumstances around her visiting the US. My fiancée and I have been in a long-distance relationship for 6 years come October. We are currently going through the K1-Fiancée visa process and are approaching the final stages, where she will be required to visit the U.S. embassy in Brazil to finish the process.  Back in July, she was amicably released from my full-time job in Brazil. She was given advance notice of her last day, so we decided she should travel to the US for a few months on her tourist visa while we wait. The logic was if she have nothing to do because she’s unemployed, she might as well be here with me during it and help set up the apartment for her permanent arrival.\n\nShe arrived on August 4th and everything was going great. Then on August 9th, while I was away at work she was trying to cook lunch for me. She was doing a deep fry recipe, but it was her first (and last) time ever deep frying anything (her words). The oil started smoking and then caught on fire. She wasn't sure what to do when the flames started to reach the wooden cabinets above the stove, so she tried and move the oil outside onto my apartment’s balcony. While moving the pan a little bit splashed on her hand, resulting in dropping it. The oil spilled onto her right arm/hand, right thigh and close to the entire lower left leg and foot. Thankfully as soon as the oil hit the carpet, the fire went out immediately and no further damage happened, and our dog was completely unharmed. She knocked door to door looking for help and eventually was saved by my downstairs 80yo neighbor, who called me while she got into the shower to manage the pain. \n\nWhen I arrived, I rushed her to the closest emergency room. She was stabilized until she could be transferred to another hospital with a full body burn unit. The only one in the state. She was treated very well by the staff there. Nurses, doctors, therapists, everyone. They communicated great and really helped to keep us as comfortable and at peace as possible. In her words, the only bad part of the stay was the food, but that could be expected, I think. Monday, August 11th was her first procedure to have the dead and damaged skin removed from her arm removed to see if she needed grafts. The doctors ultimately determined grafts would be necessary to all her burns with exception of some small spots from oil splashing on her legs. They started with a \"fake skin\" graft (Allograft) on her arm, and a deep clean of all her wounds. After the procedure, it was the worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Replacing the initial burns as her new 10/10 on the pain scale.\n\nHer second procedure was on August 15th. She had the fake skin removed from her arm, dead tissue removed from her legs, everything deep cleaned again then finally the skin grafts were stapled, with skin being taken from good spots of her thighs and calves. The day after that procedure was the new worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Then they didn't touch any of her wounds for daily cleaning or anything for 4 days. On the 19th, she had all her staples that were holding the grafts in place removed and got her wound care/cleaning (not a deep clean) again. The skin grafts looked pretty cool to be honest. Her arm looked like it was covered in dragon scales. After another 4 days of intense PT exercises and healing, plus some sessions with her PT coach (that I nicknamed Ms. Sunshine) she was doing well enough to go home by August 24th. \n\nNow, thankfully she was fortunate enough to have very good travel insurance through her MasterCard that paid for the trip. It covered up to $150,000 in her medical expenses. By the way, interesting fact, medical expenses covered by travel insurance does NOT count as health insurance. Which was a pain in the ass because we had been dealing with the contracted health insurance company \"AXA\", who struggled to communicate with us and especially the hospital. Adding to all the hassle and confusion and smoke (pun intended), we were struggling/unable to get a solid answer on what they (AXA) were covering, which was very worrisome. When you've been in a state-of-the-art burn unit for 15 days and simply existing in the room cost us over $11,000 a day, she capped out on the $150,000 quickly. IF her insurance actually covers their share and doesn’t weasel out on anything, then the additional costs are one of our last a major issues. \n\nWe still haven't gotten the bill, but we got an estimate with detailed items of $224,400.18 that included medicine, wound care, procedures and the room rate. We were keeping track of that bill almost twice a week but after she was discharged our new estimate also had specific charges for every doctor stacked on. Resulting in a surprise extra sum of $38,553.14. Making the new total expenses $262,953.32 (which is a terrifying prospect). After looking at all the itemized expenses, the only thing that stood out for us (besides the surprise extra charges) was that there was no change in the room price (over $11k) even after we got moved to a different floor, unit, in a room less than half the size and with far less active nursing. \n\nNow, my fiancée and I have decent savings accounts that could help some. But nothing that could cover this potential additional $112,000 in debt. Our savings accounts were supposed to be to help us start a life together, not... this. Aside from the medical expenses her travel insurance covered for her mom to travel here to help take care of her, which has been a huge blessing to both of us. The insurance is also offering to cover both her and her mom’s flights back home to Brazil once she’s recovered enough to deal with airport germs. We simply are overwhelmed and don't know what to do about all this, and we hardly know anything about hospital bills, negotiations or dealing with insurance companies. Plus, the hospital keeps giving us the run around on who to talk to regarding billing or negotiations.\n\nThere's also been a lot of other surprise expenses, all hitting at the exact same time as this accident. It's made our finances even more tight and stressful. This is just overall so difficult to deal with on so many levels, especially when you have no idea the scope of the systems you're dealing with. It's just been a nightmare from start to finish, and it's not even done yet. Please give us an outside view looking in. We're trying to remain calm, but the looming debt gets closer every day. Any relevant experiences, tips, tricks, or advice; it's all welcome. We will also try to answer any questions that are asked. What can we do?\n\nThanks guys, \n\nT & M", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We quickly went from friends to something more—flirting, sexting, daily chats, good morning/good night texts, and even plans to meet in person.\n\nBut recently, she’s gone cold. She ghosted me for five days, gave vague excuses, breadcrumbed me with a half-hearted offer to hang out (which she didn’t follow through on), and then disappeared again. She says she’s overwhelmed—her visa expired, she’s traveling to my country to reset it, and she’s staying with a longtime online friend. I tried to be understanding, but her actions don’t match her words.\n\n\nMy gut says she’s found someone else, maybe someone new, since she didn’t speak highly of her ex. It feels like I’m being kept on ice as a backup plan, especially since she hasn’t blocked me and still has plans to meet up.\nI’ve reflected a lot and realized I never set clear expectations or boundaries. We acted like more than friends, but I never defined what we were. Maybe she was waiting for me to lead, and my lack of assertiveness turned her off. Still, if she had concerns, she could’ve voiced them instead of going silent.\n\nThis was my first romantic connection, so I made mistakes. I didn’t know how often people expect to talk, and I didn’t realize that even a short break in communication could cause anxiety. One night, I didn’t reply because I was tired, and she quadruple-texted me. I didn’t apologize because we weren’t officially anything, but maybe that shift in rhythm made her pull away.\n\nEven though I wasn’t perfect, I always tried—especially when she ghosted. A couple weekends ago, we had a short gaming session (unusual for us), and then she went silent again. 3 days go by and I technically double-texted for the first time, saying I was thinking about her and hoped her week was better. She replied two days later, saying she was busy prepping for her trip. I told her I understood but that the silence hurt. She apologized and said let’s do something what do I want to do. I suggested gaming and catching up, but she brushed it off with a vague excuse and said “another time.” That stung, especially after I just opened up as was vulnerable\n\n\nSince then, it’s been more silence—while she’s still active on Discord. It feels like she’s flaunting it, like she wants me to see she’s ignoring me. It’s hard not to take that personally. She has 2 discords one for PC and one for mobile and as I write this she is sat on a game whilst having discord open on her phone so she can text whoever it is she’s texting.\n\nMy plan now is to mirror her energy. If she comes back, I’ll have the boundaries and expectations conversation. If she’s vague or breadcrumbs again, I’ll ignore untill she says something meaningful, so I can have said conversation. Should I call her out for lying? Or Should I just set the expectations and boundaries? Or both? I fell hard for her, and part of me wants to hold on. But I also know I deserve better than being strung along. If she shows genuine interest and respects my boundaries, maybe we can rebuild. If not, I’ll move on.\nI’m unsure how to start that conversation if she reaches out. If she sends a dry “hey,” it feels weird to jump into something serious. Maybe I should match her tone until she shows real interest, then lay it all out.\n\nSorry for the long post—it’s messy, but I needed to get it out. I’d appreciate any thoughts on where I went wrong, whether I should give her another chance, or just let go.

Flirting, sexting, good morning/night texts, talking all day, had plans to meet IRL blah blah blah\n\n2 months in and she’s gone cold on me. Distant, ghosting me for 5 days, giving vague excuses, breadcrumbing me, said we should do something like hang out probably out of guilt, and then she couldn’t even follow through with that and she went straight back to ghosting for another 3 days. \n\nShe claims she’s so busy, and as she’s going through a big life change, her visas run out where she is living currently and has to come to my country to reset it so she can go back, and she’s staying with an online friend who she’s known for a long time whilst she’s here, so I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt as I can imagine that could be quite overwhelming.\n\nYet her excuses and her actions aren’t aligning. Busy booking flights and getting ready to come, and a day trip out doesn’t account for 5 days of ghosting. \n\nI’ve been monitoring her activity on discord (unhealthy, I know) but I had the feeling that she was “cheating” and it was nagging me, driving me insane. I thought I was just being insecure, but someone who claims there “so busy” spends an awful lot of time being active on discord mobile, constantly popping us as active and going inactive, usually for 2-5 minutes then going off. Which would indicate she’s texting someone on it, just not me. \n\nI’m certain there’s more to this than she’s telling me. My intuition says she’s found someone else, whether it’s someone new, or an ex back in the picture I don’t know for sure, I’m leaning someone new because she seemed really turned off by her ex when we had briefs chat about him, regardless whoever it is she’s not too busy for them, she’s just to busy for me. \n\nShe hasn’t blocked me, but it’s like she’s keeping me on ice as a backup plan or something, as shes coming to this country and we had plans to meet, and I take her around one of the capitals for a day out. Maybe she just thought she could still use me for that as entertainment and a wallet for the day, otherwise if she’s lost interest why hasn’t she just blocked me?\n\nI can’t sit and just point fingers because clearly I went wrong somewhere, else she wouldn’t have lost interest. I’ve done a lot of reflection to figure out where and brutally honest, I never set expectations or boundaries such as exclusivity etc or about where this was going, or what this even is, when I should have much earlier on. Maybe she was waiting for me to lead in this regard but I hadn’t gotten around to it. I wasn’t assertive enough in this regard, so while our behaviour with eachother was highly suggesting more than friends, how entitled can I really feel to be this upset when it’s on me to set these things in place. Maybe this was a turn off for her because it was too ambiguous, which makes sense\n\nAt the same time while it’s the man’s job to do these things, surely she could have voiced these things if they were her concerns? Instead of communicating that she just went cold and moved on to the next guy\n\nIn all honesty, this is the first time I’ve really spoken to a girl romantically so I was bound to make some mistakes, I wasn’t aware of the right timing for these actions, but it was definitely around where things started going cold in hindsight. I didn’t realise the unwritten expectations of talking daily with lots of frequency until I spoke with a friend about it, whose girlfriend said that if he didn’t speak to her for a day then he would assume he was cheating. \n\nThere were times when it was going well and she wouldn’t speak for a couple hours and then apologise for not doing so, which I thought was unnecessary as I’m happy to go lengths without talking as again, my first time really speaking to someone romantically I didn’t know the expectation was so high in terms of constant talking. \n\nAbout a month or so in, I went one evening where I didn’t respond purely because I was a bit tired and I wasn’t sure what to say, she quadruple text me and the next day I didn’t apologise as I didn’t think it was nessecary as we didn’t have a label so i didn’t feel like we owed eachother that. She never called this out and continued like normal but I think things started to get cold from here, maybe this made her feel anxious as our rhythm had been constant before this point. Interestingly it was from here that things slowly started to decrease in terms of our rhythm. I went back to normal after that but she slowly grew distant.\n\nIf this was something that upset her, again I understand now and I should have apologised, but at the same time she could have called it out? For me I’m happy to go hours without speaking I’m not like that, if I feel I don’t have anything to say I don’t like to just talk for the sake of talking you know, but maybe this evening I took of made her feel anxious? Maybe I’m overthinking and this wasn’t the turning point, maybe it was my assertiveness and leading as a whole. \n\nWhile I wasn’t the perfect communicator either, I always tried and put in the effort, especially when she went ghost. \n\n\nThe weekend before last, we had a gaming session on the Sunday, albeit a short one. Normally we would play all day but she breadcrumbed me with a short session for a couple hours. Then she doesn’t text at all for 3 days, despite her being the last to message in the chat, so I decided to “double text” which I’ve never done with her, a message her saying “thinking of you, hope your having a better week than last” as she had some issues that week. No response, only 2 days after she then responds “sorry I’ve been so busy IRL and getting ready to come to X country” so I sent her a message about “I get it’s probably an overwhelming time so I understand, we spent alot of time together before then and a breather probably did us some good, but silence for 5 days was mean.”\n\nShe was super apologetic and said she should have message, what are you down to do? So I said let’s play something and have a catchup. And then she makes an excuse suddenly as to why she can’t do that and said okay let’s do another time trying to play it cool, which felt extremely insensitive on her part as I just put my heart on my sleeve and she just blew me off for something minor. Since then another 3 days have passed and it’s been the same, straight silence.\n\nAnd throughout these periods of silence, she’s been super active on discord. Today she’s been popping up active and inactive pretty consistently for the last 5 hours or so. So she’s 100% not as busy as she claims to be. How can she sit there brazenly showing her status like that and just lie to my face? It’s like she wants me to see it and take the hint, that’s how blatant it is. She will pop up on it 6-12 times an hour, she’s clearly not that busy.\n\nMy plan now is to just return her energy now, and if she comes back then step up for myself and have the boundaries and expectations conversation, and if she complies then I can let her back in. But if she comes back to me with vague responses again and breadcrumbing her I should probably just ignore her. She’s walking over me, and part of that’s my fault here, so I think the middle ground is set those boundaries if she comes back and no more games. And if she can’t then obviously I’ll walk. Because I fell for her pretty hard, and part of me feels I shouldn’t stand for this and walk away now, but the other part of me still wants her, and if she displays enough interest and I can sucessfully set the boundaries and expectations then maybe we can repair this. I’m not sure what the best way would be to have this convo is, obviously once she shows interest again, but at what point? \n\nIf she messages back and gives dry re entries like simple hellos or whatever then it feels weird to just jump in with that. Maybe I should act dry if she comes back and then if she says the right things then I can hit her with that conversation.\n\nthere was a lot of back and forth here, sorry to whoever’s reading I’m not the best at laying out my thoughts in a well constructed manner so it’s a bit chaotic but I hope this is enough info to get some opinions on where I’m at, what I should do, and worst case, advice for next time.

After leaving an abusive relationship, this felt like a dream. He was sweet, supportive, constantly texting, calling - just making me feel safe and appreciated. Our first in-person meeting was amazing. I felt relaxed, happy, and really present.\nSince then, communication has stayed consistent and good overall, but a few things have been bothering me, and I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if they’re red flags:\n1. None of his friends or family know about me. He says they “wouldn’t understand” because we’re long-distance. I’m just his friend for them, no more. \n2. There are no concrete plans for our next visit. Whenever I ask, he just says “I don’t know.” That is strange, because when we first met, he was eager to make it happen ASAP.\n3. He lied to me “for my own good.” It wasn’t a big lie, but it was unnecessary and honestly pretty dumb. Now I feel like I have to be on guard.\n4. No conversations or steps about a future together. No talk about closing the distance, moving, or how we could make that happen. We’re both adults… not students or in our early 20s… so I feel like this should at least be something we start discussing. \nBesides these issues, I feel really happy and comfortable with him. I’m not the kind of person who dates just for fun. I want a real future - a home, a family, one loving partner to share my life with. The distance is the hardest part, and if I could afford to move, I honestly would. But right now, it’s just not financially possible for me.\nI haven’t brought up the topic of moving or money with him because, truthfully, I’m not even sure how serious he is about all of this. I’m also waiting to have this conversation in person, but the uncertainty around when we’ll meet again is making that hard.\nI’m not great at relationships. I’ve made mistakes before, and I’m tired of getting it wrong. I overthink a lot, especially when I don’t fully understand where I stand.

I think there is a lot that you can learn about someone through more typical day to day experiences and it bothers me that we haven’t had much of a chance for that.

I am very set on not leaving where I currently live and have been very clear about that from the beginning of our relationship. She keeps trying to convince me to move to where she lives which has begun to irritate me as I have been very clear from the beginning and has degraded some of my trust as it almost feels like she doesn’t want to leave and she hasn’t been honest with me. This has escalated into a more serious conversation about delaying getting married which has obviously caused some problems. I’m interested in getting other peoples opinions or experiences that may be relevant to this. Am I crazy for not feeling like I can get to know someone fully long distance before getting married.

My girlfriend and I (both 18) just broke up, and I’m struggling to process it because, in so many ways, she was perfect. I know everyone says that about their first love, but our connection was incredible. We went together like mint ice cream and chocolate chip. She was everything I ever wanted in a partner, she was beautiful, funny, kind, extremely intelligent, caring, funny, cute, like if we were getting married tomorrow I'd be so happy.\n\nWe started dating long-distance (I'm in the South, she's in the North) back in January. The first few months were like a magnet. We talked constantly, and the connection was amazing. I even drove up to visit her, and our time together in person was even better.\n\nThe problems started as we got closer to starting college (we're both freshmen at different schools). The dynamic started to feel dry, and I could tell she was pulling away. She finally ended it, and the reasons are completely logical and fair:\n\n* **Long distance is brutal.** She said she wasn't cut out for it anymore.\n* **The next four years would be unfair.** I would be the only one able to visit (her family is strict and took her car), plus they didn't know about me. Meaning we'd see each other maybe one week a year.\n* **We're young.** We don't know where life will take us after college.\n\nThe breakup itself was incredibly mature. There was no fight. We mutually agreed that this would be better, and if we meet up again we'll try and make it work. She then asked for some space and no contact for a while (I think to let the feelings subside Idk though), but I still just wanted to respect her.\n\nBut my heart is having a hard time accepting the logic. I feel like I've lost my soulmate. I don't want another girl; I want my girl. I want to respect her and this decision, but I'm left with this profound feeling of loss, but also a sense of freedom, Idk I was worried cause it just, I can't explain it in words correctly, like our convos got drier as she got busier, and eventually Idk it just, just felt there, but was just that. I think because she was putting a lot of thought into whether she wanted to quit it or not, I think she loves me a lot, it's not like she stopped loving me, and she didn't even know I felt like I was soloing the relationship. It's just weird...\n\nSo, my question for you all is: **How do you stop the feeling of losing someone so perfect you would have been happy with them forever?** How do you let go when the breakup was \"healthy\", but you still miss all those memories you made with thate person? All the mistakes I made, and she forgave, all the hugs, the kisses, the poems I wrote her every anniversary, and our cute things we do like sending reels, doing a mwah as a kiss, always saying goodmorning and goodnight, everytime we said I love you we put a heart underneath it. Even when I was clingy sometimes she just accepted me, and when I felt sad or alone she consulted me, and I'd do the same if she'd open up too. Like how do you move on from that, and the cute nick names, the wedding dresses we looked at, the shows we looked at, the list of names we'd love to give to our kids, choosing the house we wanted and talking about how we'd like? I just don't know how to move on from all of that. Even though we're friends still, I wanna hear her jokes, and ask about her day, and write a poem on our monthly anniversary, and play videogames, and make drawings, I just don't know how to move on from loving someone like that. I really don't want another girl, I had the most perfect girl, and I tried my best, but LDR is limited, and it wouldn't be fair to force her to stay with me, just because of feelings, if she doesn't wanna do LDR, then i have to respect her wishes. \n\nI just would love some advice, what do you do? \n\n**TL;DR:** My (18M) first girlfriend (18F) was perfect for me, but we had a mature, mutual breakup because of the reality of long-distance and starting college. I logically understand why it had to end, but I'm emotionally struggling to let go of the feeling that I lost \"the one.\" How do you move on from a person who felt perfect for you?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

{"id": "u/ChemistCurious6903_250", "user": "u/ChemistCurious6903", "text": "My gf is going to study and work abroad and I’m afraid of losing her\n\nHello, everyone. This is my very first time posting here. I will try to give you as much context as I can, because the situation I find myself in has become extremely complex for me and so mentally difficult and suffocating that I can’t deal with it anymore. I have been depressed for some months now and I am afraid that the worse is yet to come.\n\nOur story goes as follows. I (33m) met this girl (25f) through a dating app at the beginning of this year. I am currently living and working in Italy, though I am Mexican. My life before meeting her was not that bad but not that great either. I have a stable income and an otherwise quite dull life, which I had decided to keep until I decided that I had enough of this life experience and just go back to my country, since I have barely any friends and no family with me right now. One day, out of nowhere, I decided to try some luck changing my location in the dating app, specifically to Morocco. I found this girl, self-described as corporate, leading a quite normal life in her country. We matched and fell for each other almost instantly. There was a time in which we didn’t think too much about the possibilities of first meeting and then eventually closing the gap, since we were having some good time with each other. \n\nHowever, things escalated quickly. We were all over each other for months and it was clear that we were determined to make this work. I would sometimes get very serious when the topic meeting and closing the gap came up, stating that we needed to meet first to see how things went and then decide from there what to do. I remember telling her many times “Please, do not make any life-changing decisions before we meet”, a phrase that would then echo in my mind up until this day. \n\nLast April, I announced to her my intention to go meet her in her country during the summer break and she exploded in excitement. We were continuing with our relationship without any problems, organising video calls, even sleeping on the phone; it truly seemed like a dream. Until something happened.\n\nIn the past, she had expressed a very loose interest in going to France to study for then living and working there, eventually. She told me that those plans were shelved, since she had tried it but for some bureaucratic reasons, her contract (apprenticeship) got cancelled and she was left with a trauma. I thought in the back of my mind that she might still be wondering about that, hence the famous phrase that I have told you before. One day, out of nowhere, she dropped the news: she had decided to go study and work in France.\nIt was one of the worst days of my life. An avalanche of feelings came to me. I knew that I couldn’t tell not to do it, this had been her dream. On the other hand, it made me feel terrible because of several reasons. First, I felt left out since she didn’t even spoke with me about it, she just decided by herself. Second, reaching her would have become extremely difficult since I would have practically no chances of moving there (I do speak the language but getting a company to sponsor the visa is extremely difficult). Third, I admit it, it touched my pride in some way. She is going to be getting a second Masters of 1 year while potentially leading to much better career prospects for her. I am really happy that she could achieve all of this, but I feel that this was a breaking point, with her eventually evolving away from me.\n\nAfter I expressed my feelings, she insisted on trying to pursue a relationship like this, since we were very deep in love with each other. Although I agreed, the damage was done. I suffer from clinical depression episodes and this had triggered one, probably one of the worst I have ever experienced. The relationship dynamics changed. I lost my cool, my mental peace, but tried to make it seem that I was okay. She was fully aware of this and provided me with her support. However, things were slowly and progressively getting worse. Every time I had an update about her process, I would get extremely sad. She applied to a business school in Paris, got admitted right away. Then she searched for apprenticeship positions (she could do this thing of alternating this apprenticeship with university courses and still get her degree after one year) and she didn’t had any difficulty finding one, a very good one in the headquarters of a multinational company in the outskirts of Paris.\nI felt completely crushed, because I felt that I was being left behind in everything, in career, ambition and this relationship. \n\nMy mental health was at an all-time-low. Even though we still loved each other and could spend some really great moments, discussions became more and more frequent, to the point of severely affecting our relationship. I decided that I didn’t want to drag her down and that I needed to accept the reality and proposed to still meet her, just to not have any regrets. Initially I saw this meeting as a potential goodbye, since for me it was getting difficult to accept what she was going to do. Therefore we met a couple of days ago in Morocco.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe me that it was the most amazing time of my life. Right after we met, we felt that we had known each other for years. It truly felt like not only I was with my girlfriend, but also with my soulmate, the one I had been looking for. In her words, that trip “saved our relationship”, since neither of us wanted to end things after what happened. We made another difficult decision: to continue pursuing this relationship even after all of what happened.\n\nHowever, I don’t know how to deal with what’s coming or if will be able to do so. I have some many fears: Will that experience change her? Will she get over me after what she will be living? And you might be wondering, what about closing the gap? This is the most difficult part and one we have discussed again and again and there is no clear answer. We explored all options: her country, my country, but none of those seem to convince her. She wants to take things one step at a time. This means that she will do this one year thing and then she will decide. She told me that if she doesn’t like it, she is likely to follow me, but recently, she admitted that living and working in Paris (or almost in Paris) is a dream to her. She told me that if she does things right, she will get offered the full-time position. Yet again, she affirms that her decision to stay remains in whether she likes the experience or not.\n\nIf I decided to pursue this, I will be in the limbo for at least a year, waiting to know if she likes it or not. I definitely want her to do this, she tells me that she wants to live this life for a while but also that she doesn’t want to lose me. The uncertainty of this is killing me. My fears are all eating me up. I am now having therapy sessions and will start getting on antidepressants to cope with all of this. I do believe that this woman is worth it, she is everything I had dreamed of, but I’m afraid she won’t be the same, that she will evolve away from me, that she will become unreachable and that this will be the tragic end of a love story that could have been perfect.\n\nIf you have made it all the way here, I appreciate your time and your attention.\nPlease let me know your thoughts.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We are each others first partner. We have had a pretty rocky relationship since the start where I had to cry and convince him to change his patterns as they were mentally exhausting me. Some of the problems we had in the past were :\n\n1- him entertaining female friends I feel uncomfortable with ( and no i do not mean everyone just 2)\n\n2- him calling other girls/friends “hot” or like checking them out or commenting “🔥🔥🔥” on their post.\n\n3- using my traumas against me as a joke (relative being inappropriate and BD) … he said it was a mistake and apologised profusely.\n\n4- never writing me letters or getting flowers etc even on special occasions like anniversary and birthday.(he did say he couldn’t afford at that time and is a forgetful person)\n\n5-he’s not traditionally masc with me like I don’t expect him to stand up for me ever or stuff (he says hes scared but he has often picked up fights with teachers/cab drivers)\n\n6-he has been angry at me and all for being late at times and honestly sitting in a car with him has always been so stressful for me because he always never talks , looks anxious and makes it look like a burden to drop me home. I get that when youre driving but even when we are in a cab it’s always very weird.\n\n7- We are from a religious background so we haven’t had sex but the occasional slip up like making out and bj has occurred. He’s always very active while sexting ans talks about it to do irl and even initiates at time but then blames me for it.\n\nThese are just some of the primary reasons of arguments in our relationship but personally in the past two years my mental health did get worse and I have been insecure and in self doubt. Also all the blaming and all made my relationship with intimacy really weird.\n\nFast forward now, we are in the same city but diff colleges and meet once in every 2 weeks. Tbh it hasnt been good really, I always feel like I’m too excited to meet him when he isn’t. Plus the whole blaming for trying to kiss him and all when he takes my hands to his dick has messed up a lot on me. It’s selfish to think but ever since I have been away from him I have gotten sm better. I like myself more and have had a boost in confidence and all. All of this also made me realise how maybe I was too young to commit and maybe deserve better ? I havent really had any friends until recently and im too embarrassed to tell them the whole thing because well it is and ik for a fact they will ask me to dump him because I did once slipped up a little and esp after meeting him they weren’t big fans or smth.\n\nBut all of this is very conflicting now since he has changed. Like fr. He doesn’t entertain anyone, he is eager to get me flowers and other stuff, he doesn’t get mad when I’m late or smth. But idky every-time I meet him something happens that triggers everything else and it’s so weird. And today the reason why im writing this is because we had a thunderstorm in our city which got pretty bad to the point of roads being flooded. In this situation him and his another friend dropped one of their female friends (I really like this girl so yes it has no to do with her). She was having anxiety and all as their cab was also getting flooded and she lives in the same area as me. He came home and told me ans I was obviously worried for their safety and all but then he mentioned how he kept on yapping about random stuff , his family and all to her so that she doesn’t feel anxious and all.\n\nnormally it wasn’t a problem and I was really proud of him too. But I couldn’t help but think that 2 months ago when we met in similar conditions he was so awkward and weird w me. He didn’t talk to me, made it seem like the biggest chore ever ans I was honestly really scared to do quite litr say or do anything sitting beside him. So I just felt really jealous that oh maybe If I wasn’t as strong headed and like yk maybe if I were a damsel in distress etc I would be able to bring that side of him? And this spiraled and I felt so enraged idky but yeah this was very weird. I have pcos so I have been trying to stay calm and all but this was like idk so weird. Idk what to do. He has changed but so have I ig.\n\nTL;DR: Bf of 2 years did smth unintentionally to trigger past grudges and trauma but he has changed for the better. Regardless I have started to feel like I deserve better and I don’t know if it’s the LDR effect. Please give tips on how to stay calm and heal.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He couldn't move to me because his father is alone and elderly and his brother (35m) has a bowel disease. Fair enough, so I moved. But now I'm starting to feel a lot of resentment. My bf and his bro live together and have done that for years. Totally understand that he wants to be in the same city as them, but my moral dilemma is that I ultimately want to to have a future where we're living together and having our own life. My current living situation is less than ideal in (sharehouse I'm not vibing) and I left my wonderful life/friendships and standard/way of life to pursue this relationship. I'm in mourning about my old life. My bf wants me to move in with him and his bro, but when I try to explain that it feels weird he doesn't get it. He's been lowkey angry at me in the past and accused me of asking him to abandon his ill brother. He says he needs to support his bro emotionally and financially as his bro studies full time and doesnt work. I don't know where to go from here, I'm not happy where I am and the only solution he's prepared to give me is one where I move in with them and we make it work. The standard of cleanliness is way below what I'm used to and I can already feel resentment and icked out vibes from it. It feels like he can't see my point of view. When I ask him about the future it feels so convoluted. Like, are you just going to make me compromise and wait for the rest of my life? I feel like the way he engages with me subtly says he thinks im turning my nose up like a snob. He says that all I do is catastrophize n complain since moving here and that I treat him like he's just a pain in my side. I think its true, Im feeling resentful but i wouldn't feel like this as much if there was a bit more compromise or effort to at least understand where I'm coming from, not just say you understand and thats the end of the convo. So, is it valid that I feel uncomfortable about it all? I don't want to get between family and cause distress but I need to think about my own happiness too. They're both kind people, which makes me feel like even more of a b*tch. What the hell do I do????!?!?!? We are so compatible in a soul way, logistically and pratically so incompatible. But he doesn't feel that way. But I think its cause he's not compromising anything.\n\nTLDR: bf wants me to move in with him and his brother, but i feel uncomfortable about it.

Wednesday came around she felt really bad about how reacted told me she’s sorry and didn’t mean to make me cry if I did cry at all and she took responsibility so did I and she said she’s happy we can talk again. Thursday she told me she’s still pretty sick and can’t talk because she’s sick I was like ok that’s fine I get it but I might’ve been little too spammy when I shouldn’t have been. Friday same thing didn’t talk at all she was still sick and than Saturday I asked if she wanted us to last forever and than she said yes she loves me and that she wants us to work out and last forever and I really want us to last forever too. Yesterday I asked her again and she said she starting to have doubts but she does want work on it. She been little off recently usually gets this way if she in pain or sick or if I get really annoying. I guess I been too spammy and way too annoying for her to handle and today I asked if she still loves me if we’re going be fine she got mad asking why do I keep asking that and she said I’m way to anxious all the time I need calm down as she said in the past she feels like she my therapist more than my girlfriend. I tell her I’m trying to change she said I say it but she doesn’t see it at all I tried asking her what does she want me to do so I know what to do to be a better boyfriend. She said stop asking her what I need to do I should know it by now. Then she said everything I’m doing is pissing her off than she snapped at me for being in a group chat with a dude who was very Nazi like and racist and Islamophobia I stayed for my other friends there but I did feel little strange being there. She called me a Nazi for that and was very upset at me asking her if she had Covid as she said I’m being racist to her because she’s Asian. She mad at me for voting more conservatively at one point in time I’m not really conservative anymore though. She told me she started to regret even being associated with the likes of me for the people I talk to. I wanted confront them she wouldn’t let me saying let them be them as that’s how they are. And she pissed I use to tell them our relationship issues. So what I did was I left all them group chats expecting mine I kicked people out and added better and newer people in and I been more open about how I feel politically and myself and trying show I love everyone she in there too I did get very spammy with her today out of anxiety and she hates when I send messages like spam them and then delete them and I did promise her I would stop doing that she probably won’t believe me.

Then we both were in complete silence since I was back to high school and studies. Days and months have passed to the day in November where I saw him on Twitter and message him, hoping that he will reply back. To my surprise and happiness, the next day he has replied to my texts. And our conversation, calls have began from that day onwards… It was indeed LDR but it was really hard, sometimes sad. We did this for 10 years and it was full of happiness, tears, online dates, online movie dates, dinner dates. I got caught by my parents many times but I always tried to keep up the relationship with him even though it was very hard.

It was as if we were just calling like we would normally, but being face to face.\n\nIt was a 2 week trip, we played ‘house’ together, went on dates every night, and shared some extremely intimate moments that i’ve never ever experienced before. \n\nEvery day was thrilling, affectionate, and are memories I will never forget. Sure, we had some bickering or disagreements sometimes, but I feel like it was normal as we were just getting used to being with eachother physicially, and witnessing new mannerisms. Being with my girlfriend physicially felt like I’d been with them for years, which was so reassuring to something so different like LDR.\n\nI’m going to see them again in 3 weeks for their birthday, and then a really long trip at the end of the year! We’ve been calling and texting nonstop, even though we both live very busy lives. I miss them everyday, and love them with all my heart. It’s also so amazing to feel that constant love and effort from someone so far away ❤️.\n\nI know its sort of a weird post, but if it gives anyone hope about actually meeting up with their LDR partner, that makes me happy 😊.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

My partner really admired her art and would get very excited whenever she appeared in chat, similar to how she used to be with me in our honeymoon phase (which she’s told me is now over, something that stung me) \n\nI know my partner is not the type to cheat so I have trust in that, but seeing a reminder of a version of her towards someone else I long for again stings in its own way.\n\nMeanwhile, I’ve been stuck in art block, and I notice she isn’t as enthusiastic with me in casual conversations anymore. \n\n\nThese days, our chats are much less frequent and casual, some days we only exchange a few words to each other- but we’re still there for each other emotionally.

We’ve spent the past few years going back and forth between the US and Spain, meeting each other’s families, and even moving my cat to Spain. Then I got really sick, and he stepped up in every way—taking care of me through hospital stays, feeding me, even dealing with bedpans. After everything, we’ve decided to get married so we can finally be in the same place for good. I am open to any questions.\n\n\n-\nI saw a post earlier where someone was bashing long-distance relationships, saying they only ever saw people struggling. So, I wanted to share my story—one with a happy ending. It’s long, but I wanted to share everything.\n\nI (23F) met my partner (27M) on an app in 2021—the day after my 20th birthday. Neither of us was looking for a relationship; we just wanted someone to “chat” with. But we were instantly smitten. We texted all day, called for hours whenever we could, and basically became each other’s favorite part of the day. I’ve always fallen fast, but I never expected anyone to stay. At the time, I had a lot of unprocessed trauma, but he never left—always kind, attentive, and genuinely interested in whatever I had to say.\n\nAbout 6 months later, he flew from Spain to visit me in the US for 2 weeks. We went to NYC, he met my family and friends, and he saw a bit of my “crazy.” It was heartbreaking when he left, but it made us certain we wanted to be together. He was hesitant about monogamy at first, but a month later, we made it official.\n\nSix months after his visit, I went to Spain for 2 weeks. I met his friends, his family, and his incredibly welcoming community. His parents even took us on a trip to Sevilla to show me all the history.\n\nWhen I got home, things took a turn. I’d contracted a bacterial infection in Spain that went undiagnosed for 8 months. My family thought I’d gotten sick from heartbreak (which was… infuriating). In October, he came back to the US for 3 months. My health was declining, so he took on a caregiving role while also becoming close to my family. When he left right before Christmas, I went with him to Spain, got medical treatment there, and lived with him and his parents for 3 months. My health was rough, but our relationship only grew stronger.\n\nWe decided to close the distance. The plan was for me to go home for a few months, then return to Spain to work on a visa. I had even brought my cat to live with his parents so she was already there. When I returned to Spain, we planned to move into our own apartment (and got permission for my cat). Having our own space gave me so much hope.\n\nThen things crashed. I became severely ill—bedbound, in and out of the hospital. He had to feed me, manage bedpans, and navigate a small-town hospital that didn’t know what to do with me. My mom flew in for a month to help get me home. Through it all, he never left my side, spending every night on a terrible cot at the hospital, stroking my face because it was the only place I could handle touch, and telling me things would get better.\n\nI made it back to my parents’ house in the US in November 2024. I haven’t been healthy enough to travel since, so he’s been flying here every 2–3 months to visit. We keep setting goals for me to return, but I keep missing them.\n\nSo… we made a different decision. My goal is to go back in December, but if I can’t, we’ve decided to get married so he can stay here. Not the big proposal and wedding I dreamed of (that will come later when I’m healthier), but something simple now—gold bands, a casual white dress, his mom flying in when we sign the papers. The process is long: fiancé visa approval takes 6–9 months, then marriage, then his green card.\n\nOne of the things that makes this feel so real and special is how our families have become one. My parents love him, his parents love me, and everyone has been completely supportive of our relationship and our decision to get married. When he visits the US, my mom treats him like a son, and when I’m in Spain, his parents treat me like a daughter. They’ve been there for us through every challenge—cheering us on, sitting with me in hospitals, and helping us figure out how to make the distance work. It’s rare in a long-distance relationship to have both sides fully in it, but ours are—and that support has made all the difference.\n\nOur story isn’t over yet, but I do see it as a happy ending. I have the most kind, wonderful human I’ve ever known—someone who’s stayed when most would have left. In the chronic illness community, it’s rare to have someone not just stick by you, but do everything possible to make your life better. And soon, I’ll get to call him my husband.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I asked him what if his parents are not saying/doing anything for now but after Japan they ask him to break up with me? This was his response:\n\n“That's not gonna happen also even if it did im 31 what are they gonna do”\n\nHow do I even handle the situation? I feel sad thinking about it because I’ve dealt with ex’s parents before who disliked me for unknown reasons and that made me miserable. I don’t wanna be in the same situation again but at the same time, I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to give up on him just because of that.

As time goes by, the cracks started to show. He’s a dismissive-avoidant person that is so self-centered, and I am an anxiously-attached person who had trauma from being cheated on years ago; a dynamic that didn’t go well together. I am not trying to wash my hands here because I know my attachment played a role here too; I kept giving more while receiving less.\n\nI know that you don’t use reddit or maybe in the future you might, I just want to say something since I am now doing a no contact with you. This is my closure to a relationship that was bound to fail from the start.\n\nBubby, I loved you. It was honestly a rocky yet fun relationship that I had with you. The different cultural perspective made me want to learn the world more and that’s what I am grateful for. I will be more honest here, but as you grow more experiences in life, I hope and pray that you fix your attachment and your character. I hated how you always get mug and plate for breakfast, while there’s me, sitting beside you, watching you eat by yourself. I know you did your best and I appreciate you for it, but you’re really inconsiderate and self-centered. And yes, you cheated behind my back when I already set boundaries with the dynamic that you and R had together. It’s not a you&her type of thing, I am your girlfriend, it should’ve been an us thing. You disrespected me a lot. I pray that you find peace in your heart and be healed from the pain that your parents gave you.\n\nI took the love that I thought that I deserved.

A couple of months ago, we discussed moving in together by the end of this year. I suggested he move down to where I am because I want to stay close to my son. I’ve tried talking to lawyers about the possibility of me taking him with me as a move-away case, but they didn’t seem optimistic about it. That’s why we agreed on him moving down. He’s already lived there for half of his life and rents a space with his sister and her husband. They’re about to have a baby, and now he feels pressured to stay longer to help out his sister. He pays half of all the bills there. I understand he wants to continue helping and how much of a big change it will be for him. But I can’t help but wonder where that puts our relationship.\n\nTo make matters worse, he lives in a tiny space—a dorm-like house in the backyard (thankfully, he at least has a bathroom). The company he works for is family-owned, so he doesn’t get any benefits, just a high pay raise. That’s good for now, but I encourage him to look out for himself and his career growth.\n\nEither way, it’s going to be a struggle or a sacrifice.

We talked for about a week on the app before he was in town for work and met in person. Our first date was picture perfect and we had instant chemistry - it was actually how crazy how well we got along and what being with eachother felt like.\n\nHowever, after he went home, he started to distance himself from me. We talked a bit about it and basically he had originally intended to move out my way within the next 12 months but because of family matters (one of his parents is in end stage heart failure), he couldn't bring himself to do it since he is very close with this parent and the only sibling that lives nearby and who can take care of them. He told me he didn't want to do a long distance relationship either because he had a poor experience/rejection the last time he was in one (which was relatively recently). This was something he was upfront with at the start and it basically hinged on him moving out my way from the get go so this wasn't a surprise to me.\n\nI was really upset that we couldn't pursue our original \"plan\" on how we'd get together but we agreed that we'd keep talking/seeing eachother casually irl without any expectations in the meantime. I will also say that he is being genuine - we have a lot of overlapping mutual friends since we work in the same industry (we found that out after we matched on the app) and they've had nothing but good things to say about him as a person.\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to navigate a relationship/situationship like this. I don't want to be told \"just walk away\". I want genuine advice on what to expect, how to communicate, and if anyone else has ever been in a similar boat.

I’d like to keep specific details anonymous, but me and my ex were together for a year with a 5000 mile distance, having made multiple visits. We’ve been broken up for a month as of today. A couple of weeks before the break up she’d asked me for a break, and I told her there were no breaks. A couple of weeks later, she blindsided me, by taking advantage of the fact that I was always sexually open. I think I might’ve been in so much denial I just didn’t think about how this might’ve had something to do with how she’d been acting lately. This guy she fucked wasn’t just “a random guy” she nuked every boundary I’d set, labeled me controlling, downplayed all of the effort I’d ever made for her that she’ll more than likely never see met in another person. Though I really didn’t want to, I broke up with her because instead of coming home from work the next night and talking things out like she said she would, she went to spend the night at his house again. She told me the flowers I’d sent her a week prior felt like I was “buying her love” and I’ll honestly never forget that. She made me the bad person for buying her flowers in the first place, that they reminded her that I’m not really there. She could have cared less to see the true reality considering the fact I had already purchased ANOTHER plane ticket to come back and see her in just a couple of months.\n\nI had my own personal unresolved issues going into the relationship that certainly affected some things, but as someone who responds to pressure instead of doing the right thing and communicating her feelings, and working through things as true family should, she talked to friends instead of me. Friends who hated me in the first place out of jealousy, I’d always been quite suspicious these friends hated me but she’d always find a way to make it sound like they were supportive when only in the very end, she finally admitted they wanted her to dump me since day one of her talking to them again which was about 6 months ago now. In all honesty she sabotaged the relationship the moment she didn’t cut these friends off who never respected our relationship in the first place. From everything I gathered she was peer pressured by a specific friend into talking to this new guy behind my back, convinced she wasn’t a bad person for it knowing damn well in reality how evil it was doing this to me. Over the final month of our relationship, my paranoia grew more and more and my anxious attachment had been more out of control than it had ever been because I knew something was off. She’d constantly spend less and less time on FaceTime and the time left she would spend with me would often be her telling me how much she’s hurting and that she needs something now because she couldn’t wait any longer. One time it got so bad that I busted out crying, and I told her if you want out then I get it but you need to tell me because I feel like I’m hurting you by keeping you in this relationship. She acted as if that wasn’t at all what she tried to say, she said “I had no idea I was making you feel this way” knowing damn well my reaction made her guilt catch up to her in the moment, might’ve even considered the fact my replacement wasn’t solid enough to monkey branch to yet.\n\nI’m not sure when or if she’ll ever fully understand what she did here, her family was beyond disappointed in her, and my family now hates her to death too. I originally lied to my family when we broke up telling them “we simply couldn’t do long distance anymore” because I loved her so much didn’t want my family having a bad image of her and she said the same thing to hers. But she decided to post this new guy on her instagram the next day and that’s when everyone saw what really happened including her own family. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE saw her differently after that, but I guess that’s because both families watched as I actively put in an endless amount of effort for the year we were together, only for her to start hanging out with these piece of shit friends that didn’t respect me, multiple days a week until she finally fed into them labeling me as a control freak. Decided to start agreeing with them and telling them our issues instead of communicating with me. For the first visit, I signed my final contract with a company I had a great reputation with, she’d never seen anyone suddenly generate this large of an amount of money, but it was the last time I’d be doing that because it wasn’t a stable way to guarantee plans see through. I always told her that through out my life I’d learned that life can actually be magical and that instead of questioning how this was possible, that it’s important to take in that it was actually happening because we both believed hard enough. For the second visit where she came to me, I worked my fucking ass off, saving up for her travel expenses, my family even put together some money to help with it too. Normally, I would’ve expected her to pay for expenses, but she’d been fired from her job, and we’d already planned when this second trip would happen and I was set, I cut her some slack and got to work. I always used the word adventures to label our trips where we’d fly half way across the world to be together, only for her to now reuse that word with this new guy after we broke up, to her an adventure is now taking the long way home from the store and driving super fast and what we experienced together was nothing more than some lousy trips.\n\nI always wonder the day she’ll truly face the reality of her behavior towards me, but right now she’s feeding into what her shit friends and this new guy say about me because she’s a fucking pussy, and I’m gone for good this time. I blocked her on everything after she blocked me so she couldn’t just unblock me AGAIN with a fake apology, only to lead me on for a week before deciding to pick the easier, weaker option. In a year I’ll be living the future we planned together, only it’ll be on my own, or maybe with someone new. \n\nAt some point I needed to stop stalking her social media. I realized that I’d see what she’d post and it would just make me go buy another 5th of gray goose to slam that day. It’s been a little over a week now since I gave into the temptation of looking, but right now I have to go back to work to finish paying off a loan for a plane ticket I sadly won’t be using. I’ve had a great friend of mine who started going to the gym with me regularly which has been very helpful and I’m not sure if he even knows how much it’s meant to me. I’m still buying a 6 pack every couple of days but I’ve completely cut off my consumption of liquor.\n\nShe was much younger than me and early into adulthood which meant immaturity. I think part of me will always be understanding of her actions despite the fact that I didn’t behave this way when I was at her stage in life, and no matter how much I want to, I can’t find it in myself to feel actual hatred towards her despite how I was treated in the end. \n\nOn a final note, as I navigated through all of my feelings and emotions, I had to create my own unique closure to this evil betrayal. In order to find closure, I made an agreement with myself. She’s welcome to come back later on down the road, but on the condition that she must work hard, and pay for her own traveling expenses this time, and I will not be making the first visit again. Some of you may think “well that’s fucking stupid, how does that give you closure?” In all honesty, I feel comfortable moving on accepting the fact that upon putting this condition on her, either 1 year from now or 10 years from now, she simply wouldn’t be willing to reciprocate the effort that I once put in for her. I’m moving on with the understanding that she will never be the person I believed in upon randomly meeting her online on a random night over a year ago.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I (m21) and my girlfriend (f20) have been together for almost two years now. We recently started long distance about two months ago and things have been pretty smooth for the most part. This last week, though, was super tough for the both of us. I’m a volunteer firefighter who had a particularly bad call and had some strong emotions after it. In fact, I’m wondering if it’s still something I want to pursue. She’s a psych major and just finished up a summer camp for kids with autism, and it’s probably one of the hardest things she’s ever done. We barely spoke for most of the days she was there, but always made time to have a quick phone call. She’s barely had any alone time and is a person who needs it. On Tuesday, we got into our first fight over the phone which we smoothed over and, even talked about some new boundaries. I was really proud of us. Thursday, I felt like tensions were still high so we took the night to kind of focus on ourselves and it seemed to work fine, but the last two days then, we haven’t been able to talk at all. Today, was even harder. Her kids left and she spent most of the day cleaning and dealing with coworkers. I asked how she was and just responded that she’s doing ok. She ended up getting drunk with some girls and told me she was safe and having a good time, which is awesome, but then I stopped hearing from her. I assume she just fell asleep. I guess I’m just bummed cause I miss her and was looking forward to a conversation. It also would’ve been nice to know beforehand what her plans were so I wasn’t waiting for a call, but I know she didn’t mean anything by it. Do I sound dumb? How do we get back on track?

We lost contact during COVID for about 4-5 years, but started reconnecting recently, and we've now been dating for almost 3 months. Things were great at first, barely any arguments or problems. But lately, things have been getting harder, especially with both of our mental health struggles.\n\nI have BPD, depression, hearing loss, and recently came out of an academic burnout. He has depression, ADHD, insomnia, and hypersomnia (yes, somehow both). Recently, he's been sleeping worse, if sleeping at all, and I've been spiralling more into depression, which also makes my BPD worse.\n\nToday, while we were on a call, I couldn't hear what he said (this happens often), so I asked him to repeat himself. As usual, he just replies with \"oh, nothing.\" I tried pushing for an answer, but he said, \"sunny day outside, isn't it?\" something he often says instead of repeating himself.\n\nI understand it must be exhausting for him to repeat himself multiple times a day, and I really do try to focus when he speaks. But with my hearing loss and online calls, sometimes I just don't catch it. Today, I got frustrated and muted myself. He asked why, and I said, \"Well, talking isn't worth it, right? Since I can't hear you anyway and you won't repeat yourself.\" He responded, \"Yup, talking ain't worth it then.\" Since then, we've basically been ignoring each other.\n\nI'm not great at verbally expressing my feelings, so I often write little stories to explain how I feel, I did that today and send it to him. He read it but didn't reply. He hasn't slept in over 24 hours, so I get that he's tired, but I can't help being scared that this is the beginning of the end of our relationship. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him.\n\nAnother ting: I'm not good with silence because my thoughts spiral, so sometimes I ask him to start a conversation or just talk to me. He always says, \"I'm not a yapper,\" which I understand, but it feels like he NEVER initiates conversations. Sometimes it just feels like he isn't willing to fight for me or try to make me stay.\n\nI know he just came out of a toxic relationship where he was constantly told he was wrong and blocked multiple times a day. And that really did a number on him. We promised never to block eachother, and we've kept that promise. But still... am I overthinking because of my mental health, or is this actually the start of the end?\n\nTL;DR: Dating my boyfriend for 3 months after reconnecting from years apart. We both struggle with mental health. Today, I got frustrated because he wouldn’t repeat himself on a call (I have hearing loss), and now we’re ignoring each other. He rarely starts conversations and I’m scared he’s not willing to fight for me.

TLTR, but its for better context.\n\nI (26M) have been in a relationship with my current girl (21F) for 2 yrs now but recently it seems like she’s drawing back. She was all lovey dovey, sending poems, random selfies, snaps and video flashes all along until recently. \n\nApparently  I got an opportunity to work abroad and I couldn’t let that slide. I told her we shud breakup bcos I dont do LDR but she insisted that we dont have to break up and promised to wait for me, I thought why not and we kept the ball rolling. \n\nI left for the abroad work just weeks after our first anniversary and everything was on smoothly until the last 3 months I notice she’s drawing back on most of the thigh she would do to keep things interesting snc its a LDR, it’s like she’s second guessing. It even gets worse day by day because I told her my contract will be extended and I wont be back soon as she expected. (The initial contract was 1yr but it got extended by a yr)\n\nAt one point on video call she told me, and I quote “I love the way you love me now unlike before when you used to act ‘gangster’. I asked what do you mean I used to act gangster- she responded with “ when you were here you acted like you never cared about me, always did things your way and had other girls having your attention while I did everything for you”. Then it dawned on me that it’s the ‘gangster’ version she wanted to please and love.   \n\nI notice my flaw is that I may have given her too much attention (like watering a flower to death) to appoint that she confirms that she likes the way I love her now, unlike the time I was ‘gangster-like’. But in my opinion, I thought the LDR would be kept alive by consistent communication and attending to her emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, efforts were mutual snc she had her ways of spicing things up despite the distance. Some time back, her mother came across our chats and she scolded her for the naughty chats, videos and pics she was sending to me. She actually says she was told to stop contacting me but we’ve been in contact every day. Apparently she feels shy and ashamed of spicing things up because of the incident. \n\nOff late the conversations are drying up, and the efforts look forced. And here is where I need your advice:\n1. What girl physcology is this- she does it all for the ‘gangster version’ but draws back when the ‘lover version’ takes over? How can I reverse the situation to the ‘gangster version’ whilst in a LDR?\n2. Is there away to save this? That’s get back her attention and keep things interesting or should I just observe and let things hit the wall?( that’s what it looks like)", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She's also going to visit family in colombia there. After her gap year, she's going to come back to my country (or a neighboring country close to me) to study.\n\nWe've agreed to long distance, as were kind of used to it (lived 3 hours away, met 1-2x a month for a period of 8 months before). We're 3 weeks in now. \n\nWe've promised and are planning to meet up during this year - i plan to come to brazil at least once, but as i'm starting uni, it can't be a long duration of time there. \n\nShe's 19 and i'm her first partner for everything. I'm 21 and had a couple partners prior, so i now know what i like and don't like - and i really like her. I see a fantastic future with her in it. I really do love her, but i can't help but also be afraid that my time with her has always been limited. Because for her, her situation is different - she's in her prime, beautiful as hell, and hasn't explored other sexual partners yet. \n\nWe are in love and have been talking about our future together, are planning future trips and so on, and she's set to come back to my country in a year. The future is on paper looking really bright and i look forward to it so much.\n\nBut i'm so scared this LDR situation is gonna ruin our plans and dreams for the future. I'm scared of becoming a ghost. An annoying notification she has to answer. A routine call. A figment of her imagination that she only vaguely remembers from our past memories together. A name that doesn't invoke any feelings in her. A \"don't worry about him\". Scared of becoming \"the backup\". Scared of becoming the second choice. \n\nBecase our physical connection isn't there anymore. No oxytocin or hormones to physically remind our minds and bodies of the love we share for each other. No direct real-life eye contact to look into each others hearts. No affection apart from the vibrations and light emitted by our phones and digital devices.\n\nI'm scared she'll fall into the trap of the new, seductive, thrilling and *real* offers she'll be given by guys she meets during her gap year. They can provide so easily, what she so desparately will miss from me - physical intimacy. The simplest of all. And that is where i suspect she'll fall in.\n\nAlso, brazil has Carnival in february, and i'm pretty sure i won't be able to be there with her. She has already said to me she wants to attend. In the past she has also said that she has kissed a ton of people at past Carnivals. In this case it is the nature of Carnival and i would maybe still take her back if it doesn't go beyond that, but it is still a big threat to our relationship. I'll be stuck here in front of a screen studying whilst she's out at the #1 place people dance on- and kiss each other. \nI already see the end date of our relationship written above my head, serving as a reminder of how i won't be able to provide enough love to keep her this year, and how she's young, beautiful and still wants to take advantage of that.\n\nI don't blame her. I think what all this is about, is that i, myself, if i was a 19 year old woman who only had one partner, wouldn't lock myself in a relationship already. I would explore the options out there, and then maybe come back if i really liked that partner (me in this case).\n\nI feel a dark space forming in my mind - a space of dread, heartbreak, emotional confusion, and lack of hope. And biggest of all, a big timer, counting down the days until we eventually break up because she wants to get out there \"on the market\". It feels horrible. \n\nMy question is - what should i do? Should i talk to her? What can i do to calm my impending feelings of heartbreak and doom down. And if she really wants to kiss and go crazy at carnival, why shouldn't we just break up now?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

(18 Portugal) Feeling lost and overwhelmed\n\nI’m an 18 year old woman, and I’m still finishing my last year of school after repeating one. I’ve done internships and tried to figure out what I want, but honestly, I don’t want to go to university.\n\nI don’t have a girlfriend, but I recently met someone special. The distance between us is really hard, about 3 hours apart. I live in a small town with barely any public transport, and I don’t have a car yet. I’m learning to drive, but it’s been tough, and honestly, sometimes I just lose motivation.\n\nDuring the summer holidays, which are 3 months long, I get to spend that time with her, and those months feel like the only time the distance disappears. But when school ends and I start working, I don’t know how to manage everything. How do people do it? How do you keep a relationship alive while juggling work, travel, and limited time?\n\nI just want the distance to end. I want to be able to spend months with her, build a life together, find a job, and a home near her. But it feels so far away and so hard to make that happen.\n\nSometimes I feel so lost and overwhelmed, like I’m stuck between two worlds and not really living fully in either.

I scrolled for an hour straight, looking back at our messages. Before we dated he created this entire personal that he was born in Sao Paul, his parents were divorced so he lived in 2 states and would come to my state every holiday, AND that he currently played basketball. He has the most AMAZING parents who have been married for decades and looks up to their relationship, he stopped playing basketball a year before I met him but he knew my type was basketball players, and he was NOT born in Sao Paul or even CLOSE, he just looks up to their soccer players.\n\nWe’ve been planning the next time I see him with his parents since our first meeting last month, it was great. Yet, I feel deceived into believing that in the early stages, he would see me very soon when in reality, he was a completely different person! He lied about his literal upbringing, hobbies, and most importantly where he lived so I could have hope to see him soon. He'd tell me, “Maybe I can come next week” “My mom says Christmas she’ll be accepting of me to go and see my dad where you are the whole summer” “I’m sorry she said no, something’s going on with my dad”. I always had this weird feeling whenever he'd say things that didn't match up, but he denied it. \n\nI want to talk to him but don't know how.

When we started dating, I was still in the process of moving on from my toxic ex. I didn’t expect a relationship, but we just clicked. I felt understood and seen by him, and he has helped me to love and believe in myself. I’m young, yes I know, but I feel like I’ve met the love of my life. \n\nA few months ago, maybe 4 months into our relationship - he told me that he had applied for school in September. So of course I was happy and excited for him. Then he told me that it was going to be in another province. Then it hit me. I remember he told me that he wouldn’t do long distance. I got upset. Not because he was going away and pursuing his dream, but because he didn’t consider me in his future. I know I only met the guy. I know. But sometimes, you just know you know? \n\nI remember that conversation ending with me telling him that I’m not the one to hold him back. I’m his biggest supporter. But of course, I want him to put in the same effort as I will. Mind you, it’s a $60 plane ride and 1 hour time difference. So I really don’t see the big issue. I know I will try my best to love and support him. \nAt the end, we both agreed to make it work and try when the time comes. \n\nThen this is where it gets complicated. He was very busy with work and pre-production for his movie that he barely had time for me. I had no problems with it of course because he kept constant communication. But I guess he started thinking like if he’s like this now, how can he treat me well when we’re thousands of kilometres apart? Then he got the news that he was admitted into the school. He didn’t tell me until a week later and after I brought it up. \n\nFor some reason, he has convinced himself that the relationship will turn sour and may even resent me. He’s always been the type of guy to go through things on his own. His parents did LDR but didn’t survive. His father was absent and they only talked on the phone. His parents made promises to each other but didn’t keep it. But I’m here trying to tell him that we are not his parents. We can be our own. We can choose to love each other. It’s a choice.\n\nHowever with his fear… He said that we “have” to breakup.\n\nI don’t think we “have” to. I’m disappointed that he’s letting the fear decide. He said that we did try “ldr” when he was busy with pre production. AND IM SO CONFUSED BECAUSE HE WAS STILL HERE SO HOW WAS THAT TRYING??? \n\nI don’t know… \n\nPlease help me. Please give me advice.

At first they were hesitant because of the distant but agreed after that, we never really gave it a label tho.

It's been two months since we reconnected, and most of it has been this person saying it's hard for them to trust I won't leave again, but I tried to reassured them that I actually wanted to try again. They also said at some point that they're afraid of losing their independence. Still like a week ago I asked if they were open to love with me, wanted something serious, committed and lasting and they said yes to both.\n\n\nNow the problem is the inconsistency. Sometimes they're very present and then they just kinda dissapear. This week they're very stressed about something going on with their family. I understand and respect that, but the problem is again, that they would rather prioritize hobbies and their friends instead of me, I want to be there for them, but I don't feel like this person includes me or wants me around sometimes.

My heart has been yanked and trampled on..\n\nAfter 3 years of LDR and 4 months of LDM (Marriage) my wife told me and I quote \n\n“You don't understand my point of view. Yes, I don't feel anything, all I feel is emptiness. In fact, I feel like I don't need a man or a companion because I can do it all by myself. There's no difference between having a partner or not for me. In the end, I also have to fight alone. But I also realize, I don't need anyone's help. It might be strange for you, but I've been in survival mode for years. What you're fighting for isn't me, that's my opinion. That's why I don't really care about our relationship anymore because for the past week, I feel like I can do without anyone. The wounds of the past two months have really left a deep scar. And maybe now is the peak.”\n\n..all because 2 weeks ago she wanted me to pay her trip to Hong Kong worth £450. And whilst money isnt an issue for me right now, I preferred to not spend them. Not because I don’t love her, it was because we can save money so once we apply for the UK spouse visa, I will have plenty of savings. \n\nYou see, I’ve never denied her anything (for the most part). During the past 3+ years we have travelled extensively, been to 10 different countries, visited many regions within set countries. I bought her the new iphone, have helped her many times when she would be sick, even though I wasnt physically there. Just food orders etc. \n\nNow she doesn’t want to talk to me, thinks am stingy and have made her feel like a “beggar”. But again, the reason why I denied her a trip to HK was because am trying to save up as much money as possible before we apply for a visa. All of the financial burden falls on my shoulders :( \n\nAm really distraught and sad, I’ve gone through a lot to make her happy and she now she brushes me off so casually. \n\nFor context, am based in the UK and she is from Indonesia. \n\nEdit: she just sent me this \n\n“You won, but you lost me.

It might hurt at first, but it will feel better later. I hope my absence gives you peace. I feel you Made me being too much and i hate it the most so i wanna keep my peace without you arround”\n\nafter I sent her a 10 min voice recording in which I spoke at length regarding the pressing issues and that I want her to go on the holiday.

During her first month abroad, I already visited her because I wanted to support her. She moved there alone with no help, and I brought her everything she left behind, her essentials and her hometown foods.\n\nA few months later, she started flying. She’s a cabin crew member, and it’s a really exhausting job. I work in corporate, doing 12 to 13 hours a day. Still, I always tried to adjust to her schedule because I was scared we’d get used to not communicating. Even before LDR, we weren’t always on our phones. And she’s always been so independent, which made me afraid she’d get used to not having me around.\n\nFor the past 2 to 3 months, she stopped asking me for help during her layovers in other countries. But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to push her. Still, I started feeling her becoming distant in the past couple of weeks. So I asked her what was going on and told her I wanted us to fight for this. I just needed us to communicate even just once a day. Not in an automated way like “I’m going out now” or a short “goodnight.” I was scared the love would fade without real conversations or time for each other.\n\nShe works with many men because of her job, and she’s told me that a few have asked her out. That scares me, not because I don’t trust her, but because someone else might give her the spark that we can’t create anymore because of the distance and time.\n\nShe told me she’s been trying to find our love again for a month. But now she says she feels trapped, like the relationship is just a commitment that’s weighing her down. She said she wants to choose herself this time and love herself first.\n\nWhat hurts the most is she told me she lied about our plans to get married in 5 years. She said she never really wanted marriage, and only said those things so I wouldn’t get hurt. But she’s told me countless times before that she wanted to be my housewife, that she wanted me to work and provide, and she’d stay home. She also told me that she was only going overseas to earn enough money to come back here and start a business.\n\nBut yesterday, she said she feels more alive with her job and traveling the world, compared to staying in our home country. That hit me hard because I know there were so many times she said she hated the job, that she was emotionally and mentally drained. I’m so confused. A part of me feels like she said all that just so I wouldn’t wait for her.\n\nI can’t help but think she’s just burned out from work, and that I’ve become part of that burden. I feel bad for pushing her. I’m willing to give her more time. If she doesn’t want to talk for a whole month, I’ll accept that.\n\nI just don’t want to lose her.

I said that his replies were not good. And im scared if I get too close, he will end up hurting me.\n\nWe got into another fight over him hiding his profile where he has our date 📅 and pictures from his family and friends. He showed me proof he didn’t hide anything. He created a multi-profile (one personally for me)\n\nWe fought again over my late replies.\n\nWe fought again a LITTLE bit. He called me the WRONG NAME.. 4-5 times we speak in a different language so I thought it was a cute way of saying my name so I asked. He said “oops typo”…. And claimed his phone is old\n\nJust fyi, I never stalk his socials but we have to text every other day on Instagram so i clicked his profile and saw his stories were hidden. I didn’t assume the worst but I used my back up account and I was in fact hidden.\n\nI just brought it up and we fought. He said it’s because of his old phone and he clicks wrong buttons. He has an iPhone with 2 cameras. My phone is even more older than his.. so I don’t believe this excuse.\n\nWe often ask each other “do you need some time? Some space?”\n\nI was going to break up with him after that but I truly like him. I feel im overreacting.\n\nBut I’m a huge avoidant and I avoided him instead. I just didn’t say anything. I felt extremely guilty so I came back. He was very upset again. We had a good conversation last night after we fought again. He explained some more but the old phone just still doesn’t seem right..\n\nThe fight of last night was.. he kept telling me “if you’re that nervous, end the relationship.” I then ended up saying the wrong thing because he said this like 3-4 times so I said “why don’t you just break up with me??” Then “is this why you’re acting this way? You want me to break up with you?”  He then said he’s catering to me and does everything I want. But I said I want to do everything for him too and he said he wants to ask me things like “what I ate or what I did during the day etc” (truthfully he never asks me these things so I’m confused) \n\nIf you read this all, what do you think? Don’t just say break up 😭 I actually like him but im very cautious with him.. \n\nSome background info about him before we dated:\n-He wouldn’t discuss how many sexual partners: which is OK but still little concerning..\n-He showed me a video of black screens of him having sex with his past girlfriend\n-One day I was using the feature where we met; to chat with some ppl, he saw me there and texted me very angrily. “Don’t you like me? We were more than friends?” And I was like.. “why were you there then?” And he just said he was looking if I was using it. \n-Im really not like this but maybe im nitpicking but he followed a few new girls but they look like sexy accounts.\n\n-He’s really sweet though and understanding of me. He always waits for me and texts me first. He’s also very goodlooking and my type in all ways, but im struggling and feel anxious dating him. He told me he feels the same way and was worried to mention how he felt insecure.

Met this girl on Instagram a while ago. Funny thing is, I met her ex–best friend first, but they were part of this friend group that was always fighting and toxic. At one point, it got serious. I took her side. Cut off the others, blocked them, got harassed, argued, all that just to stand by her.\n\nBut since the beginning, she always had a hard time giving me time. I let it slide. Thought maybe she’s just busy, or maybe I’m asking too much. We had amazing memories together, but also some really painful ones. I think we fought like four times total, maybe more that I can’t even remember. Every time, I’d be the one to apologize first, beg, take the blame, promise to change. And maybe I didn’t change fully, maybe my problems came back, but I tried. Every single time.\n\nThing is, whenever I brought up how I felt, especially when I felt ignored or distant, she’d always turn it into me “not trusting her.” Like no matter what I said, she’d twist it and say I was doubting her. And yeah, I was harsh during one of those fights I admit that. But I spent 7 straight days apologizing, sending messages, trying to explain. Wrote her kind texts, honest ones, even some desperate ones when it felt like she was just reading and not replying. She kept me on seen, turned off her seen and typing status too, and didn’t respond. Not even once. Just silence.\n\nShe was on a trip to India with her family, and yeah her parents are strict. I get that. But still, no message for 7 days straight? No “I'll talk later”? Then she came back just to get mad at me for sending emotional texts during that time. Like... what?\n\nI was sick too physically and mentally. Fever, anxiety, I was crashing. I just needed her to check in on me, something small.

As in, are you ignoring me on purpose or are you just stuck? And she blew up again. More fights, more pushing me away. No matter how polite I tried to be, she kept snapping. It just kept getting worse.\n\nEventually, I got myself unblocked by asking her sister. I just wanted to talk, figure things out. She said she needed more time. I waited. Again.

She always says I ruined her “mental peace,” that I cause drama when I just want to fix things. She made me question myself so hard. Said things that seriously broke me. When she did have time to message me during her trip, she used it to stay mad, not to check in.\n\nI reacted badly to one of her stories after all that. She finally sent a long paragraph saying I always find the wrong meaning in her words. That it’s not her fault, it's just her reacting to my reactions. So now I’m just here. Sitting with all this. Still wanting her back. Still hoping, for some reason. Even though deep down I know she probably doesn’t deserve me. Why do I still want her? Is this love? Or am I just trauma bonded to someone who was never really there for me in the first place? I know this is messy. I know I wasn’t perfect either.

And for that such short amount of time, the true spark and love i gained for this girl was like nothing else before. I hated the idea of long distance and never wanted to ever do something like it again.\n\nBut i was ok with being friends with and just calling and playing video games every  so often, but the more alone time i had with her the more i realized just how much i seriously loved this girl. So after a few months of us just being friends with some rare moments of flirting. I caved in and asked her out,  She agreed. She was even excited because she had been waiting for me to ask her this for a long while.\n\n  \nSo that's great and all, but here comes the reason im posting here. Sadly, me and her have just ended things a couple of days ago. It was very abrupt, and not expected. She had told me that she still loves me just as much as the day she fell in love with me, But the distance was beginning to get boring for her. She was a rather social girl and online intereaction wasn't always her preference. But we made it work while we could.\n\n  \nIt really hurts. Spending time with her like its the first couple months meeting again is not something i ever wanted to go back to. Not being able to say i love her, or any sort of intimate thing. Not being able to show or express how i feel when i feel. I decided to only stay friends with her because the night we decided to end things, she sobbed her eyes out, and let me tell you, i have NEVER heard a girl cry that hard before. \n\n  \nAnd in the moment, i just sucked in all the pain i felt and told her everything's okay. And that i wasn't going anywhere. I'd still stay in touch with her and be friends with her. But i cant lie man. This shit hurts. I don't want to step away because she had done so much for me in those 10 month's she came in like a one hit wonder. And it just makes me question all of it at the end. What was this really?.

We dated for 2.5 years — a relationship that had its fair share of highs, cuddles, college bus rides, silly fights, and unfortunately… jealousy.\n\nThe issue? There was this one guy — someone she saw a lot because he lived nearby and they took the same bus to college. Nothing ever happened between them (I know that now), but my jealousy started chipping away at our peace. Along with typical couple hiccups, it got to a point where we mutually broke up — not with anger, but with a quiet heartbreak and promises to stay close.\n\nShe said she’d lost the feeling and didn’t want to be unfair to either of us by staying when her heart wasn’t sure anymore. That line haunted me for months.\n\nAfter the breakup, I spiraled into Reddit. I made this account, posted our story across subs, read thousands of similar tales — stories of lost feelings, of rekindled love, of final goodbyes. Most replies told me to move on. “If she’s lost the feeling, it won’t come back,” they said.\n\nBut life had other plans.\n\nCut to last year: we both got into master’s programs, on different continents — she moved to the US, I moved to Europe. Thousands of miles apart, and yet... weirdly, we became closer. Being alone in foreign places made us rely on each other more — daily texts, random calls, helping each other through visa nightmares, exam breakdowns, and late-night loneliness.\n\nNo expectations, no pressure. Just two people who knew each other too well, finding comfort again.\n\nAnd sometime over those months… the feeling came back. We both felt it, but waited. Neither wanted to ruin the bond we had rebuilt.\n\nEventually, we talked about it. She said: “I don’t know when or how, but I started feeling again.” And I said: “I never really stopped.”\n\nWe’ve been back together for 10 months now. Still long-distance. Still on different continents. But this time — no jealousy, no overthinking, just effort, growth, and a little belief that maybe, just maybe, some stories do get a second chapter.\n\nTL;DR\nDated for 2.5 years, broke up due to jealousy and \"lost feelings.\" Stayed close, but she didn’t want to get back unless it felt right again. Fast forward — we moved to different continents for our master’s but grew emotionally closer. The feelings returned naturally.

In a couple weeks we both head off to college. I’m staying at home and she is going to another city but I’ll still be able to visit her somewhat often.\n\nOur relationship has been really strong always and I love her more than life. She’s everything to me but I’ve always been paranoid about losing her. Because of that I’ve always tried to keep my worried and anxiety to myself knowing it was irrational. I have often feared she was cheating or going to breakup with me even when I knew it wasn’t true.\n\nThis last year my gf was really struggling mentally and so like always I’ve taken the brunt of being there for her emotionally. It started to take a toll on me during the summer and my anxiety has been getting really bad. As the summer went on my girlfriend formed a really close friend group and has been doing wayyyy better.\n\nShe spends time with a guy I’ll call Dan. She met dan on a trip and they got really close fast. They have almost everything in common from music to hobbies. They even started working together. The past month or so they’ve started spending almost everyday together. They work together during the day and after work she drives him around for hours before hanging out at his house. Occasionally I’ll ask and she’ll invite me or bring him to my place. Over the summer she’s also spent less and less time with me especially one on one.\n\nTo clarify she is not cheating on me I am sure of that (at least not physically) because Dan also has a gf who is in our friend group (and ofc I do trust my gf) but it does affect me knowing that Dan is into everything my gf likes and is also exactly her type.\n\nOver the past year my gf also developed a hate for phones due to her mental health issues and during the summer she’s been barely using her phone which I think is why her mood has improved. While I’m really happy for her I also lost that last bit of connection as now the only time we talk is when we are in a big group or for a few hours before bed when she sleeps over (which happens maybe 5-10 times a month).\n\nI want to bring this and other concerns and worries I have up to my gf. Not because I think any of my concerns are valid but because I think my behavior has started to affect her and our friends. I’m going on a trip with her Dan and his gf soon and I won’t have the chance to sit down with her and talk before the trip and don’t wanna ruin her trip either. But I also don’t know if I wanna wait till we get back.\n\nDoes anyone have advice? Do you think It could be beneficial if I keep this to myself and just ask to spend more time with her? Do I open up after the trip? Or would it be a good idea to have this conversation over text?\n\nP.S. sorry if this is just me rambling I’m just really confused.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We both seemed happy with each other and the relationship.\n\nThen, at 9:25 p.m. (my time), I got this message from him on Discord:\n\n“Hi, sorry something very serious just happened in my personal life and I am not going to have the time for this, sorry to mess you around and I genuinely wish you all the best.”\n\nAfter that, he blocked me on Discord and even deleted the Reddit account where we met. I tried to check in once from another Discord account, just to make sure he was okay and get some clarity, but he blocked that too.\n\nIs this normal? Or maybe something guys do?

If you remember a post with a girl from the US kissing the guy’s (from Portugal) cheek, this is me again and I desperately need your help.\n\nThings had been going so well. We’ve been planning a trip to get me to him in October to November. It’s stressful and a lot to figure out quickly. I also had a stressful thing in my life and kinda nitpicked at him a lot this week, things were tense. However, he still was affectionate and eager to call and talk to me. He then worked 13 hour shifts 4 days in a row. His best friend’s dad died. He started really feeling stressed about figuring out part of my visit. Within the past three days, he has gone from affectionate and loving to shut down. I felt it, and asked yesterday, and he said he was starting to feel really stressed about the details of the trip. And the future, he can’t be the reason I leave everything because what if it doesn’t work out.\n\nWe called last night (we are both under the influence during this call… so it’s a bit all over the place). Started by discussing the trip, he’s talking like he still wants me to come. We laugh and have a good little time. Then I ask why he has seemed off lately. Less flirty. He says “I don’t know, it’s just not really flowing”. I ask if it’s because he’s tired and stressed, or if he’s feeling differently. He says he doesn’t know. I push and ask if he hasn’t said he loves me because he isn’t feeling it. He says he isn’t sure how he’s feeling. He feels like he’s lost some feelings but has no idea why. He does want to lose feelings and doesn’t want to see other people. I ask if he’s excited to talk to me, he says sometimes, sometimes he does it because he knows I like it. \n\nI get upset, kinda push to see if he’s got any fight for me in him, and get hurt when he can’t say he definitely wants this. What he DID say is that he definitely wants to see me and be with me again. But he feels like a real future is impossible because of the distance.\n\nI asked him to think about our favorite moments from my visit. I named a few, and he smiled from ear to ear. I asked if he loves me in those moments, and he said yes absolutely. He’s never felt that way with anyone and wants that. I said that that is how he feels about me then, that the other stuff is noise and stress from the distance. That how he feels about me and how he feels about the situation are two different things, and reminded him that the distance is temporary. He asked how it could be temporary. I told him we would cross that bridge when we came to it, but that it isn’t impossible and to focus on what we want NOW. To see each other again.\n\nHe asked to go to bed, I said I was scared this would be our last call, and he said it absolutely wasn’t. \n\nToday, he’s been very distant. It hurts so badly to have him not sure how he feels, when three days ago he was so into it. Nothing happened with us specifically, so all I can think is that he’s overtired and overwhelmed and overthinking, and shutting down. That maybe he’ll come around. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I want to push to get the trip figured out (this is our only chance for a trip for about six months, but we have about five days to figure it out before I lose my prices and reservations), because I genuinely think it is what is needed right now. I want to call him and reminisce together on our favorite times and things about the other person. But I also want to not push him and give him the space he needs to not be overwhelmed if that’s what is causing this. \n\nI do not want to break up, so please don’t comment that. I want to see him in person again, like he said he wants too, but don’t know how to go about this. This morning I asked if we could just get it figured out so we can let go of that stress and he didn’t respond to that. Please let me know if you have any insight or experiences in similar situations!\n\nTLDR: boyfriend extremely stressed, overtired, overwhelmed. He’s not sure if he’s in love with me right now? Im not sure if he’s feeling this way bc of the distance or other stressful things in his life, because I know it’s not me. Feels a real future is impossible. Just wants to see me in person again. Planning trip, but on a time crunch, which is adding to his stress, but only way to see each other again and bring the life back into this. Not sure what to do. Don’t want to break up.

Thank you in advance!!\n\nSo this is my first relationship an ldr nonetheless and I personally feel our relationship lacks “sexual” intimacy amongst intimacy in general. We talk, text, and game online together daily and the most flirty/ spicy thing we had done was masturbating over the phone twice in the first month (She wasn’t comfortable so we stopped) and occasional “join me in the shower” texts. \n\nOur relationship (4 months now) has been defined as “talking” until she recently met me in person. We didn’t have sex this time which I’m not stressed about but was hoping the second time we meet in another month or two that we would. Most we did was a long hug and my hand on her thigh during a movie. \n\nIt has been like pulling teeth to get her to agree to occasional selfies and video calls twice a week (I’d prefer daily video calls but compromised on twice weekly). She is insecure in her body and I do my best to reassure her.\n\nIs this normal and I just need more patience? I feel like in person couples boink in the first month (not that I need that).

However, my mother refuses to talk to him or try to work something out with me.

{"id": "u/idrinkchocolatemilk6_425", "user": "u/idrinkchocolatemilk6", "text": "Trying to Move Things Along Too Fast or Is This Normal for LDR?\n\nHello Reddit users of LDR,\n\nI started talking to this guy I met through Instagram mid-June of this year, we still haven't made things official (mostly on my end because I feel it is still too early to jump to that yet). I haven't found much help online regarding my situation so I just want some insight from people who have been in LDR's. \n\nWe've never met in-person yet, but we are both in our late 20s (same age) and have several common interests, but I'm just starting to get strange gut feelings due to things we've talked about or things that have been said to me. First, we live on the other side of the world - I'm in Ontario, Canada, he's in Victoria, Australia.\n\nExtremely early on in our communications he has  mentioned me coming to visit him, constantly. Never are there any things said about him coming over my way to meet. I've travelled quite a bit in my life so far, and he has informed me he has never left Australia and doesn't even have a passport and is terrified of flying... Another thing that makes me a little weary is that he's never had a girlfriend before, and has never even had sex yet (not a huge deal, but the never had a gf part makes me slightly nervous). I've been in some toxic relationships in the past and have dealt with some traumatizing experiences, so personally, if we eventually do meet in person, I would like it to either be here in Ontario, or another location I've been to/have family in (Germany or Ireland, as I also have family members there).\n\nI've also made it clear from the start that I could never live abroad, for a couple reasons: 1. I'm extremely close with my family and could never live a plane-flight away from them, 2. I'm currently finishing up my undergrad and will hopefully be starting Teacher's College in September 2026 - if I become a teacher here, I will work 10 months of the year and would not be able to do a \"live here for half the year and live there the other half\". What got me is that literally 3 weeks into talking with him, he brought up \"I'll live in Australia for 6 months of the year, and Canada the other 6\". I just can't see that working out long-term and also, that seems waaaaay too early to be 'planning' that, also mentioning kids/having our own place, and 'getting rich for \"me\" so that I never have to work in the future\", that does not entice me one bit, just seems way too fast to be saying these things, and also a bit 'day-dreamy'.   \n\nHe also is in constant communication with me, or so he tries to be. It's becoming very exhausting for me as we have full-blown conversations on three separate apps: Instagram, Telegram, and Snapchat, the Snapchat convos between us are long-winded, video format - sends me at least an hour's worth of snaps in one go. I'm becoming very overwhelmed as I'm also currently enrolled in summer courses and they've been very content heavy, I have communicated that I can't respond quickly to everything all the time and there may be lapses in my responses for a day or two, yet he will still send me a constant flow of messages throughout the day (despite the 14hr time difference). I know I don't have to respond to them right away, but I've even asked if we could cut communication down to just one app and that was completely ignored...\n\nHe's also in a better spot financially compared to me, works from home and is basically his own boss. I'm currently living off student grants/loans and have many bills/obligations to pay for, so travelling for me, is off the table for probably the next few years or so until I get a job in my field, or I somehow fall into money - but that's not realistic, lol. \n\nSorry for this being quite long-winded but I just would like some guidance as to how to deal with LDR's and if my current situation is just way too intense and I should just not continue on with this, I do like him, but I'm feeling very smothered and that my wishes aren't being listened to.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I don’t remember ever being so amazed by another person in my entire life, and the feeling was mutual. Then our relationship grew, we spent so much time together, made amazing memories and got incredibly close with each other. It felt like I’ve finally met the only person on Earth that spoke the same „language” as me, we have insane chemistry, same taste in music, same sense of humour. We started basically living together, since we happened to live very close to each other, which was insane given the city we live in is huge. About a month or two ago he got a job offer in a different city. We talked about it a few times, but it didn’t get us anywhere at that time, we were just happy to live in the moment. He’s leaving town tomorrow, we talked two days ago and planned to just see how it goes. It’s not a relationship, since we’re both pretty mature and decided to give it time, but I have this urge to cut ties with my city and follow him there. Is 3 months long enough to know? Should I have a talk with him now, or see how things are in a while? We’re both heartbroken but secretly optimistic about the future and what it holds, I don’t want to rush things, but I’m scared I’m going to lose a good thing, a thing that some people never get to experience in their lifetime. I’m not happy with my life here, and I only realised that after meeting him, how much was missing. I’m a realist tho, but a romantic at heart, and I feel dizzy thinking about the future.

I'm an aspiring law student and I'm starting a new job soon. I decided to edit my instagram profile to remove emojis from my name which had the heart, locket and the Turkish nazar because I was experimenting with fonts and simplifiyng my profile, I had forgotten my girlfriend asked me not to remove it before twice (Symbolic), but since I was giving my profile a complete change I deleted it. Immediately I get an upset message asking why I deleted it. I told her it was a profile makeover and I didn't want it to be childish anymore or too colourful. She got mad and stopped calling me her love and eventually just left the conversation after saying it no longer has a meaning to her and didn't matter.\n\nI apologized and told her I will restore it to how it was, just in a different place on my bio. She didn't say anything and just kept ignoring me for two hours and intentionally not reading my texts. I thought she was upset, so I called her since she had a bad week, but she kept declining. Then I got upset she was intentionally avoiding me, so I texted her and said how am I supposed to know how she feels or trust her when she stonewalls me instead of healthy communication? I said I wanted to resolve this and I felt hurt something so simple had a huge impact on her.\n\nFast forward, I call her and she calls me insecure and childish she demands I delete the emojis now, she will watch me do it and keeps threatening she will hang-up on me if I don't delete them. I kept telling her I'm not going to let her do this to me. It is my profile. She says hurtful things, so I eventually cry, and I notice I am deeply emotionally hurt because I had a lot of things happening, graduation close, exams, moving to another country, financial issues and family problems... Immediately she tells me to stop crying saying it's pointless. I explain to her I don't understand why she is treating me this way, but I feel hurt. I tell her all I wanted was to apologize but her intentional behaviour to hurt me affected me. My behaviour changes and I get mad at her. I ask would she treat her family this way? She doesn't respond. I ask if she loves me, she says she can't answer. She tells me she's the one getting mad now.\n\nI try to resolve the situation by saying I love her maybe I overreacted at the start, but that I still felt hurt, but she pins it on me. We call again, she tells me to go fuck myself accuses me of cheating because my followers keep increasing, she says I probably removed the emojis to be single. She starts trying to flip the script, saying I'm the issue, I'm insecure I almost threw a remote at her one day (When in reality when I came to visit her in Turkey she refused me to buy her presents, said she didn't want them, didn't allow me to pay for the restaurants and even confiscated my pants and put them in a locked safe because apparently my outfit was too tight for her tastes) Back then I broke down because I was emotionally upset, I threw the remote at the bed and burst out crying. Now she brought it up to say I'm unstable just because I broke down crying. I reminded her she's the one with trust issues because on our first meeting she pinned me to the bed and confiscated my phone not trusting me. She got drunk and almost assaulted me, but I told her to stop and threw her off when she touched my neck. I said we wouldn't resolve anything pointing fingers.\n\nNow she's telling me I'm the problem, I'm overreacting, I'm insecure and childish and that I shouldn't be upset or crying over this. She asked me what I wanted her to do, and I said nothing just reflect on the situation because neither one of us is right. I said I would have appreciated an apology, but she told me she didn't do anything wrong so she's not willing to see my point of view. She just left the call yesterday and went to bed without an apology. Today she texted me good morning without any affection.\n\nAm I overreacting, did I do something wrong by removing the emoji's from my profile and apologizing to her? Was it wrong for me to have emotions and cry when she accused me of cheating and following people?

{"id": "u/F___Z_E_R_O_446", "user": "u/F___Z_E_R_O", "text": "goddamn distance, it's breaking me\n\nWe're both 21. This is the summary of what happened in nearly 2 months... 2 weeks of everyday meetup, 3 weeks of long distance.\n\nWe first knew each other at a party, just staring at each other, and it hit me, I would like to talk to her, but I didn't have the courage to do so. After that, I just ignored my feelings. Then, 1 month later, with the help of my friends, we connected. She told me that she had a crush on me at that time. Since we were introduced via chat, we called each other for 5 days straight before we met personally.\n\nWhile talking, we became too intimate with each other. It was like we had known each other for many years. All the kinks we had, how high our drive was, it was like talking to a mirror, that's how alike we were. We talked like that for days.\n\nThen I picked her up at the station. Immediately, we held hands. In our meeting, we teased each other many times. We had just met, but it felt like we were the greatest couple out there. Somewhere in a café, I courted her properly because all I thought about was having a proper relationship and having her to myself.\n\nWe then saw each other every day for 1 week. At the end of the week, we had a study group at my house, and we were just close to each other, like we couldn’t be apart. At night, I accidentally looked at her phone because I thought she said something about still having photos of her ex. So, I searched her gallery just a tiny bit and stopped immediately. After that, I only put my fingerprint on her phone, then nothing else. We just cuddled until morning, and I thought it was nothing because maybe she would delete them anyway.\n\nAfter a few more days, we still saw each other every day until she said she needed a quiet place to study. I invited her to my house because it was only me and my grandmother day and night. We became so comfortable that something happened, she had a kink about being dominated, so I did. After a few days, the same thing happened again.\n\nEvery day felt perfect to me because it had been years since I felt something like that again. A true love, you could say, because it felt like looking in a mirror at myself. We understood each other that much... or so I thought.\n\nThen a problem arose. She had been held back for a year, so now she needed to study for 6 years instead of 5. She also had a habit of hurting herself with a razor on her shoulder. It was a past habit that came back, she had scars on both her legs, shoulders, a little bit on her chest, and a little on her back.\n\nNo, I did not support her doing that, at first, but my friend said maybe I should ignore it for now, and I did. She also said something like she didn’t want to change because it felt like being controled. So, I just comforted her. This was the only time I saw her like that. For a few days of her being negative, I comforted her every time, saying, *\"I'm there for you,\"* *\"I'm not going to leave you, I promise we're in this together.\"* I meant every word, that’s how serious I was about her.\n\nAt first, it wasn’t all about being intimate because I liked being physical, but it turned into something more serious love.\n\nWe were now on a break because she needed to go home, miles away like a 5-hour drive. After 1 week of being long distance, she suddenly said we should see each other less. She would decide when we were going to meet and call. She also said it was her fault for being too intimate, that we were acting like more than just a courting couple, and that we should be in a more ordinary courting stage.\n\nAfter all that, she suddenly messaged that we needed to slow down because she was feeling overwhelmed, like we were *more than lovers* (she had been thinking about this for a week, she said). The only thing I did was agree with her and respect her decision.\n\nAfter 1 week, we met for a day, and guess what we did? We only watched a movie beside each other with less touching. When we said goodbye, it was only a hug. But at the 1st two weeks mark, we kissed goodbye (see the difference?).\n\nThen it was long distance again. After 2 weeks, every day she became more distant. I ignored it and just messaged as usual, but every day she would say that she missed me. Then, during my family outing, I got a message: *\"I miss you,\"* she said.\n\nAfter that, I had another outing with friends for 1 week. At that time, she became even less chatty. She knew my friends (because some of them were also her friends), and most of us were in relationships, so there was nothing to worry about. After a few days of her being less chatty, she suddenly stopped messaging for nearly a whole day. Then, at night, she confessed through chat:\n\n\"I've been meaning to talk to you. I'm sure you noticed that I've been distant.  \nBut yeah, I want to stop this already.  \nIf I'm going to be honest, there are things in the relationship that gave me the ick, things I TRIED to tolerate but just couldn't.  \nI tried everything because I genuinely wanted to see what could happen between us.  \nIf this is the relationship I've long wished for and yes, it was, at first.\n\nWhen I said we should be physically distant from each other, I already told you that sometimes I think about ending things.  \nAnd that's the thing, since then I really have been trying.  \nThat's why I gave you a chance, that's why I said we should start over.\n\nBut I don't know.  \nThese kinds of thoughts just suddenly resurfaced.  \nAnd believe me, I really thought this through.  \nTo be truly honest, I've been feeling this way for like 3 weeks already.  \nBut like I said, I did try.  \nAnd this decision, I thought about it for a week too.\n\nAlso, there's been a lot happening in my personal life, as you can see from my notes most of the time.  \nSo yeah, I don't think I can handle anything right now.\n\nOne of the things that resurfaced for me was your actions regarding privacy  \nlike putting a password on my phone and accessing my photos.  \nMaybe because I let you do that when it happened, it's only now that I'm feeling the impact.\n\nAlso, there's been a lot happening in my personal life, as you can see from my notes most of the time.  \nSo yeah, I don't think I can handle anything now other than that.  \nMy mind is also a bit torn when it comes to my parents right now.\n\nI really am sorry.  \nI tried, so hard.  \nI gave myself so many chances.  \nI really wanted it to be you.  \nBut the longer it went on, the more I noticed that my feelings weren’t developing the way I thought they would.  \nI hope you understand.  \nI'll have to focus on myself for now.\"\n\nThat’s where it ended. I replied, saying I noticed her being distant, that I changed myself for her, and that she should give herself more chances. She replied that it wasn’t going to work anymore, that she was confused with herself and didn’t want me to experience that, and that I deserved to be happy and shouldn’t suffer because of her. I begged her to stay, but she dropped the bomb that it wasn’t a discussion, she just wanted to message me so I wouldn’t have to wait.\n\nThis is what I think: Did I become too controlling? After making that mistake with her privacy, I never brought up her past. We didn’t even do anything during those 3-4 weeks apart. It only feels like I was used.\n\nHere I am, thinking all sorts of things because I thought it was too perfect. After years of not being in a relationship, this is what happens to me. I already decided that she would be the one. I don’t think I’ll allow myself to go back into a relationship after this one.\n\nThe mistakes I think she had, She didn’t want to change. When she talked about her exes, it was like she was reminiscing about them. She self-harmed.\n\n(If you want to know more or have questions, please ask.

I look at the moon or at things I find beautiful and I remember her, but she distanced herself from me because of the distance, which is almost 4 hours apart. I was planning to move next year, in 2026, to her city because I dream of marrying her. She is the woman of my life. She’s not like the others: she doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke, doesn’t go out at night, she’s never kissed or done other things. She has principles and that is rare to find nowadays.\n\nShe has such a unique energy, we were very similar, we had the same views on everything. She is one of a kind and the damn distance ruined everything. I don’t blame her, I just wanted to be with her. Apparently, it will never happen and I will have to live with this emptiness until I die. The person who ends up with her is so lucky, really lucky.\n\nToday, once again, I messaged her and I’m crying, crying a lot. She said this:\n\nUnfortunately, things are going to be like this because I feel this way and even though I have always loved you and you have loved me, I feel this way and I don’t want to.\n\nLet’s leave it here because we are only hurting each other more, whether it’s you because you want to try so much, or me because I don’t want to feel this way.\n\nThe future, no one knows it, and we don’t have to guess it, we just have to let it happen.\n\nI’ve already told you that if we are meant to be together, we will be, but right now this is how I feel.\n\nI never doubted what I feel for you and what you feel for me, but unfortunately, it will be like this.\n\nLet’s go our separate ways and if in the future we are meant to meet again, it will happen… if not, I’m already happy because I know I carry parts of you with me for the rest of my life.\n\nIt’s not easy for me to feel this way either, but unfortunately, it’s what happens and I have to be honest with myself. It’s never your fault or mine, I just feel this way. You live your life, if you want to come here, you come and you do well, and I will follow mine. I’m sure if we’re meant to be, fate will bring us together. If not, I’m also sure we’ll both be very happy just for carrying parts of each other in our hearts.\n\nIt’s not easy for me to write this to you, but I also know it’s an act of maturity to be honest with myself first and then with you, because no matter how much it hurts, we will go on with our lives.\n\nAnd please don’t hold on to me because that’s never what I want, I just want to see you well, period. Sorry, but that’s how I feel, so unfortunately, yes, it’s definitely over.\n\nAnd if in the future we’re meant to be together, it will happen. Otherwise, and if someone comes into our lives, I’m sure we’ll both be very, very happy.\n\nIf you need to unfollow me, block me here, whatever makes you feel better, I will absolutely respect it.\n\nDon’t hold on to me because I want you to be happy, period. Let’s go our separate ways. Follow your life and please be happy.\n\nBut don’t hold on to me in any way because I want you to be happy and to grow, and I don’t want to become a burden in your life, something that only stayed to bring you down.\n\nAnd please understand that things pass, and please do everything you want or dream of doing because you do so much, like moving here.\n\nShe used to tell me these things:\n\nI learned that by your side I’m better, that by your side I want to stay, and that it’s by your side that I’m going to get married.\n\nI asked if that was just words and she said:\n\nIt’s not. What you see there is feeling, and I never lacked what I feel. What I feel has nothing to do with feelings. I just can’t handle the distance and I don’t want things the way you said. I don’t feel good in either option and I have to respect myself.\n\nI even asked if I could come see her this year, even just once, but she said no.\n\nShe will definitely meet other people and fall in love because it’s very hard not to fall in love with her.\n\nI lost the love of my life because of the damn distance.\n\nI feel an emptiness, I’m not okay, and I never will be because to be honest I will always be waiting for her and I will definitely see her with someone else and that will destroy me even more.\n\nOn top of that, she told me to move on with my life because she’s moving on with hers.\n\nBefore I messaged her today, I was even looking at houses to rent.\n\nI feel so bad.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

There’s been fights, tears, laughs and what not. By July 13th, he came to my country for a visit and he’s gonna stay until October 4th. This is our second meeting. The first meeting, I came to his country over the holidays. What was going to be the best summer ever turned out to be the hardest summer ever. Here’s why… \n\nEver since he came to my country, he’s been nothing but argumentative, negative and have attitude like he owns the place. We’re staying at my place and I made everything ready for his arrival. I cleaned my apartment, washed my sheets, everything. The apartment was spotless. \n\nARGUMENTS: \n•Because I’m living on my own with my dog, he’s been offering to help out with stuff around my place, for example walk my dog, do the dishes with me, laundry, etc. but he hasn’t been living up to that. I get it, he’s in a new place and has to settle down but I mentioned it for him as soon as yesterday. His response: “maybe you could pay me something for it. Like a chore! I do stuff and you pay me for it” \n\n•He becomes upset every time he asks how I’m doing and I tell him I’m doing good and nothing’s wrong. I’m telling him the truth, yet he still accuses me of lying \n\n•Whenever I keep “lying”, he becomes more mad and leaves my place without telling me where he’s going. I know that he’s going outside to take a breather but he doesn’t have any data on his phone so I can’t keep contact with him. Then when he does come back, he gets mad that I didn’t come looking for him. But in my defense, it is pretty hard to find him when I’ve been searching the area and there’s no trace of him. As far as just 3 days ago, I was wandering around, looking for him for over an hour\n\n•The arguments turn into a fight. Literally… \nHe’s begun to (in his words) become comfortable, which of course would sound nice out of context but it’s not that case on my body. No, he hasn’t raped me or anything of that nature but he has begun to become more outgoing, meaning that he’s held me tight in my arms twice. The second time, he did it so hard that I couldn’t feel my hands and bruises were left on my arms\n\nWHAT DO I DO?: \nMy family absolutely loves him. I haven’t told them about what’s going on. I’ve never really talked to my family about personal problems before so I wouldn’t know how to start or where to begin. \nHe’s low on money to buy a ticket to go back home again, and he’s saying it to me like it’s my responsibility that he has enough money. \nHe was on a FaceTime call with his parents last night, he told them both with a smile and pride in his voice that “everything is going peachy here”. So please… if you’ve gone through the same or have any advice, please share.

Just for reference, if there had been some sort of medical emergency with them, all of this is null. The problem is, I just don't know.\n\nI have been seeing this person for more than a month now, and when things are good, they're great. We both like the same music, we both have the same family goals, we both share a lot of the same political and religious ideas. We can spend all day talking if we had the time. I really enjoy their company.\n\nThe biggest hurdle, and this has genuinely made me reconsider the relationship, is that there have been times where they will just disappear for days at a time. Like, we are talking 3-4 days. (Note, they do not currently have a cellular data plan, so they rely on public Wi-Fi). The first time it happened, they explained the situation. There was a medical emergency in the family and they couldn't get a hold of me.\n\nLike alright sure, but the least they could have done was like, text me and tell me what's going on right? Most hospitals I've been to have public Wi-Fi. There was no warning beforehand, and sure things happen but there was also no notice during either. It was only until after that I found out what happened.\n\nWe talked about it afterwards and they told me they would do better about letting me know when they can't get a hold of me, and things were good for about 2 weeks but now they have disappeared again. The last I heard from them, they were driving a friend to their primary care physician and that they had some work lined up later. \n\nLike okay, I'm happy they have work lined up. Life's hard, we all need money; but that wasn't scheduled until Monday, so why haven't I heard from them this whole weekend? Surely at some point you would decide \"Let me drive to a gas station or Walmart or something and use their Wi-Fi to check in\". Back when I didn't have a cellular plan I was pretty much never without internet, and I live in the middle of no where. That's just how good public and private infrastructure is nowadays.\n\nI talked to a friend of mine and he told me \"Once is a fluke, twice is a coincidence, three times is a habit\". My thing is, this has happened twice in the span of a couple weeks. If this is just a coincidence, it's a very, very strange coincidence. Like, don't you think if they wanted to check in, they would? Surely, surely they had plenty of opportunities, barring any real medical emergencies that would incapacitate them.\n\nAm I overthinking?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

(we were good friends before dating.)\n\nthroughout our dating she's never been super reassuring, she says words of affirmation are not her love language (they are mine), and she has a hard time saying things unless she really means it, and thinks if you say something too much it loses meaning... i don't really agree and make it a point to tell her i love her and miss her, but having her not say it back makes me feel a little stupid and like i dont want to do it anymore - mind you she did say she loved me first, but barely has again since then. i don't want to censor myself, but i can't help but feel like it's all one sided. also she says love u / miss u to her friends on the phone all the time, which makes me feel kind of demoted now that we're girlfriends.\n\nnow that we're apart again i feel so disconnected. she keeps bringing up her trip to visit me but keeps putting off getting a ticket. we've had conversations about what we want out of a relationship. i've said i want a real partnership, to feel like a unit, to build some sort of life together. she says she wants to not lose her independence (i dont think she has to) and that she doesn't really want to have a traditional relationship. she says she doesn't want to have an open relationship though, because she only wants to date me. but now im not sure what my role is.\n\nshe doesnt update me that much on what she does, or she does after the fact. she can go hours without texting saying she just doesnt like texting and would rather call. when we do call it's usually good and she'll update me on whatever she didn't throughout the day, but i end up feeling a little like an after thought rather than feeling like an actual part of her life that she takes into consideration. our calls never end on i love yous/ i miss yous and that makes me really super sad. lately she's also stopped sending good morning / good night texts..\n\ni don't know what to make of any of this and i know it sounds pretty terrible, but she's truly so incredible as a person and as a friend, and i love her so much that i want us to find ways to compromise and make it work. i'm clearly anxiously attached and i'm working on that on my end, but am i crazy to ask for more reassurance? i think the distance will drive me crazy if i can't feel more secure in this relationship, but i don't even know how to approach this since we've had some bad disagreements as of late. are we just totally incompatible? is there hope for us? any and all advice welcome :(", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We’ve been together for 3 months, so not long, and he’s had plans to travel for the last year, before we met. He’s travelling through Europe, then through South-East Asia, then settling in Japan where he’ll be going to language school in Tokyo for around a year. I’m already dreading it and this is going to be so incredibly hard, but he’s so wonderful and worth it, I’m gonna give it all I have.\n\nHe’s leaving a week today, and I feel sick with anxiety, thankfully, I’ve made plans to travel up to Greece and I’ll be staying with him for a week there, so there’s that, but that will be the last time I see him in months. I have some things planned out, but I’d love some tips to make this less difficult, he’s incredible and I want to stay with him whatever it takes.\n\nHere’s what I have so far:\n\n- I’m going to fly to Japan in either April next year or during the summer, hopefully April due to typhoon season, and I want to see him as soon as possible. I can’t do much more than that, I’m starting Uni in September, so we would have been moving apart regardless, but due to limited budget and term times, I’m quite restricted. I’m hoping I’ll be able to fly and meet him again afterwards, but I haven’t planned that far ahead (we’re from the UK).\n\n-Watching the same shows. Due to time zone differences, we probably wont be able to watch much stuff together, but we’re planning to watch some of the same shows so we can talk about them.\n\n- Text and call as much as we can (of course). I want to plan surprise online dates for him too, but I’m not sure what they should include (any ideas are so appreciated!!)\n\n- Possibly playing some games together as we both enjoy gaming. I’m a big Stardew Valley fan, and I think it would be really cute to have a shared farm on co-op and play together if he’s up for it!!!! There’s also Minecraft, and a game I’ve herd of called It Takes Two which looks fun and sweet.\n\n- I’d like to do dinner dates, but with the time zone difference (8 hours T_T), I’m not sure how that will work\n\n- Sending him gifts, ordering him food on busy days, sending him letters, etc.\n\n\nIf anybody has any tips at all, they’ll be so so appreciated!!

I won't bore you with a long story, I'll try to keep it concise.\nMy family and I used to live over in Europe. My wife and I are originally from Canada with all our family in Canada.  We decided to move back to Canada with our kids in order for our kids to have more family around.\nWhile in Europe, my marriage was strained. To the breaking point.\nAt the same time, I worked with a woman and became best friends. Thinking there may be something more.  \nWhen we got back to Canada, I separated from my wife.\nI entered into a LDR with this other woman, who is still in Europe with her kids. She's separated too.\nShe is amazing, perfect, and we're compatible on nearly every level.  She is my person, and I am hers.  We know this.\n\nThe flaw in this is that we are in a LDR, and because we both have kids in a divorce, neither of us can easily move to live with the other person.  So we're forced to visit each other once, maybe twice, a year.  Which isn't enough. \nI just came back to Canada from one of these visits. And it's really hard on both of us.  It hurts both of us so so much at the end of these visits.\n We're questioning what the plan is. Our kids aren't grown up enough that they don't need us. \nWe don't see a good solution for this. We don't want to wait 6 years or more before the kids are grown up in order to move. We also want the chance of having a kid ourselves, but if we wait that long, it won't happen.  \n\nI guess the question is,  does it get better?  Is there hope for us?  Or do we end it now, go through the pain of breaking up, and heal with someone else who is in our own countries? \nThanks in advance if you read this far and for any advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

{"id": "u/FancyPassion1211_467", "user": "u/FancyPassion1211", "text": "My (20M) girlfriend (20F) doesn’t want sex because of trauma, disassociation, and religious guilt, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nMy girlfriend and I (both 20) have been together for almost 2 years. We started dating at the end of high school and have been long distance during college, visiting each other every 4–6 weeks.\n\nFor some context, months before we were together, she was sexually assaulted at a sleepover. She and some of the other people there got really drunk and she was pressured by one of her friends (a girl a year older than her) into things she didn’t want to do. On top of that, she was raised in a super religious household that pushed purity culture hard, so she grew up feeling a lot of shame around the topic or idea of sex.\n\nIn our relationship (first relationship for both of us), we didn’t go past kissing for the first month or two. Eventually, we started doing more sexually and had sex for the first time around month four (after one failed and rly embarrassing attempt lol). We were both virgins (her assault didn’t escalate to intercourse, and was with a girl anyways). Our sex life was always pretty minimal since her libido was a lot lower than mine.\n\nAfter being long distance for a few months, she realized something: while she missed me a lot emotionally and physical, she didn’t miss sex necessarily. She still got a little horny sometimes, and we sometimes even phone sexted (embarrassing, I know haha, but desperate times call for desperate needs), but she didn’t really deeply crave or feel desire for sex it in the way that I did.\n\nDuring a visit during this spring semester, she told me she wanted to take intercourse off the table. She was still okay with other things (like touching and oral), but said she didn’t feel fully comfortable during sex. She later explained that she realized she was disassociating during sex, like mentally checking out, and that really made her uncomfortable. I honestly had no idea she was experiencing that, I just thought I was doing something wrong, or that she wasn’t attracted to me, or that I was bad at sex. I thought something was wrong with me and it made me very insecure with myself physically and sexually.\n\nShe also told me she wants to feel close during sex, and not lusted over. That made sense, and I never wanted her to feel objectified, but hearing that was hard because I thought I’d already been showing love and care for so many months, especially in those moments. We talked about what I can do to be close to her during sex, and I feel I implemented those things well. I wasn’t trying to use her, I just wanted that deeper closeness too. Sex to me is about love, bonding, connection. To me, it’s not just physical release, it’s an emotional and spiritual experience that brings extreme closeness (we are both fairly religious but view sex differently).\n\nI told her of course I respect her decision. I would never want to do anything she’s not comfortable with. But I also felt disappointed. And over time, even the “other” sexual stuff stopped, and physical intimacy became rare altogether. I eventually had a soft but honest conversation with her and said that I don’t think I can stay in a long-term relationship where sex is completely off the table. Not because I don’t love her, I really do love this girl so much, but because sex matters to me too.\n\nThis summer (she’s home from school), things have gotten even worse. But the reason being is because she told me she’s putting herself first now and is no longer doing anything just to make me happy, which I’m actually glad about, because she should never feel pressured. But it also makes me feel a little sick knowing that she might’ve done sexual things in the past just to please me, even when she didn’t want to. I had no idea at the time, and I’d never have been okay with it if I did.\n\nShe recently started therapy, but it hasn’t helped much yet. I know healing isn’t instant, but I’m starting to feel stuck. I even asked her once if she was seeing someone else, not because I truly thought she was cheating, but because I’ve seen a shit ton of similar posts online where that was the case. She said no, and I honestly do believe her, that’s not in her character at all and nothing would lead me to believe that.\n\nShe’s bisexual, and I’ve wondered if maybe she’s just not that into guys sexually, or just me\nsexually. I asked if that was the reason, and she promised it wasn’t. I also asked if she might be asexual, and she said no, though I could tell the question upset/offended her. I felt bad for bringing it up, but I’m just trying to make sense of all this.\n\nAlso, she got on birth control around the time we started long distance, and switched to a new one a couple months ago (I honestly forgot the reason why). I know her libido has always been low but I think this might be adding to it even more.\n\nShe says she feels broken and that she feels like less of a woman because of all of this. I know she feels really bad about herself and she’s scared I’ll eventually leave because of this. And the truth is… I might. I don’t want to. I love her more than anyone. She’s my best friend, I love her so much. I don’t want to imagine my life without her. But if sex just never becomes part of our relationship again, I don’t know how long I can keep going.\n\nI hate that this even has to be a conflict. I know she’s hurting. I’m not mad at her, because it’s not her fault… but I am really irritated and frustrated at the situation. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel helpless.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this? Can things get better with time and therapy? Or am I just waiting for something that may never change?

We have been dating for 9 months. \n\nImportant to note: Packages are easier to send to Japan and a little complicated to send from Japan to the UK. \nIt seems to be easier to send a variety of things to Japan but the customs form needed to send things from Japan to the UK is very complicated. (Sending a variety of things is very difficult. However, sending multiples of one thing or two things seems to be possible.)\n\nI have sent 2 care packages full of things to him & also ordered things from Amazon JP and sent it to his address. I haven’t received anything physical from him as of yet & all his gifts have been virtual (in game items of a game we play). I appreciate his gifts and enjoy them, but I have also expressed that I’d like to have something physical too. My reasoning is that If the game we play decides to close their servers then I wont really have anything as a keepsake & that makes me feel sad. \n\nI do however understand that it’s difficult to send things from Japan so I’ve said that even a letter would mean the world to me (since there are no customs forms required for a letter). He said he would and that he’d try sending me multiples of one item that I mentioned I really wanted but it’s been months & nothing.\nHe also mentioned he could order things from Amazon uk and send it to my house (he has my address and knows how) but hasn’t.\n\nI kind of expected something for my birthday last week as he did mention he was looking at postage forms & since we have the same birthday month I had been planning his present since June & sent him a package full of snacks he said he wanted to try (that’d withstand the summer heat of Japan lol) & other things I thought he would need that he had mentioned & handmade gifts & self care items to help him through work stress he was struggling with. I put a lot of thought into every gift as the sentiment and thought behind a gift is what means the world to me. \nHe ended up gifting me a skin in a game we play together that I did mention looked nice before & I do appreciate it. He also made a short video of a collage of photos of us together as a virtual letter which I really liked. But a part of me was bummed at not having anything physical to have as a keepsake again. Especially since I had expressed my feelings about only receiving virtual gifts before. \nDon’t get me wrong though - the video did mean a lot to me as it felt sentimental so I expressed to him how much it meant to me & it has been the best gift so far. \n\nI don’t know. I do appreciate everything he has gifted me so I feel very selfish and ungrateful feeling this sad over this.

I know the honeymoon period has ended, but at the moment I find myself falling into huge pits of depression/anxiety, where I feel he just doesn't care for me anymore, and the distance makes it worse. I think back to when we were away for the spring for only 2 weeks, and he'd call every single day. Now he barely calls twice a week. He messages everyday, and he's sweet, but it just doesn't feel the same.\n\nWe met up a week ago for a night, and are meeting up in a few days for another night as well, but this just feels awful.

Things like when he messages me, or calling me 'darling' when he messages. Even sometimes when he does call or after he calls, I feel the same. \n\nIt makes me so upset because I know I care about him so much, and I don't want to leave him – but I'm so tired of feeling like this. Like he doesn't care enough to call, or that he only agrees to see me for a night here and there for physical intimacy (if you catch my drift), rather than just for seeing me or spending time with me. It hurts a lot because when I start to feel like this, I cage myself off as a self-defence mechanism – I force myself to drift away so I potentially don't get more hurt in the long-run, but it just doesn't make a difference now anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for this?

I don’t even know why or what started it anymore. I genuinely feel like I’m delirious at this point.\n\nIt started on Monday morning. I worked out, showered, ate, and after working out I texted her, “I’m finished,” and sent her a cute reel from Instagram — because usually, I just scroll through my fitness-related content on there, which I like. Then she replied, “So you’ve been on Insta?”\n\nBut the first message I sent her after working out was, “I’m finished working out and I’m back now, baby.” After that, she was just dry.\n\nAlso, my house is tiny — everyone’s everywhere. I’ve got the PS5 console in my room, so my little brother comes in to play. My dad’s chilling in his room, and my mum is in the living room. I can’t even talk to her (my girl) properly, and she was getting irritated over that too.\n\nThen the next day was just… dry. No call, just texting. Isolation and distance, I guess. I went to sleep at 11 PM, and she usually wakes up at 12 AM for me. But I had to sleep early because I had a wedding the next day. I needed to be up at 7 AM to work out, do some tasks, get a haircut, and then pick up my mum’s makeup artist.\n\nI woke up to texts from her saying I don’t give a fuck about the relationship, that we haven’t talked at all, that I could’ve tried staying awake — and that she’s done asking for my time.\n\nThen wedding day came. Literally no texting from either side. I left my house at 2 PM and didn’t get home until 3 AM. Then I get texts from her saying, “You were doing all your activities without wondering or worrying about me, or even asking me anything.”\n\nLike… what? I barely even used my phone. I only took pictures and videos at the wedding — and honestly, I only take them to show her. Otherwise, I wouldn’t bother.\n\nI go to sleep after going back and forth with her for a bit. Wake up at 1 PM in a daze. Got up, ate, prayed. She was already home. We got on a call — she wasn’t even talking. (This is today, by the way.)\n\nI tried talking and calling her, but nothing was working. So I’m thinking, what can I even do? I’m not going to sit there for four hours like a muppet, constantly saying her name.\n\nThen she texts me saying, “Can you please stop talking, please. Just for once.”\nSo I say, “Alright, sure thing,” and I stop talking.\n\nJump to now — about 1–2 hours ago — I was helping my mum prepare food for guests coming tomorrow. After I finished, it was around 1 AM. I said hi to her and stuff because I know the situation we’re in, and then I said I was going to sleep.\n\nBut obviously, I wasn’t actually going to sleep — I meant it as a joke. (I do that a lot, like saying “I’m going shopping with my dad, so we can’t call,” and she gets upset, but then I say I’m joking.)\n\nThis time, though, when I said I was going to sleep, she just basically crashed out. And she’s still crashing out now — it’s 2:30 AM as I’m writing this.\n\nKeep in mind: I try to keep a good sleep routine so I can maintain my diet. I try to sleep at 10 or 11 PM, even though it’s the holidays, just so I can get good rest and lose weight — which she knows.\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not looking for validation, but I just want an outside perspective on this.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

I’m in Australia and she’s in the U.S.  \nWe broke up for a few weeks in 2024  because she cheated, before coming back to each other in July 2024. \n\nThings have been good. Not perfect, but when is any relationship perfect, right?\n\nAnyway, lately I’ve been sensing things are a little off. I can’t put my finger on it.\n\nYesterday, we had our usual ‘date day’. A day we set aside for each other. We cooked together and watched a movie vehicle on call. \nDuring the movie,  she was sending me Tik Toks. Anyone but no huge deal. \n\nAfter the movie, she. Seemed distant and distracted. She does this from time to time. \nI’ll be talking and hear her typing in the background. She won’t hear what I said so I need to repeat it. \n\nI asked her if she’s talking not other people and her response was “I don’t have time for that”.  Cool… so my brain went to ‘if she had time, she would?’ But I didn’t say anything. \n\nToday has been mentally hard for me for various reasons.  I communicated that to her and that I’d call her soon. \n\nHer reply was “Oh ok. I did a tik tok if you want to check it out”. \nSo I did. \n\nIt was her miming to a weird song, but she captioned it “reason #17635 I can’t be successful on dating apps”.\nI commented passive aggressively with “or the fact you’re not single”.\n\nFast forward to is saying goodnight (she’s in the US and it was late). \nWe ended our call and later she messaged me with this:\n\n“You know something I’m trying to be open with you, but I’m really craving that physical touch that having someone here and it kills me…and no I haven’t looked or tried anything because I love you I’m not trying to disrespect you cause it’s not fair to you. I just want to let you know how I feel and where my mind goes in all this. Again I’m not saying this to make you feel bad or anything I just wanted you to know how I feel that is all. I love you so much that it hurts to know we can’t be together on a physical base wise.”\n\nWith everything else going on - I reacted to her message in a way that I think landed wrong. \n\nI replied: “I get that. I’m in the same boat with you. \nIf you want to go, don’t stay just because you love me. \nDo what you want to do. \nI love you but I won’t make you stay if it’s too hard”\n\nThen she came back saying I’ve asked her to open up with me and this is the reason she doesn’t. \n\nThe thing is, I’m ALWAYS there when she needs me. She says she’s there for me but generally it’s not in the way I need despite me telling her this. \n\nAm I the asshole?\nI know I’m reactive today and I have since apologised more than once. \n\nShe said it’s ok and that’s it. \n\nI feel like I’m losing the one person I have ever loved.

{"id": "u/annnaabanaanana_486", "user": "u/annnaabanaanana", "text": "Need advice about a medium distance relationship with someone who works a lot :( Loving relationship but feels like we'll end up drifting apart\n\nHi all! I'm looking for any advice about my situation. I've been stressing and freaking out for days and I have no clue what to think or do. My boyfriend (22y/o) and I (21y/o) have been dating for quite some time. I'm a senior in college, and he is also a senior but has chosen not to continue with his degree (electrical engineering) at the moment as he wants to get some hands-on experience first.\n\nIn May, we took a big step in our relationship when I met his whole family and he met mine. Since then, we've been spending nearly everyday together and practically living together at his college apartment that is only about 15 minutes from me. However, now that he is taking a break from college, he temporarily moved back home to his parents' house (1.5 hours away from me) in the middle of June. For some more context, I live in the city and he lives 1.5 hours into the suburbs. Since he often ran errands in the city or worked catering gigs, he would often pick me up on his way back and I'd stay with him at his parents' house for a couple of days until he'd bring me back the next time he had an errand/catering gig. Since I typically work online, this hasn't been an issue with my schedule. Additionally, I do not have a car and aren't too secure with driving on a highway in general as I only recently got my permit, which makes it difficult for me to come to him. His parents' seem to be okay with me coming and have even suggested I stay at his house while he goes to work and spend time with his mom who does not work and his sister who works from home.\n\nI've been extremely happy building this great relationship with him and his family. Even though I'm rather shy and find it hard to open up at times, I've been getting more comfortable and attempting not to just hide out in his room or only stay by his side. While his mom consistently tells me I'm welcome to make myself any food in the kitchen, go in the pool, etc, I still feel as if this is me overstepping as a guest. My fear of over-stepping or making myself too comfortable plays a big role in the issue that has come up.\n\nRecently, he has started a different construction job with his cousin as he hasn't been able to find an engineering internship yet and is unsure when he will be accepted to one. He is happy with his job and loves it as the paycheck is rather later and a lot more than the internship would pay. I am extremely supportive of him pursuing his goals, and I know that this is what is best for him. However, I'm terrified of how this job will affect our relationship. He often works at construction sites 1+ hours away, meaning that he is leaving for work at 6-6:30am at the latest and working until 6pm (meaning he isn't back home until around 7pm). Due to his schedule, he is working/busy about 5 days a week from 6am-7pm daily. While he does have many opportunities to check in and text during the day due to the way their work flow is arranged, I feel as if I'm disrupting him and causing him to be distracted at work when he texts me.\n\nOverall, he's told me hundreds of times that this won't affect our relationship and he will be seeing me Friday nights to Sunday nights even if he is driving to get me and bring me to his parents' house or staying at the college apartment. I love him extremely and appreciate everything he does for me. However, I feel like our relationship will be putting an extra strain on him as he is extremely busy already. I don't want to lose him and breaking up or taking a break isn't even a thought on my mind or option. I'm just unsure how to handle this and what to do. Has anyone possibly been in a similar situation and have some insight?\n\nOne big option on the table is potentially taking the train to him. However, the trains to him run only every few hours and are often delayed. They require a transfer in a rather unsafe area, which puts taking the train at night as a last resort. However, with my train idea, I would be coming to him on Friday mornings/early afternoons so I am there when he comes home from work. However, I feel as if I may be overstepping and making myself too at home at his parents' home as it's relying on his parents to open the door or give me a key, which I believe to be WAY too overstepping as only a girlfriend in my boyfriend's parents home.\n\nI feel like my post sounds silly or like not even a problem or issue. I'm so sorry if this pisses anyone off or annoys anyone. I realize I may sound like I'm making a problem out of nothing, but I'm just scared that his busy work schedule will cause us to drift apart or he will over strain himself by attempting to see me and spend time together. I know we love each other and I hope we have a future; the relationship itself isn't any issue, it's simply me stressing about outside factors and looking for advice to take the load off of him in a way.\n\n**Overall,** I'm just searching for some advice or peace of mind about this situation :( I'm an avid over thinker and this has been keeping me up at night. I don't want to end up self sabotaging by thinking that I'm going to put too much pressure on him with the relationship + work as I believe his goals and work should always come first.\n\n**TL;DR:** My boyfriend and I (21F/22M) were basically living together near my college until he moved back home (1.5 hrs away) for a new full-time construction job. He's super busy now, and while he still makes time for me on weekends, I’m worried I’m adding pressure or overstepping at his parents' house if I wait for him while he is at work. I love him and don’t want to drift apart, but I’m overthinking everything and looking for advice on how to handle this change without stressing him or sabotaging things.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I don’t have a strong support system—my family is distant, I don’t have close friendships I can count on, and I carry so much alone. So when the one person who’s supposed to be my partner becomes just another emotional burden, it hits different.\n\nI’m more financially stable than he is, and I’m the one saving, planning, and trying to figure out how to visit. Meanwhile, he just waits. No offer to help me get there, no steps to come to me. Instead, he keeps asking for money to help with his kids—while I’m trying to prepare for us. I care about his boys, but I’m not a bottomless resource.\n\nHe wants to be treated like a king but hasn’t done anything for me besides talk. No gifts, no thoughtful gestures—until I finally blocked him for two weeks. Then suddenly... flowers showed up. After weeks of feeling unseen, dismissed, and emotionally starved, that was the only time he actually showed some kind of effort. Why does it take me disappearing to be acknowledged?\n\nWhen I go through hard times, he brushes it off. Says I’m American and should just get over it. If I try to vent, he interrupts or asks me to turn on my camera—even if I’m driving and clearly just need to be heard. There’s no empathy. No comfort. Just pressure.\n\nWhen I show kindness to others, he gives me the silent treatment… and eventually asks why I didn’t help his boys instead. It’s manipulative and draining. It makes me feel like love is only valid if it benefits him.\n\nI feel like I’m giving everything—my money, energy, emotional capacity—and getting nothing but conversation, guilt, and crumbs of attention in return.\n\nAnyone else ever been in a relationship where it only feels real when you threaten to walk away?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

(4 months in)\n\nI’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend 19F and me 19M for 4 months now. We met in a game and things moved quickly. I really cared about her, but something recently happened that made me question everything.\n\n\nShe told me she used to play Rec Room, but that it had been a long time since she last touched it. I wanted to try the game myself, since it was something from her past and I was curious. While searching for her profile in Rec Room to add her, I saw some public gallery photos of her with another guy. In one of them, he was clinging to her. I didn’t recognize him, but I had heard a name mentioned before—Jay. I asked her if that was him, and she told me no, that it was someone else named Joel.\n\nStill, something felt off. So the next day, I searched her name again and found a public post made by Jay with a photo of them together. That photo was posted on February 14 of this year—Valentine’s Day. That’s when I realized she had lied. She wasn’t just on Rec Room recently, she was active on Valentine’s Day, and she was with her ex.\n\nI looked at his profile and saw even more photos of them together, including one where they were kissing in-game. That confirmed everything I was suspicious about. She had been in a relationship with him last year, and now I had proof. I confronted her with what I found, and she admitted they used to date. She said she broke up with him because he wasn’t taking her seriously. She also told me she stayed friends with him because she got close to his siblings, and that she was scared to tell me the truth because she thought I’d react badly. She said they barely talk anymore and tried to play it off like it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nWhat hit me wasn’t that she had an in-game relationship before me. It was that I gave her a chance to be honest, and she still lied. Twice. I had to go out of my way to search, check profiles, and piece together the truth on my own. And now when I express how it made me feel, she says things like “unfollowing him won’t fix anything” or “it’s too late to unfollow now.” That just makes me feel like my feelings don’t matter.\n\nI’m not trying to control her or tell her who she can and can’t talk to. But we’re only 4 months into the relationship, and I already feel like my trust was broken. I feel stupid for even having to investigate, but if I hadn’t, I never would’ve known the truth. I don’t know if I’m just being sensitive, or if this is a sign I shouldn’t ignore. I still care about her, but this left a bad mark I can’t shake off.\n\nIs this worth trying to fix, or is this already too much for a 4-month rrelationship? 😭", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

For example, he might say something that upsets or triggers me, he sometimes begs for pictures of me or voice notes, or he might do something in a game that upsets me. Sometimes even the smallest thing he does makes me feel upset, and I don’t understand why I’m so sensitive over what he does sometimes...\n\nHe also refers to himself as a healer, saying it’s his job to “fix people,” and whenever I bring up my issues, he immediately says I’m the one at fault.\n\nFor example, today we were playing a game, and without warning, he hit me with a brush a few times. I did the same because I thought it was playful, but then I got upset and asked, “Can you please stop?” He said, “Instead of having fun, you took it like I was doing that seriously.”\n\nI explained It’s just that when my character was hit with the brush, I felt really uncomfortable because I didn’t realize we were playing that kind of game, and I prefer not to play rough without warning. I just wanted to play a cozy game with the person I love\n\nHe then said “You take everything seriously, even when it’s just a joke.” I mistakenly brought up breaking up, and he immediately said I was giving up and that I don’t love him. When I explained that I’m scared he’ll give up on me because he deserves better...he told me I “have to be better.”\n\nI don’t know if I’m messing this relationship up..but I feel drained and tired, and I’ve been crying a lot over this.

I've recently met someone online and we've texted and also talked via video chat so I definitely know it's a real person I'm talking to. After many texts and phone calls I've become drawn to this person both physically and emotionally...the latter being more important to me. Initially i wanted it to be more of a friendship rather than a relationship. I'm in one country and this person is in another and it's a 12 hour difference. I'm curious to see how any of you have maintained a healthy relationship considering the odds... or if you've decided to just stay friends. \nNote: this is my first time ever attempting to get into a relationship over a very long distance.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Since then, we’ve been talking every day:- calls, long texts, games, movies, music, you name it. It’s been amazing so far, even though we’ve never met in person.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I proposed to her, it was impulsive and a bit frantic, not how I’d imagined doing it, and honestly at that time I wasn’t even sure what I wanted. But as time passed, I’ve grown to truly love her or at least, what I believe love is.\n\nThe thing is, love and relationships are pretty confusing for me. She’s not my first girlfriend, but I feel like I’m new to real love. I have a few personal issues that make feelings and relationships feel complicated, sometimes I wonder if I even understand what love really means yet.\n\nShe’s highly emotionally intelligent, brutally honest, has strong morals, but at the same time she’s sweet, shy, and innocent in her own way. She has social anxiety but she’s so deep, she questions life with thoughts that makes me see the world differently. She still has that youthful spark: astrology, tarot, K-pop, romantic movies, daydreaming, dancing, singing, all that teenage girl energy that makes her glow.\n\nWe feel very attached to each other, sometimes maybe too attached, yet we still don’t feel close enough. We’re craving the real thing: the physical presence, the daily life together, the warmth you can’t get through a screen, but not just that, we’re craving connection, the one that makes you feel like the other person understands you, you are safe with them and you can be yourself around them.\n\nNow she wants to meet me and I want it too. But right now, I’m starting college (most likely) and I don’t have the money or time to visit her country yet. Realistically, it might take another year or more. And that makes me feel unsatisfied for her. I want her to be happy and to feel like she’s not wasting her youth waiting around for something uncertain.\n\nIf any of you have been in a long-distance relationship like this or met someone online and managed to make it real, I’d love to hear your advice. How do we keep this strong until we can finally meet? How do we handle the distance, the waiting, and the doubts that come up sometimes?\n\nThank you for reading our story,I’d really appreciate any advice or stories you’re willing to share. Hope you all have a great day!", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I live on the east coast and he lives on the west coast. His job is remote and mine is not; however, my company has an office on the west coast. \n\nWe talked about where we’d be willing to move together to close the gap and we both agreed we’d try to move to the west coast city where my company has another office. \n\nI’ve received formal approval from my company to transfer to our west coast office at the end of the year, and while I’m luckily able to keep my job, I am sacrificing a lot of access to senior leadership and power — and possible career opportunities — by leaving the east coast office, since we have a lot more senior leaders and executives there. \n\nHere’s where the difficulties come in. His dad who lives in the Midwest is sick. Understandably my boyfriend wants to support his dad and be close to him. But I feel like his reasoning is making no sense to me. \n\nDespite his current job being remote, he’s applying for hybrid jobs in the city where he currently lives (NOT the city where I’m transferring to, also NOT where his sick dad lives). He said he’s not willing to give up the job search in his current city because he has to choose the option that gives him the flexibility to see his family and also support them financially. I will note that he worries about job security because there have been layoffs in his industry (not at his actual company) and he is worried management might try to make his remote job into a hybrid job. \n\nI make about ~$40k more than him. I’ve talked to him several times about the financial situation, and offered up that I’m more than willing to pay a greater portion of rent and bills if it means we get to live in the same place. He will not accept my offer because he said it hurts his pride.\n\nI feel so hurt and honestly confused. He said he feels like he needs to choose between me and his family and I don’t understand at all how he came to that conclusion. He’s continuing to look for jobs in the city where I’m transferring to, but because most of his network is in his current city, he said he’s not willing to give up searching for jobs in his current city.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

(she did date another girl and was exclusive with her, posted online, etc which in all honestly does make me a bit insecure why shes hesitant to post me even though we say i love you every day) *not something i say to just anyone, or have said to anyone besides in a HS relationship 10+ years ago* i gave her space because all i want is for her to be happy and we eventually reconnected last August-Decemeber after she DMd me again. since then we have been texting and sending pics every day, video chats a couple times a week (we both live relatively busy lives, hers a bit busier than mine) sometimes we even get to sleep together otp which i love. the last few months have been hard because I feel like IRL things have been taking a toll on her, esp doing everything alone and being a single mom, i felt she was pulling away as the texts were becoming inconsistent, sometimes 24-48 hours apart, and im not really someone who chases, i want things to be mutual ofc. so i would give her space and just let her know i was thinking about her. i would get an i love you text back, then maybe an hour video call the next day while she gets ready for work, where we would say i missed you, I thought about you, but not really address the absence which is partially my fault for not pushing for an explanation (i think i was afraid of the answer being the same as last time, that LDR is too much and she needs something more substantial) mind you i am willing to drop everything and we have talked about me moving to her a few months ago but then it changed back to me just visiting, we're really not financially ready for a move currently anyway so maybe the talk was just pillowtalk and wishful thinking, so im feeling better about visiting and not rushing things because i want it to be perfect esp if it is deciding whether or not we move forward or go into a gf/gf status. everything has been going a lot better since ive booked my tickets last week, since then we have been in basically constant contact because we are both so excited we are finally meeting IRL. we've even got to sleep otp 3 times which has not happened in months, obviously every relationship especially new and LDR ones go through things and the last thing i want to do is add stress to her already stressful life which is why i havent pushed for exclusivity to to be posted. her love is all  i want really. i cant get her out of my head, i dream about her almost every night, shes so important to me and i dont wanna mess it up, we havent ever met in person but i am taking the train across states (about 15 hours, im staying for 8 days, 2 of them being travel days ) I am honestly so excited and also terrified at the same time. my anxiety is high because im worried about everything going perfectly, from the first time we lay eyes on eachother, first kiss, us matching sexually and romantically. any advice would be appreciated.\n\nTLDR: LDR closing the gap for the first time, non exclusively and her pulling away in the past has made me insecure about the relationship as a whole and im worried about meeting, I want it to go really well so im just looking for opinions and advice on what you think might be going through her head, and advice on how to handle the first meeting and the week we're about to spend together.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We became official a couple of months after, and we've been off and on since. We're both located in the US.\n\n\nIt's safe to say that I genuinely love him. I consider him my first love, my first actual relationship (the others were just filled with toxicity), and the first person I could ever genuinely relate to. We both know each other almost in and out, and are both very understanding of one another and we love each other unconditionally. I've accepted him for his interests, and he's accepted me for mine.\n\n\nThe first problem? He cheated. Twice.\n\n\nHe confessed to cheating on December 1st, 2024. He said he's cheated since my birthday (June 28th, 2024, the day we officially started dating) by talking to other girls and dating them individually online. It took until almost June of this year to heal from that, and there's been mutual understanding from both sides. Complete transparency too, allowing each other access to accounts, etc.\n\n\nBut of course, it happened again. But this time, it was more hidden.\n\n\nWe were arguing and he decided to play a game. Soon after, he accidentally invited me and I saw him playing with and talking to another girl. After a few minutes of back and forth, he left, and I talked to the girl he was talking to. She claimed he was complimenting her constantly, saying, \"You're so nice and amazing\" and other things. Note that they had only known each other for 30 minutes, the girl also claimed. She also said that he said that all he deserved was bad things said to him.\n\n\nI personally took that as emotional cheating, and didn't realize it until months later.\n\n\nThere was me screaming and crying on call, long talks, etc, but we managed to get over that hill (somewhat).\n\n\nIt took him a while to realize, too.\n\n\nNow the second problem ? He thinks I've cheated\n\n\nI had a friend (I've now blocked out of respect of my boyfriend) I told my boyfriend about, we'll call him N. \n\nI had met N while me and my boyfriend had known each other earlier this year. Our friendship was okay. I never held any real interest towards him, which caused me to ignore him a lot, and yesterday (yes, it's 1 am as of me writing this) I decided to respond to him because I felt bad for ignoring him. I kept things simple and straight, until N interpreted something I said differently. I was finishing up talking to my boyfriend and I told N to hold on, I was almost done.\n\n\nHe interpreted that as me pleasuring.. myself..\n\nAnd I didn't encourage it or say anything inappropriate to him. I kept telling him to shut up and even threatened to beat him up (as a joke, but you know). What makes that even weirder is that he has a girlfriend, and made the excuse that friends should help their friends out. I even mentioned that to him and he played it off like it was nothing.\n\nBut anyway, I decided to tell my boyfriend as I tell him about every conversation I have with someone, and he gets upset and interprets that as cheating as I didn't tell him right away. He thought I was hiding it from him, and he also got upset that I texted N while he was working. He was also upset at how I didn't tell him N was texting me before.\n\nNote: i go on a ask and tell basis. If he were to ask me something, I would tell him the whole truth no matter what it is\n\n All of this happened in the same day, and I didn't tell him as soon as I stopped responding to N because my boyfriend was working, and I didn't want to stress him out while he was. He said that wasn't an excuse and I knew it wasn't, but that was my reason why. He's asleep right now and I can tell he's very hurt by the conversation we had hours prior to this being posted. \n\n\nI really don't know what to do. I love this guy with all of my heart, and it pains me that he thinks I cheated when I think it's just a communication issue from my side (which I told him). He said I could believe that it's not cheating, but he perceives it as cheating. I'm shaking at the thought of us not being together, because I love him, and I know deep down he loves me. Our relationship is perfect besides the cheating conflicts. He's sleeping right now, but I'm hoping to be able to talk to him soon.\n\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend thinks I cheated while I have conflicting views of it, and I'm afraid it's going to affect our future with how our relationship's past has been.\n\n\n Does anyone have any advice to give?

He talked about marriage and sent me super long messages before bed and just randomly everyday.

So F (18) and my boyfriend M (19). We’ve been in an online long-distance relationship for less than a month, and lately we’ve been arguing over sexual stuff. He keeps bringing up that he wants to have sex with me—like, not super direct, but it’s obvious. I’ve already told him I’m not ready yet, but every time I say no or try to avoid the topic, he suddenly loses interest or gets moody, which leads to arguments.\n\nWe’ve already argued like three times over the same thing. And recently, we had a serious talk about it. He told me he just can’t control his urges. He said he wants to do it with me specifically, not just for pleasure, but because he feels like it’s part of expressing love in a deeper level and proving there’s no doubt between us.\n\nI told him to maybe wait for me and maybe just watch p0rn or whatever for now, but he said no—he wants it to be with me, and only me. The problem is, when I say I’m not ready, he gets upset and his mood changes—he becomes cold and distant.\n\nEarlier, he said we should either break up to avoid hurting each other, or stay together but he’ll stop being sweet and affectionate because he doesn't want to hurt me when he gets irritated. I’m so confused because I really want to stay. He said he loves me and doesn’t want to lose me, but at the same time, he’s struggling with his feelings and desires.\n\nNow, he’s asking if we could try doing something sexual over video call—like touching ourselves while watching each other. Honestly, I’m curious and I do want to do it with him, but I still feel insecure about my body and I’m scared to show it. I also wonder if his medications for his heart condition are affecting his sex drive and mood swings.\n\nI don’t know what to doooo.\nWhat should I do huhuhu? I really want to work this out. I wanna do it with him too, but I'm still scared. I didn’t expect this to happen so soon because I’ve never had a boyfriend before.

{"id": "u/EuphoricCountry5418_523", "user": "u/EuphoricCountry5418", "text": "Feeling Lonely in My Long-Distance Relationship. We’re Always on the Phone, But I Miss Texting (f/28) (M/23) Need advice!\n\n**TL;DR:** *My boyfriend prefers constant phone calls while I prefer some texting and writing. I’ve compromised a lot by staying on calls, but he rarely texts me anymore. Even when I send sweet, or flirty messages. I feel emotionally disconnected and overstimulated a lot of the time, but when I ask for more texting. He seems unhappy. I don’t think he’s trying to hurt me, but this is becoming a bigger issue. I feel lonely and unseen. How do I communicate my needs to him better?*\n\n  \nHi there everyone, this is my first post on Reddit. I’m (F/28) in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (M/23) of a year, and I could really use some advice. We have not met IRL yet, he is in TX and I am in SC.\n\nWe’ve been together for a year now and we’re struggling a little bit. I think, in short, he and I have very different communication styles. I understand a lot of this is on me as I have an anxious attachment style, and I’ve been working very hard to heal it. I’m aware of the issue, and when I see myself spiraling, I do my best to distract myself or work through it on my own.\n\nHe works long hours at a job where he can’t really be on his phone to text, but he can keep an earbud in to talk most of the time. We also have very different schedules. He’s an early bird, and I tend to be more of a night owl. He usually goes to bed around 6:30 PM to 9 PM at the latest, whereas I’m usually up until 12–1:30 AM.\n\nHe’s the kind of person who enjoys being on the phone all day and night. I’ve never been like that but I’ve really been trying to meet him where he’s at. Because I’m autistic, I need a lot of quiet time to recharge. Being on the phone constantly can get overwhelming and overstimulating for me. Draining almost. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being with *him.* I just start to feel like I have no space to myself. And I really do mean that we are on call *all day*—there have been times we’ve stayed on the phone (or Discord) for weeks straight. It’s become a regular pattern for us.\n\nHere lies the issue: I do really like texting. My love language is words of affirmation. His is quality time. I like sweet text messages, I like pet names, and I want to be able to reread our messages when I find myself stuck in an anxious cycle. That, above all else, is extremely grounding to me. I’m not sure if that’s healthy or not, but I’m sure you all will tell me in the comments. I don’t really expect constant replies from him or big emotional messages.\n\nTo explain another layer of this: he and I met on a platform where roleplay is very popular. I really do enjoy roleplaying—I love to write and read, and it made me feel incredibly close to him. He was amazing at it, and looking at the stories we got to write together is super moving.\n\nBut now, we don’t have a lot of overlap in free time. I guess I only get a few hours with him lately. He told me when we first met that he was bad at texting, and I told him I was bad at being on the phone. We laughed about it. But now we spend a lot of time on the phone and *pretty much no time texting.*\n\nBecause of his work schedule and the fact that he really can’t be on his phone, I often look at our messages and see many unanswered. He’s really bad about answering me. On top of that, he’s really bad about just responding to the last message I sent and ignoring all the rest of them—or not responding at all and just saying “Call?”\n\nHe’s now very dry through text, when he was once very affectionate with me. I would say on average, I get about five texts a day from him, even when we’re not in a Discord call. Things have changed a lot since we first met. He has a new job now where, for a while, he was waking up around 2:30 AM for work. He works a lot harder now, and he’s a lot more tired. For that, I *do* feel bad—I know he’s stressed, and I don’t want to add to his stress.\n\nWe’ve talked and argued about this. I’ve tried to bring this up to him gently. I don’t know what to do, because I *do* feel lonely a lot of the time, even when we’re on the phone. We often don’t actually talk much. He’s working and is focused on that, or he (sometimes both of us) are gaming and distracted with that. Then he goes to bed, and I’m alone for hours after.\n\nI don’t really feel understood or heard right now.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research and seen a lot of content about other couples in LDRs. One of the biggest things they always say is “be on the phone all or most of the time.” It makes me feel *guilty* for needing breaks from it. I want to connect with him in other ways too. I feel like when I bring this up to him, it hurts him. Maybe he feels rejected.\n\nI’ve attempted many times to explain that I just need some downtime, or that I have a low social battery. My social battery has grown so much since he and I started dating. I’ve asked if we could text, or if we could roleplay.\n\nI’ve asked about roleplaying, and he’ll say that he wants to but he won’t post back to me. If I post again, he gives no indication that he’s even read it. He feels totally uninterested in that aspect of our relationship now, when it was once one of the things that made us both feel close to each other.\n\nWhen we do just text, he won’t really tell me things. So when I ask about his day, I get “Good” through text then later on the phone, he launches into the actual details. I know he’s tired and busy, but the way he saves everything for phone calls makes me feel shut out of his day. I want to feel included again in his life even if it is only in the small ways.\n\nWhen he was going to work so early, I was really harping on him to send me good morning/goodnight messages. With him working that early, we didn’t get to talk at all. I felt really distant from him, and it was hard on both of us.\n\nI thought good morning/goodnight messages might open a line of communication between us. As I mentioned, I’m autistic, and that change in his schedule really rocked my world. For a year, his schedule was set in stone, and we had our little rituals. All of that got disrupted. Little to no of those rituals have returned since that shift. I feel like we lost a lot of the little things that made us feel like us.\n\nWith some pestering, he *did* start the good morning/goodnight messages. They often feel flat and I know he wouldn't be doing it if I hadn't have asked for it. But now he just seems really unhappy whenever we’re texting, and now it’s built into this huge thing in my head.\n\nThings have been rocky for like three months now. Am I wrong for craving texting still? How do I bring back the spark? I’ve tried to excite him with dirty text messages, but often those go unnoticed for a long time too, and it hurts my feelings.\n\nI don’t think he’s doing any of this on purpose, but I also don’t think he understands why it bothers me so much. I think to him, being on the phone is just better, and he doesn’t understand how it *wouldn’t* be that way for everyone.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nI feel like I’ve really worked on compromising. I’ve worked on being better at communicating on the phone. I’ve worked on asking to call first more often and on managing being on for so long. Part of me really wishes he would notice that and put more effort into some of the things I’ve been asking from him.\n\nWe’ve been fighting more and more, and I’m honestly very afraid of losing him. He is great in so many ways, but this one issue has really been slowly building into a bigger and bigger one. It’s seeped into every aspect of our relationship. Our sex life has truly died as well.\n\nAs I mentioned in my original post, I’m still fairly new to Reddit. I decided to take that post down so I could rewrite and include some more details that I felt were important. I’m also reposting from a throwaway account because the last thing I want is for my boyfriend to come across it and feel hurt or embarrassed. My goal here really is to just get advice and perspective from others who might be dealing with something similar on our situation, not to make him feel bad in anyway. Any advice would be more than welcomed.

We’ve known each other for nearly 3 years and got to making things official. Things were going fine until we had a conversation abt potentially meeting up and sleeping together. It was then disclosed that I was a virgin and she was not. I frankly didn’t care as sex is a part of life. But it was then explained the time stamp in which it occurred. She had met with someone else a month before we confessed to each other. Which is still fine to me. There was in a sense no exclusivity or mutual feelings between us. But then it was clarified that even after our confession she continued said relationship for at least a month after. I know that we technically weren’t in a relationship but a sense of betrayal felt apparent. She had known this person for less than a week when everything went down and frankly it doesn’t align with what she said the importance of sex meant to her among other things she told me abt. She also said that she knew she liked me for much longer prior so even though I didn’t mention that I liked her she in a sense knew and still went. She held on to this information for 10-11 months before disclosing it with me. But at that she never even came to me abt it and more so I got it out of her. I’ve been trying to come to terms with it and I’ve no ill intent towards either of them but my trust feels it’s been shot down a good amount. There’s a lack in authenticity and consistency which I told her prior smth I valued a lot. She claims she regrets her actions which I respect and am grateful she came forward, but at the same time it feels she just pushed what we had to the side. I felt forgotten and almost like a second fiddle. And all I can think about is why? It hurts especially as I would work a lot and free up time to chat with her and all for her to talk back as if nothing was happening. She initially planned on telling me when we met in December. But that would have been after hundreds of dollars, time spent driving, and meeting of friends and family. I’m feeling hurt confused disappointed and so much more but I’m not mad at her. I’ve decided that I love her and am willing to continue but am also open to the possibility that things could end. It’s also apparent that if things r to continue changes will have to be made. At the end I decided that I need some time to myself to process everything and to see if I can even go back to being in a happy and trusting relationship. Being lied to for a year really did a number on me and the continuation of such an action after feelings became expressed and mutual was even worse. All this to say, I’m wondering if this is normal to feel or if I’m justified in feeling this way. Or maybe even what next steps could occur. I’m still processing everything and am going to take at least 3 days to myself but no more than a month. Some insight would be appreciated. I love her but I’m hurt so bad and just don’t know anymore.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I just need to let this out because I’ve been crying for days and the pain is too much already. \n\nAs the title says, my LDR boyfriend ghosted me. \n\nWe haven’t been together for a long time but my feelings for him were real and deep. \n\nWe spent 10 straight days together before he left to work to another country. \n\nWhen we were together in person, everything was perfect. He was so sweet, kind, loving and everything I wanted in a guy. He was literally my dream guy. Everything just felt right when I was with him. \n\nWe even have the same birthdays and we have a lot of coincidences. \n\nSo I thought he was the guy for me already. \n\nWhen he left for another country, our communication was so bad. It takes him hours to reply because he said he was busy. \nWe barely even called each other too.\n\nI’ve communicated with him that I don’t like it when he disappears for hours without me having 0 knowledge about what he’s doing. I told him to just tell me if he was gonna be busy and I would 100% understand it. \n\nThen just last week, he disappeared again for hours. I talked to him about it and he said sorry and asked for another chance. He promised he wouldn’t do that again and it would be the last time I would bring it up. That’s another thing I liked about him is that he was easy to talk to and we were immediately able to fix the problem. \n\nThen just a day before our 1st monthsary, he was taking hours to reply again. I was a bit upset too the day before since he didn’t tell me that he was going to someone’s house after disappearing again. He just told me when he was there already. \n\nI asked if he can make some time to call me. He said “I’ll try. I have to wake up early tom” because it was his first day at work. I asked what time he needed to sleep and if cant call earlier. \n\nAnd that was the last time I heard from him. \n\nI followed up the same night to ask if he still has time to call and he didn’t respond. I sent him a long message at 12 am on our monthsary to greet him and wish him luck on his first day. No response at all.\n\nI also sent him a gift and I think he was able to receive it but still no response. \n\nI tried to call and text him to tell him if he wanted some space he could just tell me\n\nNo response at all and he didn’t even bother opening my messages. \n\nI’m really just so hurt right now. I’ve been crying for days and it’s killing me inside how I don’t have any closure. \n\nI was preparing also to get a visa so I can visit him the next few months. I was also looking into studying in the country where he is so we can be near each other but all of that went down the drain. \n\nI feel so worthless and my self-esteem hit rock bottom already. \n\nWas I not worth it enough that he can’t even explain why he vanished? Was I being too needy? Was I not understanding enough? Did he get sick of me? \n\nAll these thoughts have been circling in my brain the past few days and it’s killing me. I’m not getting enough sleep, I also lost my appetite, I have no motivation to do anything, I’ve been crying most of the time when I’m awake. \n\nI’m trying to push and to distract myself but I can’t do it. I just end up crying again. Even when I’m with my friends, I just can’t stop crying. I know there are a million other people there but I just can’t get over it cos I have no closure and I’m stuck in the “what ifs” and “maybe i should have done this”\n\nI know we haven’t been together for long (1 month as bf/gf and a few months dating) but my feelings for him were deep and real. \n\nEverything just hurts so bad. Idk what else to do. \n\nThank u for taking the time to read this. \n\nCan you please give me some supportive messages please.

To simplify this crazy situation as much as possible, let's call him A. A is a very good friend of B, one of my childhood friends. They met through work. In 2022, B and I travelled to Turkey for work and I met A, who lives there for work.\n\nWe were both in relationships at the time, so nothing happened, but we got on really well. A and I kept in regular contact, we often texted each other, he came to see B and me when he was passing through Paris and I did the same when we were passing through Turkey. This year, the texts with A became more frequent and the content of our discussions more intense. We were both coming out of difficult breakups, and our already intense friendship took on a new dimension. We talked about a lot of personal things, and A confided in B that he was afraid of messing everything up because I ‘am not like other women’. At the same time, I learned that he had confided in B that he had had a crush on me since the first day we met three years ago.\n\nI went back to Turkey alone this summer for work again and saw A several times. We ended up sleeping together and it was particularly good, according to both of us. The next day, we couldn't let go of each other, we walked around Istanbul all day, but I had an early flight back the day after.\n\nSince then, our exchanges have been heated. I know from B that he has the same expectations in a relationship as I do: something serious, stable, etc. As I've known him for three years, I know he's a gentle, kind, consistent bloke, so he ticks quite a few boxes. He sends me lovely things every day and tells me we need to see each other again as soon as possible. I'm due to go back to Turkey in November on business, so that works out well. In his messages, he is passionate. I can feel the intensity of our friendly exchanges AND a desire/love that has clearly been largely repressed for two years, so it's quite touching.\n\nI have to come to terms with two things: on the one hand, the fact that our friendship is turning into a romantic relationship, which is nice in itself. On the other hand, my pragmatic side is taking over: how do we deal with the distance?\n\nWe have the financial means to see each other, but that doesn't erase the distance. I want to give this relationship a chance because it seems obvious to both of us, and it's the first time this has happened to me, but anyway. He is a Franco-German journalist currently assigned to the Istanbul desk. He used to live in Hamburg but gave up his flat there. I'm an engineer based in Paris, and I've thought about looking for work in Istanbul because I'm at a stage where I need a temporary change, so why not spend a year or two abroad? BUT it's not a decision to be taken lightly.\n\nWhat do you think? How should I proceed?\n\nI don't want to pressure him, it's only been 10 days (yes, really), but as I'm already thinking about the logistics, I think it's better to talk as soon as possible about what we expect and how we're going to do it.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts!

I was struggling heavily with grief about 2 weeks ago and while the \"grieving\" portion has subsided, I am still struggling with my overall mental health. I'm sleeping in strange blocks of time, trying to hold down a very busy job (I'm in a leadership role which my boss has acknowledged has been impacted by business changes so I am under a lot of pressure and having to work extra however my contract is salary and requires \"reasonable overtime\". The expectation + lack of instant reward is adding a lot of stress/pressure. My boss usually rewards me with a bonus at Christmas though so I don't want to ruin the working relationship by asking for a reward now LOL)\n2. My partner agreed to move out to me long term before we ever got too serious and even now alludes to doing that but we have no \"end date\" because he has no timeline. He says he wants certain things for our future but doesn't \"plan\" in the same way I do. He said he will keep me updated with his progress but in the last 2 months I haven't seen any progress (we have been talking for 1.5 years and first met in May this year). I have told him that this doesn't make me feel secure about my future but I genuinely feel like him agreeing to keep me updated was his way of trying to comfort me / his idea of a reasonable compromise. The whole thing is adding to my anxiety and I don't want to be a butthole about it. (Does anyone else not have a general idea of the end date? I genuinely see this as a pattern of his personality and not intentionally dismissive etc). \n3. Because of my high anxiety / depression at the moment I am exhausted in general and struggling to show up in the relationship. Most days I don't even feel like talking. I don't want to get out of bed. But it's not isolated to my romantic rlationship alone. I'm not seeing my friends or family either and am struggling to even get to work. I'm doing my best to consistently remain in contact with them because I know its necessary to keep this thing going - I want to be with this person - I just don't want to do LDR right now. \n4. When I visit they want to introduce me to all their friends and family which I think is really reasonable but for some reason I'm focusing on that now and on the fact that I couldn't do that NOW. I'm concerned the feeling won't go away and I might need to postpone. I'm not in the right mental frame of mind for meeting all these new people and it all feels so heavy. \n\nThe visit is awhile away yet so I don't know whether to see how I feel closer to the event (this is what my parents think I should do) or whether I should tell him now so he feels prepared if I do need to postpone the trip? How can I tell him without coming off as a selfish, catastrophising, victim?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She lives in Belarus and I live in Belgium. The war with Ukraine-Russia had just started a few months ago, also I had left my job during this time, so financially I wasn't good. All these reasons in combination with the distance made it very hard for me to meet her, she couldn't visit me neither, because she needed a visa to be able to leave her country, she didn't have it. So I decided to treat her more like a very close friend.\n\nDuring our first year, I didn't tell her that I loved her, because I believed in real love, so I wanted to use it just once for the special woman and I could say it only after meeting her physically just once I thought, because I wanted to be sure that we loved each other physically the same as much as we did mentally.\n\nDuring this period, I would often tell her that I like her, that I miss her and that I want to visit her and I told her the reasons why I couldn't visit her. We were waiting for the war to stop, which never happened.\n\nAfter a year and a few months later, one day (on october 2023) she suddenly told me that she met a colleague at work and that she likes him very much. She left me to be with him.\n\nI became extremely depressed. I would often message her through instagram/whatsapp and tell her why I couldn't visit her.\n\nFast forward in April 2024, so after about 6 months she messaged back after I wrote her that she has a vacation soon and that we could meet and it would be the start of our relationship or the end.\n\nI became very happy. She told me that the colleague that she left me for, left her too. He stopped messaging her  and later he found another girl and left his job in the meantime. She told me that they didn't have sex, they just dated and she wanted to be with him but he didn't. We met on 9 may 2024, only for 3 days. Because she had a small vacation. But we had an amazing time together. We spend a lot of time together. We where walking togerher, hugging, kissing and much more more. We were very happy together. When we said goodbye to each other at the airport, we hugged and kissed each other so much\n\nWhen we returned home, we would tell how much we miss each other, how much we love each other and such. I've written her many beautiful and romantic messages about how much I love her. She told mr that I was her happiness, that I was her miracle, that her heart beats only for me, that she couldn't live without me. I felt the same.\n\nFast forward to 5 months and half later, on 1 november 2024, she suddenly told me that she's very depressed and that she needs time alone. I talked to her once and I asked why she felt that way, she told me because she's tired of everything... and that she's suffering very much.\n\nShe told me later that she wanted to freeze our happiness and continue our relationship when she would move to Europe (she wanted to focus on her job to move to Poland), so that we would be not separated (with the distance/war). She later replied that she misses me very much too and she's trying to come to Europe to be with me.\n\nI often would write her messages on instagram and she sometimes replied with \"I miss you too, very much\" with a heart emoji.\n\nOn june 2025, after 8 months since our breakup, she wrote me that she appreciates me a lot and that she loves me as a friend or brother.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I was in shock.\n\nI thought she was working hard to come to Poland and continue our relationship. I didn't expect this.\n\nShe also wrote later that I need to live without her.\n\nIt's been a month and I still feel devastated. I try to forget her everyday, I don't write to her anymore. I just still can't believe this. 3 years of very close friendship and real love relationship is gone just like that. We were soulmates.

I just wanted to share something and maybe get some advice. I’ve never had a conversation with a foreigner before. I’ve only ever chatted with two people online and both were Filipino. So when someone messaged me from Malta (he’s 25 and I’m 18), I didn’t really pay much attention at first. I didn’t take it seriously because I know things like that usually don’t last, especially when it’s online and long distance.\n\nBut we’ve been talking for over a month now and honestly that’s already a first for me. What’s strange is that he’s incredibly kind. It almost feels too good to be true. It’s like he came straight out of a book with the way he thinks and expresses himself. I know it’s the bare minimum but I’m also aware how rare it is to find a guy like him. His opinions amaze me and he never hesitates to sincerely apologize when he knows he’s wrong. He’s expressive, very vocal about his feelings for me, but he didn’t say “I love you” too early. He said it’s something sacred and he wants our connection to grow deeper before saying it. He’s never disrespected me, never brought up any sexual topics, and never asked for selfies. He already knows what I look like since we met on Instagram.\n\nOne time he asked if we could do a video call but I said no because I’m really uncomfortable with that, even with people I know. He respected it and never brought it up again. He sends voice notes, gives updates through videos, and when I asked about his past, he said he only had one ex and that relationship was also long distance so they never met in person.\n\nHe’s really kind, sincere, and consistent. But even with all that I know I shouldn’t fully trust someone I only met online. The thing is, I’m getting attached. The longer we talk, the harder it is to let go. He even said he’s willing to come here after he graduates which is in one to two years, and that he wants to introduce me to his parents someday if I’m open to it.\n\nSo now I feel stuck.

Should I stay or go?\n\nHi strangers , first reddit post ever, hope I can get some insight into how other people would feel about My situation.\nI 28(M) have been dating a lady 29 (F) for about 2 years she has a son from a previous relationship (4) who is charming but is a child at the end of the day and that comes with its own complications.\nOur relationship  was off the back of being good friends. We have been dating long distance for just almost  a year and things went from great to not so great.\nWe are both of African descent , but now live and work in different parts of the UK. She is kind, thoughtful, selfless ( a bit too selfless because it leaves her exhausted and stretched because she says yes to everything). She has been a great friend , and a great gf .\nIssues started when we both started dating long distance, we barely got time to hang out and talk. We are both in very demanding jobs, and having a child on top of all this doesn’t help. To compensate for this, I would travel to see her, or pay for her flights to come see me. Some times the flights are really expensive (up to £300) but she doesn’t chip in. (It’s something to do with our dynamic as Africans and gender roles, having to think about her child care costs and just life. I have brought it up in conversation but we still dont have a conclusion and I dont see a solution.\nShe is constantly doing things outside her capacity to accommodate people and some times at the expense of quality time for the both of us. It’s frustrating but I try to accommodate that.\nDiscussions on things we need to work on dont go well. They often start with her ignoring me till I probe about what is going on. Or , I have to initiate these and often have to delicately state the subject otherwise she will be quite emotional, and we wont have any resolution. I often feel like I have to end up compromising.\nLastly, and I hate to admit it. Between looking after her mostly lovely child, work , and the distance, we dont have time for each other anymore. And it’s taking a toll on everything. We went from talking very often to barely talking.\nShe is also going through some disappointments at work (office politics and all) and it’s really gotten her distant and I’m left without my friend . When we talk its really just venting and trying to work through her emotions.\nI am trying to be understanding, but I feel like the relationship is really struggling, I have extended of myself for a while now financially , physically, and emotionally and I dont know how much longer it would have to go if I dont have what I crave most, the companionship. I feel alone and quite frankly so does she. Outside of moving back to her city, there is not much I can do. I left the city she works to seek more career opportunities and growth, and we both knew it was a good move for me.\nWe dont want to move in before marriage , but as Africans, there is a lotttt to consider there, between massive family demands from the girls side, and the financial costs of actually making it happen, we both realised we cannot really pull something off in the short run especially financially.\nI dont know if we can make it work for long, but I also dont know if I would be giving up too soon. If we ended things we would both be devastated , but we are both struggling to make it work and I dont know if I can go another year like this.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Others are intrigued by the novelty of dating someone from a different culture or background, thus start looking for a partner online.\n\nThere are also those who seem more comfortable connecting from a distance—whether out of fear of commitment, social anxiety, or simply because it feels safer and more manageable than traditional relationships.\n\nI'm curious—what's your reason?

{"id": "u/CourseInteresting570_565", "user": "u/CourseInteresting570", "text": "LDR of 15 months,lied about my entire life (finances,family, academics) and just sent him a full confession\n\nI (19F) feel like a total mess and the anxiety is finally pushing me over the edge. I think I’ve figured out why I'm so restless and always want to break up with him: I’ve lied about practically everything, and I’m confused about what's real anymore.\nWhen we first got together, I saw this as just for fun. Seriously, I thought I’d block him(20M)in a few days. But we got so much further, and here we are.\n\nThe Lie,The Pressure, and The Person I Became :\n\nWhen we started dating, I only showed him my good parts, never my flaws. We were so busy fighting and fixing things that I never found the right time to open up. By the time I realized I should tell him, it felt too late. I was terrified I'd embarrass myself and ruin the perfect image he had of me. I thought he’d stop loving the version of me he knew. It all started because he was the kind of person who made fun of others' insecurities, labeling it as dark humor. I've never been overly sensitive, but since I liked him, I became extra conscious. I felt this pressure to only show him the best side of me. Since it was online, I didn't really have to worry about being exposed, lol. I didn't realize it at first, but soon, pretending to be this perfect person became my whole personality. Instead of getting better in real life, I was working overtime on portraying perfection. It was a stupid decision, but whatever.\n\nThe Whole Truth : \n\nNow, I need to come clean about my history, because he (and you guys) deserve the whole truth. Yes, I was a bright student until 9th grade. But then came 10th grade. I got major depression,not chronic stress I was pretending to look cool about, but constant darkness and suicidal thoughts 24/7 for over nine months. Tears dried up. Four or five belts (slaps) and 10 curses a day was the mandate, and the rest of the time was spent sleeping on the floor in 42-degree heat without a fan. Unsurprisingly, I passed with only 51%. I honestly didn't study a single thing. After that, I spent a whole year on bed rest and didn't study again. The financial stuff is the biggest lie. He used to brag about his dad being a government employee, which led to me spinning this huge lie that,my dad was successful and financially stable,Ugh, I’m so embarrassing. My dad is an asshole who loves to sleep, rots in bed, and procrastinates all week. He lost all his money and businesses and has spent his entire life abusing everyone around him. This is why when my boyfriend says, \"You know your capabilities and how far you can go,\" he scares me,he reminds me of my dad. We live in a small, backward village because my dad can't afford a shelter of our own. He's jobless and somehow manages the rashan(rations), lol. We live in one small, congested, shitty room. We don't even have a kitchen and own absolutely no property. We have no money in the bank and no future security. Imagine having three daughters under this leaking ceiling, and he has loans he hasn't paid. We had to leave Delhi only because we were getting death threats for not paying a loan on time. We're living on the last money from selling inherited land. Once it's gone, we are fucked. Our school fees haven't been paid since last year. Meri soach k gend ftt rhi (My mind is blown) lmao.\n\nThe Present Failure : \n\nThe room I’m living in now? My mom paid for it by selling the **last piece of gold** she had. She wants me to help her and my sister get out of this shitty position. But lol, here I am. I failed 11th grade with 16% because I was busy with online flirting, GCs, and yes, texting my boyfriend and masturbating. I haven't attended school for more than 25 days this year. I haven't completed any syllabus, don't know a damn thing about my subjects, and I'm not even trying. I'm just texting him, feeling low, and then pretending to study in front of her. I know this is a pretty fucked-up personality. But yeah, this is who I am. I condensed all of that into a long, messy text and sent it to him tonight.\nI'm posting this because I can't breathe. What should I do now? Was sending that text the worst decision? Do I wait for him to leave, or is there any chance I can prove to him that I'm ready to fix my life and myself?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Eventually, I decided to stop doing it altogether so I could focus on resting, errands, and just not stressing about being caught.\n\nAt first, he said he understood again. But since then, he sometimes makes comments that make me feel guilty about my decision.

Hi Reddit, m(25) living in Latam m(28) living in Japan. We started our relationship when he first came to Latam and I felt in love so much that we never stopped talking (January 2025). After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year. I love him so much and hurts me to think that I won’t be able to see him and kiss him ever again, but I feel that I don’t deserve that kind of love and I would give everything of me and even get in debt to spend time with him 💔.

Or Am I [F31] overthinking it?\n\nI met this guy [M33] in early August while I was traveling and we spent about a week together when I was in his area. After our week together, he mentioned that he doesn’t want to go on other dates and pursue other women so I said okay. \n \nSo ever since we met, we have been in touch for the past two months texting throughout the days and having Zoom calls almost every day. We don’t live in the same place (6-hour flight apart) but we have been planning to meet for a week in late October again (but nothing booked yet). \n \nNevertheless, yesterday, things seemed a bit strange from my perspective. He usually works on Fridays but told me yesterday that he had the day off. We messaged throughout the morning and early afternoon and he seemed driving and doing errands. I asked him what his plan is for Friday evening and he said: “I just bought a new shirt and maybe in the evening I will just go have a pizza” (4:30pm his time). We messaged a bit and then later at 5pm his time, he sent me this (and I was away from my phone):\n5:00pm “Time for a call but I have to move to the dinner “my name””\n5:00pm [Missed call - he tried to call me but I was away from my phone]\n5:25pm: Sends me a selfie wearing a jacked and shirt (and this outfit was different than the one he was wearing in the morning)\n \nI didn’t check my phone until just few minutes after his last message and saw that he tried to call me (which is strange because he never does that. He always messages me if I was up for a call an hour in advance and then I send him a Zoom link). I then sent him a message “Want to call?” But it was left unread and he didn’t open WhatsApp until three hours later. \n \nI felt very strange and had a weird feeling during these hours because:\n(1) He suddenly disappeared\n(2) He was being vague with his plans. Usually when he goes out with friends, he still checks his phone and send me messages/photos of dinner, friends etc but this time he mentioned that “it was him going out for pizza” alone?\n(3) He gave me a call on WhatsApp at 5pm and it was strange because he never does that. It seems that he knew in advance that he wouldn’t be able to call me or text me later during these three hours and he was hoping he would talk to me right before he goes in and “disappears” \n \nThree hours later at 8:30pm his time, he came back and sent me these messages:\n“[calls my name]”\n“My internet connection is not good”\n“:(“\n“Strange”\n“I’m now walking home but it is so strange that there was no internet”\n-Sends a screenshot of him attempting to message me earlier when he was [assumingly at the restaurant] but WhatsApp wasn’t loading for him/his 5G wasn’t working at the restaurant-\n“I am now at home”\n“But it was really strange”\n \nOverall, I felt it was strange that he had no internet in the restaurant. So his 5G wasn’t working inside the restaurant? He could still have asked if the restaurant had WiFi. Also, if he wasn’t able to use his phone at all during these three hours, so he was just having a dinner by himself for three hours? I find that strange. I go out to dinners by myself alone but even if my phone wasn’t working, it usually doesn’t take me three hours as I get bored just sitting by myself.\n \nThe reason why I find that suspicious is because I know that in phones it’s possible to manually disable the internet connection to WhatsApp or any other app specifically and then he could send me a screenshot that his messages weren’t being delivered to me. \n \nLater when he got home, he sent me more messages and (cheap <100$ per night) hotel suggestions for our October trip and I didn’t even bother checking my phone and didn’t reply to anything because I just felt confused and upset.

Hi Reddit, m(25) living in Latam m(28) living in Japan. We started our relationship when he first came to Latam and I felt in love so much that we never stopped talking (January 2025). After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year. I love him so much and hurts me to think that I won’t be able to see him and kiss him ever again, but I feel that I don’t deserve that kind of love and I would give everything of me and even get in debt to spend time with him 💔.

I’m considering getting a divorce.\n\nMy husband and I are a long distance couple, we met here on Reddit while being in different countries and our relationship has mostly transpired at a distance (continents and time zones away). We have been together for almost two years and decided to get married two months ago.\n\nRecently, he came to the country I’m currently residing in for two weeks. Everything was ok, we had some disagreements but we worked through them. He’s always been the most patient and sweetest man to me. Since yesterday night was his last night here and I know how much he wanted to play board games and socialize, I invited the classmates from my postgrad program to my shared apartment to play games and drink.\n\nMy husband began drinking immediately and by the end of the night he had basically drank about 70% of all the alcohol by himself. I have seen him drink and hold his alcohol before so I trusted he knew his limits. However, last night I saw a version of him I have never seen and it has truly scared me. \n\nHe began being loud and slurring, then he said he wanted to go to a bar but since my friends were leaving and his flight requires us to be up early in the morning, I told him I don’t think it was happening. At around this time, one of my friends who had already left called me terrified and told me that a guy had followed her and was harassing her and that she’ll send me her location because she was extremely scared. I told her ok and offered to send a taxi if she needed for her to come back here but she said it was ok and a girl she saw on the street was helping her get home. \n\nI began putting away and cleaning the mess in the apartment while checking my friend’s live location. At this time, I noticed my husband putting on his shoes. I intercepted him at the door and asked where he was going and he said to the bar and I asked him if he was going alone and he asked if I to come with to which I replied no because we have to be up early tomorrow and he hadn’t even taken the keys and it’s dangerous to go out at this time. Then he went back into my bedroom while I cleaned and I thought everything would be ok, but then I saw him head out. After realizing it was too quiet while I tidied up I realized he had left the apartment completely. Soon after, he called me and was being incoherent so I asked him where he was and why he left. At this point I began crying because he had taken the only set of keys I had and I felt terrified of going out to search for him alone without my keys (without a way to return home if I was in danger, especially after what my friend had told me had happened to her).\n\nHe continued being incoherent and this went as a back and forth when he didn’t want to tell me where he was or was too drunk to. He kept hanging up and while that was happening I was also getting updates from my friend so I missed a couple of his calls. I called him back once more and he asked me WHAT DO YOU WANT? So I hung up. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to do, I called one of my classmates who also lives in this building and asked her for her keys because I wanted to go out looking for my husband. I was terrified for him because he had taken his phone, wallet and passport with him as well as the keys. Without hesitation, she and another classmate came over and offered to go out with me to search for him. \n\nThe three of us went out and sure enough there were guys in the street who catcalled and tried talking to us, we ignored them but honestly I felt extremely grateful for them being there with me in this situation. I was on the phone with my husband trying to get him to describe where he was but he was truly not making sense at all and I began to get frustrated, so one of my classmates offered to take the phone from me and try talking to him. She did and after walking for around 15 minutes we saw him stumbling in the middle of the street. We went to him and he immediately collapsed on the floor. \n\nHe laid there for a while, while we tried to wake him up and put him on his side. One of my friends went to get a glass of water and at this time a few passerbys had stopped to ask if everything was ok since it was a weird scene I guess: three women trying to move a guy on his side in the middle of the sidewalk at midnight on a weekday. We managed to get him awake and sitting up and tried giving him the water but he kept spitting it, so then we tried to get him up and moving towards the apartment building. My classmates were incredible, they helped hoist him up and pull him and help him walk (he was mostly shuffling while we carried his weight).\n\nDuring this time, he kept asking my friends where they were from and trying to talk to people on the street. He asked a group of guys if they had penises and also tried to talk to a homeless guy who was on the floor. We kept trying to keep him from engaging with people because he was being obnoxious. Then, he kept talking loudly to one of my classmates, he stopped and tried to grab her wrists while talking loudly to her. I saw her get visibly uncomfortable and I stepped in and told him hey please stop trying to grab her, don’t grab her like that. He looked at me and asked if I was mad and I just told him let’s keep walking. He then pushed me, not too hard but I did stumble. My friends told him not to be mean to me like that because I’m just worried for him and we’re just trying to get him home. He then said hey (my name) fuck off. It took every bit of me not to cry at that moment. I was already feeling extremely embarrassed about how he had been acting and about him trying to grab my friend and screaming at people in the street, but this was too much. \n\nWe continued walking and he screamed his head off on the way, shouting incoherent things. As we approached the building where I live, my husband suddenly took off running and we had to run after him, then he tried to pee at the door of the building and I had to stop him. There were police near the building and I wanted to avoid him getting arrested. We got him inside the building and he collapsed in the lobby in front of the elevators. We got him up and moving and then when we reached our floor he ran again towards the very end of the hall and again tried to pee. Again I had to run after him and literally shove his zipper back up again. I got him to the apartment and he entered my room and closed the door. I was left to thank my friends and say goodbye.\n\nI was afraid of what I would find in my room, but when I got in he was just passed out on my bed snoring. He briefly lifted his head when he sat me enter and said you don’t care about me. I hid behind my closet and sobbed for a few minutes wondering what the hell did I get myself into. This has been one of the most embarrassing and stressful experiences of my entire life. I can’t stop thinking that if it hadn’t been for my friends, I would probably still be out there without a key and a means to come home, exposed to who know what dangers, roaming the streets of the city searching for this man. I am terrified. \n\nI have to mention I also just underwent an invasive medical procedure which required me to not do physically exerting activities for a week or two and he knew this and still he had no qualms putting me in this situation. I have realized through this and other situations that this man doesn’t have any regard or compassion towards me at all. When he woke up after throwing up all over my floor, he dismissed what he did and said it was all easily solvable. He watched me almost puke all over myself while cleaning his disgusting puke off my floor. Yesterday night I didn’t sleep at all because of this and I felt the cramping this has caused on the area I was operated on throughout the day. I don’t think he understands how deeply this has altered the image I had of him, he is exactly like my father used to be with my mother and and that terrifies me. I am seriously considering getting a divorce soon.

He’s very successful, and financially well-off, while I’m about to turn 25 and start my own career. From the very beginning, he’s been incredibly attentive — constant calls and texts, thoughtful little gifts and snacks, virtual movie nights, and sweet compliments. He calls me his queen, tells me I’m everything to him, and I genuinely feel cared for and happy.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I’d like some perspective on:\n\n•The speed of the relationship: He told me he loves me about 2 months in. He’s already talking about marriage and children and is planning to fly to my country soon to meet my parents and formally ask their permission.\n\n•His sexual openness: He sometimes asks me for pictures, and when I send him regular outfit selfies, he’ll tell me he masturbated to them. I don’t know if this is common behavior for men or if it’s too much too soon.\n\n•His past relationships: His most recent ex is a celebrity from our home country who has publicly shared that she was raped by another rapper before she dated him. Our country unfortunately has a high HIV/AIDS rate, which has made me a bit anxious about sexual health in general. I’d like to ask him to get tested before we become physical, but I’m nervous about how to bring it up respectfully.\n\n•Dating history & preferences: He avoids the subject when I ask how many women he’s been with, which makes me think it might be a lot. He’s mentioned he usually prefers curvier women, and all of his exes look nothing like me — I’m quite slim. He’s also made comments about younger women being “better” and said he’s always wanted a “trophy wife.”\n\n•Appearance-related comments: I have light brown hair that can look golden in the sun, but he insists I’m blonde and says he’s always wanted a blonde wife. I know he means it as a compliment, but it sometimes makes me feel like I don’t measure up to this ideal image he has in his head.\n\nOverall, he treats me very well, and I do feel happy with him — but I also want to make sure I’m not getting swept up in something that’s moving too quickly.\n\nQuestions I’d love advice on:\n\nIs this kind of intensity normal in new, long-distance relationships, or does it sound like love bombing?\n\nHow can I bring up the topic of sexual health and testing without making it uncomfortable?\n\nHow do I know if I should slow things down, and what’s a healthy pace for a relationship like this?\n\nAre his comments about younger women, curvier women, and “trophy wives” harmless preferences, or should I be concerned about how he views women?\n\nHow do I keep my insecurities in check when he compares me (even indirectly) to his ideal “type”?\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts and any practical advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I know I have an avoidant attachment but overall it’s not easy cuz I get triggered and scared easily and he’s been really stressed mainly over me. I feel anytime I speak up it’s going to stress him out and that’s how it was in my last relationship so I just ended it. I already know how this ends and I’d rather not wait to see it so forget it.

I’m looking for other ways to bring in a little extra money. I can draw—I’ve done cartoony pet portraits and some t-shirt designs. I tried selling shirts on one of those print-on-demand sites before, but couldn’t get it going. Does anyone know good platforms where I could sell designs or pet portraits? Also, if anyone has tips on how to find cheaper international flights, that would help a ton. I’ve never traveled before (so I’m nervous), but I know I’ll be safe with her.

My girlfriend lives in Austin and I'm up in Minneapolis, been together about 10 months now. She always talks about her best friend Cindy who she's known since high school and how supportive Cindy has been about our relationship.\n\nWell last week Cindy found my Instagram (I guess my gf tagged me in something) and started following me. No big deal right? But then she started liking literally every single post I've ever made going back like 2 years. Then she started commenting stuff like \"so handsome 😍\" and \"your gf is so lucky\" with the heart eyes emoji.\n\nYesterday she straight up DM'd me saying she was \"just checking in\" and asking how things are going with the distance and if I ever get lonely. When I didn't respond she sent another message saying she \"understands what I'm going through\" because she was in an LDR before and \"knows how hard it can be.\"\n\nThe whole thing feels super inappropriate but I don't want to cause drama between my girlfriend and her best friend. My gf already stresses about the distance sometimes and I don't want to make it worse. But I also feel like I should tell her what's happening??\n\nI have some money aside from a Stаke win that I want to use for plane tickets to visit next month and this Cindy situation is just adding extra stress I don't need.

{"id": "u/Slow-Hat1748_599", "user": "u/Slow-Hat1748", "text": "I (21/M) feel unwanted by my girlfriend (22/F) in our 9-month LDR\n\nHi Reddit, this is my last resort. I don’t have close friends to talk to about this, and I’m honestly at a breaking point. I (21/M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (22/F) for almost nine months. She’s my first serious relationship and I love her deeply, but when it comes to intimacy, I feel constantly confused, undesired, and hurt.\n\nShe has depression and started medication two or three months before we met. Early in the relationship, she was flirty, gave signs that she liked me, and spoke about intimacy in ways that made me feel wanted. A few months in, she told me she had made out with another guy at her gym. At that time, we had met in person a couple of times, but she hadn’t done that with me yet. Hearing it crushed me. I felt jealous, inadequate, and like I wasn’t enough. We fought, cried a lot, and eventually I forgave her because I saw her efforts before that incident. But it left a lasting scar.\n\nSince then, our physical intimacy has been limited. We cuddle, kiss, and hug, and she sometimes initiates affection. On calls, she tells me she misses me and wants to cuddle. So she’s not cold or distant. But when it comes to deeper sexual intimacy, it feels like I’m always the one initiating or asking for things she did naturally with others in her past. There have been a few times when I confronted her directly, crying and expressing my insecurities, asking why she refuses to be more intimate, and after those emotional conversations, we did have moments of intimacy. These moments happened a handful of times, but only after I pushed or after emotional breakdowns. Most of the time, if I try to engage without that buildup, she refuses or responds minimally.\n\nShe has said that the medication affects her libido and mood. She has suggested trying things like sexting or masturbating together, and we’ve had conversations about exploring each other’s needs. But almost every time, these ideas don’t turn into real follow-through. I will initiate flirtation or intimacy, and the most I usually get is a giggle, a small “thank you” or “mmm,” and then the moment dies or she falls asleep. This leaves me feeling rejected, inadequate, and like I’m constantly asking for something that should come naturally.\n\nRecently, I accidentally saw her browser history and realized she watches porn. That discovery hurt even more. It made me feel like she has sexual energy, but she doesn’t share it with me. I haven’t told her I know, but it’s added to my insecurities.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling unwanted, unattractive, and constantly comparing myself to her past. She has told me stories about making out with guys who turned out to be assholes, and I can’t help but feel jealous that she was more physically forward with them than with me, the person who loves her and treats her well. At the same time, she does show affection in other ways, so I’m stuck between feeling loved and feeling undesired.\n\nI don’t want to shame her for having depression or being on medication, and I don’t want to pressure her. But I also don’t want to spend the relationship feeling like a second choice or constantly inadequate. I’m struggling to reconcile my love for her with the hurt and insecurity I feel. I keep overthinking and feeling undesired even though she reassures me that we’ll try things and figure stuff out.\n\nI used ChatGPT to help frame my thoughts, so please don’t mind my phrasing English isn’t my first language. I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has perspective on how to handle intimacy challenges in an LDR where one partner has low libido due to medication, depression, or past experiences.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nI (21/M) am in a 9-month LDR with my girlfriend (22/F) who has depression and started meds before we met. Early on she was flirty, but now she rarely initiates sexual intimacy and I feel undesired. She made out with another guy early in the relationship, which left me insecure, and recently I found out she watches porn, making me feel worse. I’m always the one initiating intimacy, and the few moments of deeper intimacy usually only happen after emotional breakdowns or serious confrontation. She suggests trying things like sexting or masturbating together but rarely follows through. I love her but feel inadequate and unwanted. I’d appreciate perspective from anyone who has navigated similar challenges in an LDR.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I’m pretty much stuck in a situationship. He told me about 6 months ago that if we were to be together it would take maybe 1-2 years because he was unsure of where he’s at in his life or what to do with it. He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me. So I’m genuinely confused by all of this. \n\nNow he’s apologised and said he’s giving me time and space to figure out what I want and where I want to go from here which has really confused me because I’ve always been open about how I feel about him and that I wanted to meet him in person and see if we could start a relationship which is something at the start of us talking, he was open to but now he’s completely against it. He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. I don’t really know how to speak to him again. I miss him like crazy, I felt like we had some kind of bond and he agreed but now he’s switched up completely, he even says he never misses people so I guess I’ll fall into the category. \n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute he acts as if we are in a committed relationship i.e we made an agreement not to do anything sexual or even touch ourselves unless we were both doing it, things like that which hint to being in a relationship then I ask him what we are or talk about my feelings and he shuts it down. He tells me he does genuinely care about me and everything else and part of me believes in his own way he does but right now I feel like I’ve wasted 9 months but at the same time I haven’t really because he’s helped me through a lot of shit at the same time - I feel attached to him but I don’t think it’s necessarily a good attachment.\n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me. My head is a mess with the overthinking. He doesn’t want me but doesn’t want me to go?

{"id": "u/ohawhatsthat_609", "user": "u/ohawhatsthat", "text": "Anxiety about closing the gap and how to make it work (Germany - UK)\n\nI’ve had these thoughts for a while, sometimes they just creep up and are made worse by my anxiety, but in general this is what I think about a lot. \n\nI am in Germany, my partner is in the UK. We are the same age but he’s so much further in life: living alone, bought his own place, car, has a good job, a good social circle. I feel like I am so behind, everything he has, I don’t have. \n\nGenerally it would be easier for me to move to him, I speak his language while he doesn’t speak mine, I don’t really have anything holding me here except for my family and even that I’m fine with leaving, as harsh as that sounds. And in general, I think life in the UK would be better for me than life for him in Germany. \n\nWe’ve been together for six months and we have had conversations about closing the gap etc. but I feel that we have very different view points on how this is going to work out, like our timelines are not matching. He thinks it’s as easy as just applying to jobs, getting a skilled worker visa, and I’m set. \n\nI’m doing my driving license now, something that he pushed for which I appreciate to have his support on, I would have liked to move out and live on my own first, preferably in a different city in my country, find a new job here to gain more experience before seriously applying to the UK, because I can’t just apply for “funsies, memes and yolo” like him. I want to put effort into it so I have the best chance of actually getting accepted. How it’s going to work there is another question and issue, like getting to London since he lives in a different city and I don’t think I’ll find a job in my field there, but that’s an issue that can be solved. \n\nI told him from the beginning that closing the gap for real would be at least another year, most likely longer. I know it sucks and i also want it to happen sooner but how is this going to work? Right now I’m doing the license, that’s at least another 2-3 months until I have it, another few until I’m actually very confident in driving alone. Then it’s looking for a job and place to live here, which I don’t want to leave after only a year. I mean, leaving a job after a year that’s fine whatever, but the apartment won’t even be done within a year and I wouldn’t want to move after such a short time and waste all that money. Even if I do leave after a year, that’s still at least another year and a half until I can seriously think about going to the UK. Of course I could also apply to places in the UK at the same time, but with my current CV and experience I highly doubt it’s going to go anywhere. I got really fucked by covid unfortunately and I’ve been trying to gain more work experience and show that I can do stuff, but there’s still doubt in my mind about it. \n\nPlease don’t misunderstand, I love him and I want to be with him. Maybe it’s just my anxiety about everything in general, maybe he’s right and it’s not as big of a deal as I make it to be. If we were in the same country, I would leave everything behind and move to him. If the UK was still in the EU it would also be easier but as it is now, it is not easy for me.\n\nThere is also something to be said about his family. We haven’t met yet but from what he tells me, his parents wanted him to end up with an Indian girl, marry, have kids, etc. and most of all, they want him / us to have a plan.

Of course I want to marry him, kids I am very much on the fence about, but how am I supposed to give him a plan of our life when I don’t even know what next week is going to look like? \n\nWe visit every 6-8 weeks and spend at least a week together in person, we even had our first vacation together recently, video call every day, even when he’s traveling and the time difference is huge. We still make it work. Of course I want our visits to turn into our everyday lives but I just don’t know how to do it right now. \n\nNow, this is completely just my anxiety talking because he hasn’t given me any indication like pulling away, talking less etc. but I’m scared I will lose him. We are best friends and we love each other, how we make each other feel and express our gratitude for each other every day. But I can’t say that I would blame him if he left, I know that my anxiety and me in general can be a lot to handle and I hate that I am putting him through this. I know there are couples who have been together for years before closing the gap and they made it work too. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like when I bring it up, it usually leads to him disagreeing (in a sweet and kind way, but disagreeing nonetheless) because his brain just works differently, which he also already acknowledged as well. \n\nAre there any encouraging insights from people who have been doing this a long time or have already closed the gap?

Neither of us were looking for love, but our initial connection went beyond friendship and now we have been talking about a real future together. We do get on video calls often, and he has seen pictures of me. For reference, I am approx 250 lbs and 5 foot 6. I have told him that I am heavier than I look in pics and on cam, and he says there is no issue with that at all but he has been with a woman as large as me. As of today, we both confessed that we are falling in love but we are both afraid that the connection we have now will be different when we meet in person, but he is planning a trip to come and see me next month to find out how real this is.\n\nWhen on cam or in pics, I VERY MILDLY edit them so that I don't have bags under my eyes or dark spots on my skin - but I do NOT change my facial structure or put fake make up filters on or any of that catfishy stuff. I simply wanted to present myself in the best light possible for him while we were getting to know each other. When we are on cam, I never stand up to show him my belly because I am ashamed of it. I am currently losing weight, but I have a very long way to go. My largest fear is that he will see me in person and will not be attracted to me without the limited perspectives he has been shown up to this point. He says he is aware that bodies change as we age and that my weight may go up or down but he is attracted to me for who and what I am, not what my body looks like because he has not met me in person, nor has he seen a full body pic of me. I want him to know what he will be coming overseas for, and I want him to see all of my imperfections before he buys his non-refundable ticket. I am terrified that when I do, he will no longer want me and I will lose him. I am afraid that all of this connection we believe we have will vanish if I am not exactly what he has built me up to be in his mind by filling in the blanks with rose colored glasses.\n\nOur connection feels so strong and we are such excellent communicators that I honestly feel like he is my person, the one I wasn't looking for but was always destined to find. He says he looks at me and sees his wife. I can't bear the thought of him rejecting me because I wasn't 100% transparent about my physical beauty. \n\nDo you think that our connection can be enough for him to still love me, even if I am not as good looking as he imagined me to be? Is what I am doing a form of deception or lie? Should I send him full body pics and just see what happens? I haven't ever felt like this about someone and I am terrified that it may all come crashing down. Please help because I am having panic attacks and I feel like maybe I should just end it before I waste any more of his time.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We haven’t spent time/spoken in a while, and he feels like i deserve more. He feels lonely because of the distance, and with everything happening feels like he needs less on his plate. We were seriously ending things, then called and ended up not breaking up. We don’t want to split but i want what’s best for him. Currently not able to see each other due to financial issues on both ends. Unsure what to do.\n\napologies for the essay, i tried to summarize it as much as i could\n\nWe met online through a video game (i had just turned 19, he was 18 for a few months, born in same year), and we never intended to have something online, but we truly fell for each other. We had our ups and downs, doubts here and there, but we have not once broken up. We’ve only taken one break for about 2-3 weeks(both tried to not text the other), but have stayed together because we want something serious.\n\nNow to the issue- we haven’t really spoken too much or really spent that much time together or even spoken much/called in a month- a month and a half, and i figured he wanted more space and just didn’t know it (thought this because that was the reasoning for the previous break, he was under a lot of stress). But he came to me saying that he thinks we should end things, he’s under a lot of pressure from family issues, financial issues, personal issues, and it hurts him that i can’t be there to comfort him. \n\nHe said he wishes i was there because he wants physical touch, and for someone to comfort him. That it hurts him because he misses me so much but he can’t even hold me (it’s been a problem in the past). And with everything going on with him he feels like he needs less off his plate, just so he doesn’t have to worry about it as much.\n\nHe feels as though he’s not good enough for me, as i value quality time, and there’s been a few times where i had gotten upset because we wouldn’t spend as much time together. He feels like he’s holding me back from finding someone better, but i always told him that despite everything he’s a good guy and genuinely treats me well, and a bunch of things i love about him that makes him better than others. Even during arguments he has never called me names or said terrible things.\n\nAs much as i hated the idea of losing him (we are really attached to each other) i chose to respect his decision and even though i wanted to beg him to stay, i decided not to. He told me this over text, and he sounded serious about it. He said even though we are broken up, we’ll still have each others phone numbers to text each other every now and then, because he can’t imagine just throwing me away and never talking to me again. So i asked him if we could call for the last time before we do.\n\nAt first he sounded sure about it all, but after everything he said he had a “wtf am i doing” moment, and realized he doesn’t want to lose me. He doesn’t want to end things, if anything take a break, but he still doesn’t want to do that. I’m still not 100% sure where he stands, we planned to talk about it later today too. At the end of the call it sounded like we weren’t splitting up, we went from crying to even laughing a little. Hearing my voice again apparently reminded him that what we have is real and genuine.\n\nThing is, i genuinely don’t want to lose him. I love him with all my heart. I can’t imagine my life without him because he’s such an important part of my day, even when we barely talk. But i thought about if he’s constantly worrying about me/us, it might not be the best thing for him. He says he genuinely loves me and i always will have a special place in his heart. And as much as it hurts me i want the best for him. Even when it sounded like we were done he truly wanted what was best for me, he wanted me to do things to help myself.\n\nCurrently because of everything we haven’t been able to see each other. We are both struggling financially and simply don’t have the money to see each other, although we really want to. I offered to contribute to his flight and hotel and maybe even pay for one or the both fully when im able to, but he doesn’t feel like i should be paying for everything, because he wants to be able to do things together and buy me stuff/spoil me (we “fight” about this lol, i want to spoil him too).\n\nI thought about a few options:\n-break up completely, which seems really scary and extreme\n\n-taking a break until one of us either can’t take it, or is ready to make a decision if we stay or separate \n\n-taking a break until his situation is better\n\n-slightly limit contact, maybe video call once 1-2 weeks to update each other, and so we can see each others faces/hear our voices more regularly and to remember what we have\n \n-keep somewhat our current situation and text when we feel like it, so we don’t feel alone\n\nwhat should we do? i’ve thought about bringing up option 4 to him, but i would like to hear other people’s opinions or other possible choices", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I made a post on here a little while ago explaining some of my situation and I’ve tried communicating but nothing much has changed\n\nIm tired and I feel like I don’t deserve the way he’s treating me, I love him with all my heart and I like to think I treat him as such but part of me thinks that I deserve better and that he’s “holding me back,” as shitty as that sounds and believe me I really do feel guilty for thinking that way but I can’t help it.\n\nEverything has been different ever since he confessed to me in July that he had a crush on another boy, I was heartbroken and I cried for 10 hours straight that day, I hesitated to tell him but I did tell him and it felt like he had no remorse. When he told me he had a crush on that boy he said he “only liked him but didn’t love him the way he loved me”, we talked and I was upset but willing to work through it with him, mostly because of how devastated I was in the moment and how badly I didn’t want to lose him. He told me they only knew each other for a month but “he’s been sending me cute videos and I feel guilty for rejecting him” which honestly leads me to believe he was emotionally cheating on me, even now it still hurts so badly to think about it and I’ve been having reoccurring dreams of him leaving and cheating on me.\n\nI begged him to stay and not leave me for that boy until he turned it back onto me and said I couldn’t be what he needed, that I wasn’t bold enough and didn’t show him the love he wanted or needed, so we went on a “break” because in his words, “I don’t want to see him or you right now”. There’s too much to go over but eventually we got back together.\n\nFast-forward a month, he joined this minecraft game server where he was being flirted with. He invited me to the sever and I was annoyed with the flirting and didn’t like it so I told him, he said it was a joke and in his words again, “this is why I was afraid to invite you, because you take things too seriously. even things\nlike this, I want to be allowed to joke around too” so I let him, he’s russian and so are all his friends so I couldn’t understand what they were saying but I translated it and he was denying that we were together. I left the game after the flirting got too much and since he was ignoring me too, later a screenshot was shown to me of that conversation.\n\nHe urged me to leave the server and completely stop playing so I did and I can only assume the flirting continued but I told myself, “what I don’t know can’t hurt me” and kept living like that. Up until now, he barely texts me, I send him paragraphs about how much I love him, I send him cute videos, I try to be more “bold and brazen” like he wants me to, but nothing seems good enough for him and im\ntired. I invest too much effort into him and this relationship just to get basically nothing back, when actually does respond to something I send he’s dry and uninterested yet I see him posting in his telegram channel and playing with his friends meanwhile I have to beg for even an ounce of attention.\n\nI just need help I want us to work out. We’ve been together since August 14, 2024 and it feels like I’ve made so many exceptions for him and let so many things slide that he would have never let slide for me.

{"id": "u/CandyTemporary7074_645", "user": "u/CandyTemporary7074", "text": "Two years after breakup. These lessons changed me completely.\n\nIt has been almost two years since the day my relationship ended. I still remember sitting on the floor of my apartment that night with my phone in my hand waiting for a message that never came. I replayed every detail in my head like I was trying to rewrite the ending. Every corner of the city felt haunted. Even the songs I used to love felt poisoned.\n\nAround that time I watched my favorite Rohmer movie *Conte d’hiver*. The way the main character held onto love with almost spiritual devotion hit me hard. That was me. My love had become an obsession, almost like a religion. Regret turned into a daily ritual. I analyzed every moment like scripture, asking myself what I had done wrong. It consumed me. But over time that obsession started to shape me. It didn’t just hurt, it forced me to rebuild my life piece by piece and become a better version of myself.\n\nI learned that heartbreak is real pain, not just in your mind. Neuroscience shows rejection activates the same brain areas as physical injury. That’s why my chest felt like it was tearing open every morning. Guy Winch’s TED Talk on emotional first aid reminded me to treat a broken heart like a broken bone. I stopped pretending I was fine. I cried when I needed to, journaled when the noise got loud, and reached out to friends instead of isolating. That honesty became the first step in healing.\n\nSelf-compassion became my anchor. Kristin Neff’s work showed that people who treat themselves kindly recover faster. At first it felt fake to tell myself “you are doing your best.” But slowly it worked. The shame eased. Writing also became medicine. I wrote short entries about values I wanted to carry forward and red flags I ignored. That turned regret into a plan instead of a prison.\n\nSleep nearly broke me. My nights were restless until I tried Andrew Huberman’s simple tools, morning sunlight, physiological sighs, and non-sleep deep rest. Movement and light helped reset my body. Learning about oxytocin and dopamine explained why I felt like I was going through withdrawal. It wasn’t weakness. It was biology. That realization made it easier to replace the old bond with new routines like working out, volunteering, and building friendships.\n\nBooks & podcasts became my teachers. Attached by Amir Levine is a bestseller that made me rethink how I show up in relationships. This book will make you question everything you think you know about love. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk is the best healing book I’ve ever read. It shows how the body stores grief and gives tools to release it. Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin podcast made me feel less alone listening to couples work through real struggles. Huberman Lab gave me science I could actually apply to my sleep and mood. The School of Life YouTube channel offered short bursts of philosophy that kept me grounded when I was tempted to spiral. And a friend pushed me toward daily expressive journaling. That practice helped me turn obsession into lessons I could use. Also my friend recommended me BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It takes books, expert talks, and research and turns them into personalized podcasts. You choose the length and even the host’s voice. I picked a smoky Samantha-from-Her style voice that made the episodes feel intimate. One session blended Esther Perel’s interviews, Gottman Institute research, and neuroscience on bonding. It explained why I was still reaching for my phone at midnight and gave me concrete steps to break the cycle. Reading helped me more than therapy ever did. Honestly. \n\nAttachment theory also gave me clarity. Esther Perel’s talks made me see how my anxious tendencies shaped the relationship. I began practicing “secure” behaviors like setting boundaries and being direct. For the first time I realized regret could be fuel instead of a chain.\n\nAlmost two years later the pain is no longer sharp. What started as obsession has shaped me into someone stronger, clearer, and more secure. I don’t carry the loss like a religion anymore. I’m ready to say goodbye.

I really like this girl (F, mid-20s) and don’t want to lose her.\n\nBut I’ve noticed some patterns from my past that are creating problems now:\n\nWhen I get angry or emotional, I sometimes say things I don’t mean. I raise my voice or argue instead of staying calm. Later, I regret it.\n\nTo make up for it, I send her long, emotional messages to explain my feelings — but she doesn’t like them. She says things like “please grow up, stop dragging things” and that I sound childish.\n\nShe gets upset when I repeat the same concerns, and sometimes she cuts the call or raises her voice back. This makes me spiral into self-doubt and overthinking.\n\nI genuinely want to change. I know these are bad habits from my past relationship, but I don’t know how to break them. I love her and want this to work, but right now it feels like the more I try to “fix things” with big emotional texts, the more frustrated she gets.\n\nSo I need help:\n\n1. How do I control my anger and not blurt things out in the heat of the moment?\n\n2. How can I express my feelings without writing long messages that overwhelm her?\n\n3.

She likes girls as well and we've been non-stop chatting ever since, and I think we have great chemistry. We haven't talked about anything regarding the nature of our relationship asides from friendship but Im pretty sure its a mutual feeling (i hope, otherwise this will sound silly😣) Im in the US east coast and she's in France. I really REALLY REALLY like her but im worried there are too many roadblocks for a potential relationship to work. We're both in college, I cant imagine moving to France and shes expressed how she cant envision a life outside of France. If the relationship did grow to be serious then I could imagine moving maybe but I cannot imagine life without my best friend. She isnt just a friend she's my other half, and I cant imagine moving away from her (saying this seems silly but I assure you we are literally joined at the hip and have been for many years). Me and my bsf have so many milestones we want to accomplish together and that cant happen if im in France. I also worry because im currently taking prerequisites for a medical profession that doesn't exist in France, not to mention i would have to learn the language to work there properly (im not against it but it would take time!). Her career is also based in france and although she speaks english well im not sure how the job market would be for her here. She's also talked about a past long distance relationship and how she didnt think she'd be able to do it again but she keeps flirting?

{"id": "u/IndependentRub5727_657", "user": "u/IndependentRub5727", "text": "AM I BEING CRAZY OR NOT?\n\nLONG READ PLEASE HELP- I am in a long distance relationship with a guy. I truly feel like he is my soulmate. We are best friends and have so much fun together. I have anxious attachment and he has taught me so much in the process. But, we just now made things serious. He has talked to my son on the phone and we officially started dating/ he was skeptical at first but he wanted to make sure we were solid before he even spoke to him and told him see you thanksgiving! It was a slow burn and we took things slow. He will be coming to see and meet my family during thanksgiving. I met him organically and it’s like we just clicked. We have both healed parts of eachother. He is a avoidant attachment and at first pushed me away multiple times. He was in a dark place. I was the first person that made him feel safe. I looked through his phone/ he literally spoke to no one and had one friend. We had some issues with communication but once I told him what I needed from him he calls me everyday. He also is taking 6 classes in a masters program and is packed. We talk alot about the future and our plans. He finally met some new friends and there was a incident where he went to this girls house with his friends and while they were there a girl made a comment that made everyone uncomfortable because the girl had a boyfriend. He still chose to stay when his friend left leaving just him and the girl to go the bar as friends because they both have significant others he didn’t see a big deal because we trust eachother/ the girls boyfriend was pissed, he FaceTimed me and I tried to act chill but then things took a turn and the girl ended up trying to do stuff with him, she didn’t make it obvious but she knew what she was doing and he explained he had to get out of the situation because this was her first time drinking he FaceTimed me the whole night the girl even talked to me on FT but wouldn’t let him leave this was his first time hanging with her as they all met in class , but after that incident I told him that’s a boundary my man should never be alone drinking with a girl regardless???? So, we moved past that. He did FaceTime me the whole night and the girl just wouldn’t leave him alone she was 21 and now they don’t speak to her. Then there was an incident where he was on FaceTime with me and his friend called and said look what that girl sent me (he said the girls name from that night) and said to me remember that crazy bitch? I said yeah. and sent him a screen shot and he said I’m gonna call you back and I said no what’s the picture? His friend said a big booty girl and I said I’m going to bed. He started to blow my phone up, and was wanting to know why I was upset. He said is it cause he said her name and big booty girl? I said no what am I upset about? And then I acted like that’s what it was and he let out a gasp of relief and said wooh I thought it was something else, he just talks sometimes. So then he goes on later to say to me I need to be honest and I can’t lie to you, the picture he sent was where the crazy girls friend said that my boyfriend was cute and to see if he was interested he said he just didn’t want me worried about another girl. So fast forward to yesterday he calls me every night he said he’s at his friends cousins house for her birthday. He calls me at the birthday and I said you have fun I’m going to sleep he says why are u in a rush to get off the phone? He tells me he’s going home at 12. Fast forward he never goes home, he’s at the bar and then ends up back their house and stays the night. It’s his friend and his fiance and her cousin. The next day I told him it’s a boundary I don’t want my man to stay the night anywhere. He also mentioned the finance and her husband are so toxic and that when the husband wasn’t looking the finance was being friendly with my man. So today he reassures me that it won’t do anything that’s gonna bother me and that he understands and that it’s not what it seems it’s just college friends drinking and then crashing at their place. But he understands my boundary and said if it’s bothering me he wouldn’t do it. At this point I’m lowkey checked out he calls me and says I’m feeling anxious and just wanted to hear your voice idk why and then we talked about it again and he said why do u give me ultimatums and I said it’s boundaries. So then he FaceTimes me before the beach party and says I’ve noticed the past couple days you haven’t really been talking to me , you’ve been very short. He explains that they were great host ( his friends cousin and his wife and her cousin) and he said tonight after the beach party they are prolly gonna stay there or at his house because they are gonna drink and his friend doesn’t need to drive then goes on to explain that I’m overthinking and the situation is nothing like I think it is and he’s not gonna say he has to go home because his girlfriend is insecure and he said I should trust him and he should trust me and that I’m overthinking and that this is the problem with long distance and he said they are great hosts and you don’t find good people like that these days but also last night was talking about how literally the guy and his finance hit eachother and that the fianace tried to grab my man’s arm at the bar and was being really friendly.  He says we should trust eachother and that I’m overthinking it and it’s not like that and that he’s gonna FaceTime me tonight and he will show me everything and keep me updated.

{"id": "u/LivingProfessional59_666", "user": "u/LivingProfessional59", "text": "My boyfriend [22M] never compliments me [21F] and has been like this since the start of the relationship\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend doesn’t call me beautiful or compliment me at all. I have low self esteem so slowly it’s chipped away at my confidence. I was a woman who used to take loads of selfies, but now I don’t because I hate the way that I look. And I’ve felt like this for 3 months now. Him and I have been together since this May and we’re in a long distance relationship (uk to Australia). \n\nI’m not a happy person anymore. I do have clinical depression which is managed under medication but my symptoms seem to be getting more pronounced and severe. I’m not smiling anymore and I feel more apathetic towards everything. \n\n\nFor example during sex he doesn’t like bodily fluids. During sex, he doesn’t try and arouse me. He just focuses on his own pleasure. When I asked him to try and get me off he said he doesn’t like bodily fluids. And washed his hands immediately. When we’re also on video call, sometimes I get naked, after he finishes he told me once to get dressed straight after. I told him does he know what after care is? Because when he said that it made me feel uncomfortable, cheap and unloved. \nDuring sex he asks me to put my hair down because it turns him on more when I do that but I told him no since my hair normally is very dry thick and coarse and gets matted very easily so it doesn’t look nice when you bring it down. \n \nHe never compliments me. I always have to ask for a compliment. He asked me did my previous boyfriend for example give me a lot of validation. I said yes. And he said I need to be more confident but I already have low self esteem after years of bullying through secondary school and sixth form. \n\nI have some sexual kinks. He called it dark and twisted and said that it’s not normal to have kinks like that. Since then I’ve never showed him what kinks I’m into. Also for about 2 months now I’ve felt uncomfortable watching porn with my kinks in it. So in that regards I haven’t watched porn for 2 months.\n\nThe reason for that is that for me watching porn made me imagine myself in the place of the girl, however my love for my boyfriend deepened significantly and I can’t see him ever performing the acts that I’m into in porn. I now believe it is dark and twisted too. I also haven’t masturbated in 3 weeks as well. \n\nPut too much makeup on and calls me vain \nHe says he prefers my natural face and my face with makeup on is too heavy. When I was on holiday with him, I was talking pictures of my outfit, he then called me vain and said I need to tone it down. I don’t take pictures anymore as much. When I went to see him in Sydney, we did some exploring, I would take tons of pics of him. He would ask if I wanted any pictures and I would refuse because I felt ugly because he doesn’t compliment me at all. \n\n\n\n\nBleaching skin \nI have started bleaching my skin since I’ve been with him, because I think I’m too dark. \n\nOne night he said he doesn’t see a future with me. We basically tried to imagine where we’d be in 5 years and I wasn’t in his world in 5 years. I felt angry that I travelled all the way to Sydney Australia to see him and then he would say that to me. He later said that I need to get over it. \n\nHe told me he’s not sure if he sees a future with me even though I travelled all the way from the uk to Sydney to see him. \n\nAnyways to conclude at first being with him was magical. But going to uni, working and balancing a 9 hour time difference has proved to be a challenge. I don’t want to give up on our relationship, I’ve invested quite a lot now. He also come from a home where compliments are not shared or affection.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I (26F) met Jay (28M) through a common friend after I visited their country due to a business trip on February. On May-June I went back to his country, we went on 6 dates which were very special to both of us -or so I thought. He asked me to visit his country again, that I could stay over at his appartment for as long as I wanted to -he said I could stay for a few months, even. We were going steady since June, having weekly calls, sexting, sending pictures, chatting everyday. 4 weeks ago I called him to discuss our expectations with my trip visiting him and we agreed we were on the same page: we would be intimate emotionally and physically, we would go on dates, and overall just enjoy the moment, not necessarily getting serious.\n\nYesterday, I arrived and saw a few red flags: he's not picking me at the airport and he didn't even get to the car when I got there to his building. Then, at his appartement, he's not kissing me, hugging me, anything. Physical thouch is at zero. We spent the day together like this, me feeling awkward because why is he pushing away? \n\nI took the bravery to ask him about his behavior. He said he's seeing another girl since 3 weeks ago. He apologized for not telling me sooner, but his expectations changed radically after going on some dates with her. He just wants to remain friends, and for me that would have beeen okay if he told me previously and not 3 hours after landing in his country. He said he really would like to have intimacy with me, but his consciousness doesn't let him because of his feelings for this chick. I just feel terribly sad and broken right now. Even though my intentions were not romantic, I feel humiliated and stupid. He has insisted that I can stay with him but i don't feel comfortable anymore. \n\nAfter that conversation, we made the mistake of getting some drinks and getting tipsy. We said a lot of passive-aggressive/flirty comments, and that was just putting salt on the wound. Today he went to a hike with this girl (he even invited me to join them) and hasn't said anything. Idk if it's important (at least it kinda is for me), he said they haven't even kissed. I told him I don't feel comfortable staying in a bed were he's gonna fuck her after the hike while I do my plans. He reassured me that it wasn't a possibility because they haven't even kissed. He said he wants to ask her about them and if she's not into him, he'll go right up with me because I'm the \"best hookup\" he's ever had. Idk, I feel too bad, I need some advice or anything, really. \n\nThank you, redditors.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I said I’d wait.

[20F & 22M]\n\nMe \\[20f\\] and my partner \\[22m\\] are going through hardship. Our emotional connection is quite up and down. We have moments in time where we feel close and connected. We have moments where we feel less. We've been having a lot of hard conversations, especially with me talking to him about my needs and how I feel loved. We've had talks about saying true to his word. There was a situation where he stated that he would come over that night, and he didn't and this was the third night in a row. Obviously, I was completely upset over that because we are a long-distance couple and I was in his state, roughly 15 minutes away from him, staying with a friend at the time with a private room but I could understand his side, however it annoyed me due to the lack of being true to his word so I bought it up. He didn't need to come over but I just thought I would bring it up to him and we had a conversation about it, and we got McDonald's afterwards because it was quite an emotional conversation for him and I. I should also give some backstory. We've been dating for It's been six months now. We had a situation where he broke up with me due to him starting the ADF, Australian Defence Force. He thought our relationship couldn't do it, couldn't survive the Australian defense force, as he didn't know where his life was heading, and he was letting his overthinking get to him (his words). He cares about me a lot. He's committed to me. I'm committed to him. We love each other and we're having all these hard conversations about my sexual desire and attraction towards him. I feel that I want him, you know, pretty often. And he feels like he can't do it as much as I want and that's completely fine but we have run to a point where I'm starting to question the attraction and my understanding of it.\n\nUnfortunately, I was neglected as a child, so I have unfortunately had a unhealthy way of expressing my desire to be wanted through intimacy. I want to fix that by trying to lower my desire, and I am trying to explore therapy. But I want to know if, what way can, as a long-distance couple, can we connect besides desire, sexual desire and how we can connect more? We've been in a rhythm of playing video games, we've been in a rhythm of watching shows as well, and it's all the same stuff. Which I feel has burnt out, and it's not fun? anymore, it's kinda routine?. Which is completely fine, I know relationships go through hard patches, but I am very committed to this guy. We had a situation yesterday where I sent him an \"inspirational photo\" (I asked before I sent), and he said didn't feel the same way that he would normally. He said that it was attractive, and that it felt different because normally it would always be on his mind, and normally he would want to do something after that. But he didn't, and he brought it up to me and we had a conversation about it, and he felt that he was a bad partner as he feels he is having troubles with his consistency and he feels he owes so much to me for breaking up with me but I am trying to express to him that he is not a bad partner, and that it is okay but I also feel like I have said some wrong things when communicating because I feel sometimes my insecurities come out as well, and sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough because I always communicate openly to him about everything and because of that I feel like the amount of hard conversations we have had puts a lot of pressure on him, and I feel like I have caused him to feel this way and that hurts. I'm trying to just come to Reddit or any source that I can to get any, I guess, information or seek clarity, see what people did. He also expressed that when we were in person, he had some moments where it felt the same way. So I'm not too sure what to do. But he's also reassured me that he's never done anything with me like that where he didn't want to.\n\n\n\nWhat are your comments? Thoughts? Opinions?

Alongside with this situation, I brought up some other issues that I'd tried to discuss with him a lot of time ago but didn't yield any results, so basically, we've been almost constantly fighting since March. Or rather, he's been either avoiding me or apologising/saying what a bad person he is/saying I was right, and I've been trying to talk to him and eventually losing my patience and getting mad because all our conversations haven't led to anything at all. With his neglection, he made me go though a severe depression that lasted four months and almost made me develop an eat*ng d*sorder, as I was barely able to eat anything. Considering recent events, I think I'm just an inch from going back to this condition.\n\nOne of the issues that were raised was the plans for our future. Some explanation here too, so that it'd be more clear why it affects me so much: he's a EU citizen, he has a comfortable life, a kind, loving family, and an average job that he actually likes. I'm a poor girl from a third-world totalitarian country, I went through a huge lot because of my mother who mentally abused me my whole life, and the only reason why I have a place to live is because my only two friends who are a couple allowed me to stay with them in their apartment for some time. I can't afford anything to rent because of how high the prices are, and the only place I can go is a single bedroom apartment where my mother and sister live. I never had any other relationship, this is the first time for us both. He knows everything about my life and me, just in case. Before I started dating my boyfriend, the only plan I had in mind was to flee the country as soon as I graduated from university (I graduated last December), and then at least not end up homeless in an unfamiliar place, because I knew that I had no future and I didn't even dare to hope to once be able to rely on someone other than myself. To be completely honest, I was sure that my life would end up with a su*cide one way or another, because I knew that nobody cared about me and I didn't know if I'd be able to put up with this fact.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship, he'd say so many sweet words, he promised to marry me, that we'd live in our own house where I'd have my own room, which I've never had, that he'd do everything to make me feel the level of love and appreciation that I deserved. For the first time in my life I had hope to become a normal person, to have my own family, to feel loved and needed. But at the same time, I knew that given the drastic difference in our circumstances (and the fact that he wanted us to live in his country, where housing and job crisis is the main issue), we needed a plan. And me especially, because unlike him, I can't just live my best life with my family unbothered by the future. I made first attempts to talk about it last autumn, and he told me that yes, he wanted a future with me, but every time I tried to have this conversation, he suddenly seemed to be terse and distant. Eventually he said that we'd start discussing it after my graduation, so I agreed with him and thought that our second meeting in February would show us both how well we get along when we're physically together (and we actually do, much better than when we're long-distance, that's what marvels me). So I patiently waited right until March, and I have to admit, I really hoped that this time he'd be the one to start this conversation, because all the time before that it kind of felt like I was the only one who cared about it.\n\nWhen I brought up this issue in March, after the fight we initially had that I described in the beginning, we stopped mid-convesatiom, as he was feeling very sleepy and asked me to continue later. But 'later' didn't happen neither the following day, nor the week after that, which got me very upset and led to another fight, etc. During these reoccurring fights that'd happen between periods of him being distant/ghosting me, he told me that after all the times he hurt me, he was no longer sure that he'd be a good boyfriend for me. I tried to tell him that only he could change it and become the man he wanted to be for me, that all those fights meant nothing to me as long as we listened to each other and tried hard for our relationship. Then it turned out that he wasn't sure that we'd find a place to live or that we wouldn't eventually break up, that he was feeling responsible for my whole life, considering my circumstances. Again, I really tried to reassure him and to explain that he wasn't a messiah in my life, because I'm a grown up person that survived through a lot of things without him. Despite the fact that I felt extremely anxious about my own future, I agreed to wait for some time until we stop having fights and get our relationship back to normal, so that he could see things from a clear perspective.\n\nBy the end of July, we finally, finally seemed to talk like two normal people again, we even made plans to meet again and in August I applied for a visa to go to his country for Christmas and meet his family for the first time. But even so, I just couldn't get rid of this anxiety related to the future. It's been a long time since my graduation already, my friends are planning to sell their current apartment and buy a singe bedroom one instead, so I won't be able to stay with them forever. I mean, even if I had the same citizenship as him and was living across the street from him, I think it's a completely normal and necessary step to understand what expectations you should have of your relationship. Not to mention my situation. At the very least I wanted to know when we potentially could move in together and what we could do to achieve it, and with this final plan in my head, I'd be able to make my own smaller plans meanwhile. I'd know what to do and when to act. In addition to this, the news in my country doesn't get any better. It's gotten pretty dangerous and hard to live here, and it just keeps getting worse.\n\nSo at the very beginning of September, I saw another awful event happen, which got me really sad. He of course noticed it, and when I explained everything to him, I intentionally tried to avoid saying anything about him or our relationship. I knew he needed time and space in this regard, so I didn't want to pressure him, despite my own inner suffering. I only mentioned being anxious because my country was making it more and more unbearable to live here and that I didn't know what to do about my future. I mean, what was I supposed to say? Lie to him? He figured out that deep down I was feeling this way because of him too, so at first he told me that he felt useless because he didn't know how to help me in my circumstances, then he started ghosting me again, feeling ashamed apparently. I was the first one to make contact AGAIN and I tried to talk to him. Briefly, we had the following conversation (I'm sorry for basically retelling it, I just don't want to post these stupid screenshots like people often do here out of respect for his privacy):\nHim: Saying for the fifth time all those things about not being sure that we'd be able to make it financially, about being afraid of what'd happen to me if we broke up at some point after the marriage.\nMe: Thouroghly explaining to him that I wasn't trying to make him talk about our future right now, that I knew he needed some time and I was merely sharing with him what was bothering him. I also told that I wasn't a newborn child that'd die the second day after its parents abandoned it, so he shouldn't underestimate me when it comes to us potentially breaking up.\nHim: Out of this long message I sent him, he only responded to the last part, saying that he was the last person on earth to ever underestimate me.\nMe: Saying that then he shouldn't be worried about something that hadn't even happened yet and would hardly ever happen, because I was sure he was the love of my life.\n\nThat's it. It was September 8, and since then he's been simply ghosting me, having left my last message on read. I've been waiting for three weeks for him to say something, and considering that he daily checks in on our chat, he most likely waits for me to say something instead. Yesterday I lost my patience and told him that if that was the reason for his silence, he could keep waiting, because I was done being the first one to reach out all the time and I wasn't going to say anything else. I know that my actual wording perhaps was a bit rude, but I can't describe how humiliated and abandoned his actions make me feel.\n\nHe just read my message yesterday and hasn't replied anything to it since. I don't know if he's going to ever reply to me at all. I don't know if I should be the one to try and talk to him after all, because I'm really tired of doing it literally all the time. We haven't broken up, and at this point I don't know what will happen to our relationship, but I'm so lost and desperate right now. I know that some of you will probably say that he's a jerk and I shouldn't stay with him. Maybe you'll be right. But he's actually kind and smart, and like I said earlier, we don't fight at all when together physically, it all comes down to the fact that he has communication issues, especially when he can't see his interlocutors. And despite everything, I genuinely love him and I'm so afraid of being alone for the rest of my life. I'm only 24, but it feels like I spent more than 60 years on this planet already, I'm so, so tired of everything. I met this man by pure accident, and looking for close connections in your life is such a hard toil. I know I won't be able to survive through countless and countless attempts to find another person that I'll be able to love as much as I love him, even looking for new friends is so unbearably hard for me.\nMy boyfriend once told me that he suspected being autistic, and so many times I've tried to make him undergo an assessment, as I'm afraid that we both might be treating his issues wrong. I don't want to make a drastic mistake and mistreat him just to find out that at some point that I should've been more patient and chosen a different approach. At the very least I tried to persuade him to attend a regular therapist, and he agreed with me, he admits his mistakes every single time, but so far he haven't done anything at all, aside from agreeing with me and apologising. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know what's going on in his mind (and I've told him a lot of times to share with me in such situations). For the very first time I hoped to become a happy person, despite everything, but now I'm afraid to spend my whole life alone. I'm so scared of not feeling loved and needed by anyone, that's the worst thing someone can ever feel. I spent nearly my whole living like this, and I don't want to lose everything and get back to this desperation. With our relationship I managed to get out of it, but it seems like the day when I'll start feeling like a stray dog again is getting closer and closer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Do I just cut my losses and cancel?\n\nHi all, I (30f) am in the early stages of a relationship with a guy (33m) who lives in Canada, and I live in the UK. Some context - we met in 2023 while I was working abroad and he was on vacation visiting our mutual friend, who has since passed. He's handsome, and I think a little out of my league, if I'm honest. He hit me up when he was visiting family in my city in summer 2024, we really connected as friends and had spent some great days together, I was then in his city this summer and our relationship progressed. We started messaging and calling regularly when I returned home, and after a month or so of mostly consistent communication I booked to fly out to see him in October. Before doing this, we had a candid conversation about expectations, etc. and we were on the same page. This would be our first trip with the sole intention of seeing each other. Things were looking good, I was cautiously hopeful.\n\nNow, 3 weeks out from my trip, I think he's ghosting me. He's a busy guy, I trust that he is busier right now than he was when we decided I would come visit him, but since the beginning of this month I've barely heard from him. Last Tuesday I asked him if he still wanted me to come, he said yes and that he's just extremely busy at the moment, and I haven't heard from him since. It literally only occurred to me last night that he may actually be ghosting me, because the idea of him encouraging me to book an expensive flight to see him only to change his mind a few weeks out was truly not a situation I foresaw.\n\nI've looked at my options and I can change my flight date/destination, of course there will be a charge for this, but I'm okay spending that money to save a little self respect - not showing up in Canada only to feel like an inconvenience.\n\nMy question is: do I just change my flight and move on with my life as all of this is a massive red flag I could regret not listening to in the future? I expressed to him last tuesday that I'm feeling uneasy with the lack of communication and the proximity of my trip, so that's not a conversation I'm willing to have again. Do I just quietly call it quits and cut my losses? Or do I trust that he's just busy with work and his intentions are as he claims?\n\nPls, at this point all advice is welcome and I am losing my mind", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I can't be mad at my boyfriend who's pretty traditional (influence of his cultural background). I would never have settled for a guy ''like this'' (doesn't know neither want to learn how to cook, don't know anything about periods, woman owe their bodies to their man....). We didn't grew up with the same models, and it's hard to accept we don't think the same way. But it's also very open minding (if that's an expression haha, sorry English isn't my first language), he's ready to learn so I'm gladly teaching him. \n\nA year back, I would never have believed I would go out with someone that different. He really values family, marriage and even kids when I'm the total opposite.\n\nPlus, we live half the world apart (19 000+ km). I swore myself not to travel with a plane again (did it twice already) because it's highly non ecological. But distance hits hard, and the only thing I want is to meet him someday..I'm torn between my values and my heart in this situation haha.\n\nThird (and last) point is using screens a lot. I tried not to get intoxicated by TikTok, don't doom scroll, try to use screen as less as possible. But whenever I have time now, we write with my boyfriend, we plan on playing games and stream films together, and I catch myself grinning like an idiot while doom scrolling between cheesy insta réels about love. I feel bad for consuming always more internet and screens. But there are no other ways right ? \n\nI do feel guilty for being selfish and privileging love over values..did someone already felt this ? Obviously I adore my boyfriend and I wouldn't even think about leaving him.

After a few days considering, I decided to date him because I felt comfortable and enjoyed being with him. Now, I still like him but he disappoints me sometimes. We only talk on the phone during weekends for 2-3 hours (that’s if if both of us have the time). So we rely on texting during weekdays a lot.

He works online and only works during night time and during day time, he babysits his little sister only for a couple of hours, but he still can’t make time for me. He does text me from time to time but we’re not actually having a conversation, it was more of a “I’m doing XYZ” and nothing else, not a “how’s your day so far”, “what you up to”, etc. He did tell me before, that he finds texting not a way of spending time together and he feels bored if he has to constantly update. Despite all that, he still says he loves me and prefers calling instead. I understand him to a certain extent cause we’re in a LDR, not a normal relationship. I feel like if we can’t call, the bare minimum would be texting. At least that’s how I feel how LDR should work (correct me if I’m wrong). Moreover, I woke up today with no texts from him at all (no goodnight, updates, etc) which upset me a lot. This is my first time being in a LDR so I appreciate all your help.

We’ve only been official for a few weeks. We’ve already met in person before, but now we’re temporarily long-distance because I’m studying abroad and he’s working. He’s planning to visit me in about a month.\n\nHere’s the issue: when we do calls, it’s great — I feel really close to him and happy. But between calls, he barely texts. I’m the type who loves sending little things throughout the day, but he says he hates typing. I don’t need constant replies, I just don’t want him to suddenly disappear for hours or a whole day with nothing. That’s when I start overthinking and feeling drained.\n\nWhere I’m from, couples text a lot, even if it’s just something small, so it feels natural to me. I’ve noticed my Western classmates don’t really text much either, so maybe this is cultural? Or maybe we just have really different communication styles.\n\nI’d really appreciate advice — how do you handle this kind of mismatch in a relationship, especially early on? Any tips from people in cross-cultural or long-distance relationships?\n\nTL;DR: New LDR (<1 month). Calls are amazing, but texting is rare. I don’t expect constant replies, just not total silence.

We’ve been talking for 10 months now. I live in Europe he lives in the US. At the start of the year he told me if we were ever to be together it would take quite some time, maybe even 2 years… he’s at a point in his life where he doesn’t know what to do… whether to go back to university and get a masters degree, change career or move back home (he wasn’t born in the US). \n\nHe’s also aware that after I graduate my plans were to try and study in the US (I’ve always wanted to do this prior to meeting him, also to clarify, my intention isn’t just to date/talk to a guy from the US with the hopes of a green card before anyone suggests this). \n\nAnyway, recently he told me he’s not ready for a relationship and I’ve been pushing him towards one and it’s making him freak out as he’s only been divorced a few years (he told me he ended things). That he’s enjoying being single etc because he can focus on his happiness and he doesn’t have to be responsible for anyone else’s (I admit there’s times where I’ve been clingy wondering why he hasn’t responded or if he’s talking to other women) he told me he’s not looking for a relationship or talking to anyone else but if he was ready for one, I would be his only choice and that there’s nobody else.\n\nCut a long story short - I called his bluff, I told him I was going to start dating other guys and that we could be friends if he was open to that. He agreed but he was very distant afterwards, it ended up in an argument and I asked him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore and he said not if we’re arguing so I told him it’s best we don’t talk and he started asking if I was for real etc. \n\nBefore he told me he didn’t miss anyone and didn’t get easily emotionally attached to anyone, not even his ex wife which is why he left her. Weeks ago told me he rarely misses people as a response to me saying I missed him. After our argument and after I said it’s best we don’t talk he told me he thinks about me throughout his day and that he misses me and if I left he would miss me a lot and that he doesn’t want things to end. \n\nI feel like this is a big thing him finally opening up to me but still I have so much to decide upon, he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship but treats it like we’re in one. Maybe I’m just too overbearing at times… I’ve been used to being lied to and cheated on that I don’t trust easily and sometimes when he goes quiet I will assume the worst. He told me he likes his own space and his ex wife never used to give him that which is part of the reason he doesn’t want a relationship.\n\nI don’t know if he will change his mind and I’m probably dumb for waiting around but after our argument I feel like I need him in my life. I hate not having him because he always gives the best advice, he’s supportive (not very emotional) but he seems to understand me - a lot of people don’t.\n\nTL:DR LDR/situationship told me he thinks about me throughout the day - not sure this means much but I found it sweet. He also told me he misses me and would miss me if we didn’t talk.

We’ve been talking on and off for about a year. He told me beforehand that he’d be working during the day, so I spent most of the time at home with his mom and siblings (who were all wonderful). His family was amazing and welcoming, but I’m naturally a shy person, so I was a little nervous.\n\nOne of his siblings shared that he went through something tough recently that made him close up in a shell. That helped me understand him more, but I still struggled with how things went while I was there. He’d come home from work tired, which I completely get, but sometimes he wouldn’t eat dinner and I’d end up eating with his family. Other times he’d go to the gym or play video games while I just waited around.\nWhen we did spend time together, it was mostly in his room watching movies, which I didn’t mind. But on the few occasions we went out, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was just rushing through it so he could go back home and stay in his room. He was really excited to see me and was telling me about all the places he wanted to take me to. He seems different from the last time he came to visit me. He was distant and not as affectionate as before. \n\nI really care about him, but I’m feeling unsure about where things stand. On one hand, I understand he’s tired and more of a homebody, but on the other, I was visiting to spend time with him and it felt like he wasn’t very present or enthusiastic. I traveled to see him and thought we’d spend more quality time together. I don’t know if I should bring this up to him, let it slide, or take it as a red flag.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?

{"id": "u/jijisil_727", "user": "u/jijisil", "text": "I thought I found my soulmate but now I'm thinking it might not work..\n\nFor context, I (21F) have been talking to/dating a guy (20M) long-distance for a few months. We met in person while he was in my city visiting family and after we exchanged contacts, we instantly clicked. He lives in a different state, and being broke and busy uni students we only have the chance to see each other in person during semester breaks. \n\nHere's the thing. I really, really like him. I think he's an amazing, unique person who happens to insanely click with me on our interests and core values (for the most part). This was to the point where I thought it genuinely was fate that I met someone like him, that he was my soulmate. Pretty naive, I know, but keep in mind being the shy, passive person I am, I've never been in a serious romantic relationship before. In the first month or so of knowing each other, we talked non-stop. I was reserved at the beginning and conscious of moving too fast, but he dove straight in, showering me with compliments and promises and what have you. Naturally, this died down after a month or so, and I appreciated that he would apologise for and be communicative about it. I didn't hold that against him, we were both getting insanely busy. \n\nHe'd told me he was coming up to my city again this month, so we made plans for a proper date early on. He said he would plan the whole thing and keep it a surprise, and the way he went on about it made it seem like it would be this grand gesture. Of course, with all of the fuss he made, I got pretty excited for it. The day came and I got dressed up, I made him a gift and I waited for him. The date itself was nice, and I was so happy to see him that I didn't mind how plain it was. Even then, though, it was underwhelming. He'd gotten too busy to actually do most of the things he'd been planning and it just wasn't all that. It kind of felt like heading out with a friend, almost, with hardly any romance. I'm not a picky person, and I hate to be shallow. I don't ask for expensive flowers or pricey restaurents. It's just the way that the date made me feel like I didn't matter as much to him anymore. I spent hours cooking for him and dolling myself up only to receive none of that same energy back. As shallow as it sounds, I wanted him to compliment me and call me pretty, but I got one 'You look nice too', only after I said it first. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but a call with a friend of mine has made me think more. Honestly, this isn't new. I've felt a lot like I've been the only one putting any sort of effort into keeping up conversation or trying to keep things interesting and romantic, but it's difficult to keep that up when I get crumbs back most of the time. I also think the age and maturity gap between us has really showed itself. He seems so different to the attentive, open-minded guy I thought I knew. Now, he just feels like your run-of-the-mill emotionally closed off boy. I can hardly reconcile the two. \n\nI wonder, is this the person I want to spend my life with? I thought he was. I still like him so much, but if it keeps going in the direction it is, I don't think I want to stay with him. I mean, how does the romance fizzle out so early? I don't want things to be so boring when it's only been two months. It's just not sustainable. It's such a shame because in every other way, he's almost perfect. Maybe this just isn't the right time for us. He's in too uncertain of a position in his life. \n\nI know the right way to go is to communicate all of this with him, but I don't know how to do that without sounding like a dick. I mean, I'm not even his girlfriend yet. I'm not really looking for advice, but I just needed to vent all this.

So we would frequently get into arguments and whatever basically i get frustrated alot because i never meet her.\n\nSo last week i told her that ill be taking a break from social media and ill be focusing on my exams since its in january and told her she can move on with her life.\n\nBUT......\na friend came to text me and told me that she has been close to another dude for quite a while and that broke me so this week i confronted her about all this shit and the reason she gave me was that\n\n \"SINCE YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT HAVING DATED B HENCE I ALSO THOUGHT IT'LL BE BETTER FOR ME TO BE CLOSE TO THIS NEW DUDE \" \n\nAnd mind you guys i came back to text her after 3 days , and 3 days was all that she took to move on to this other dude , after that i confessed the entire lie and i even told her that i lied because\n\n1. I knew its too much for her to handle(she has never been in a relationship and also has the conservative nature in her , she would ask questions whether i have kissed or touched a woman and when i would answer yes then she'd be upset)\n2.

I had no idea who he was and he initiated conversation and asked for tips with the gym etc. We quickly realized we got on very well as friends and ended up using the gym together regularly and becoming really close in the space of half a year. On many occasions he would comment about how we'd make a good couple, eventually he would start making this comment more regularly and bringing it up with me when he was drunk about how we'd be great together and explaining how he felt with me. So bare in mind he spent about 6 months chasing me, convincing me to give him a chance and explaining how good things would be with us.\n\nSkip into our relationship, were together only 4 months now and so many issues have arisen. I've had to ask him twice to remove porn pages from his social media accounts - something I never thought I'd have to do with him. On three occasions he's broken a promise to me (regarding drinking under the  influence) and made excuses each time ex. I only had one drink etc, I didn't think youd mind, it's been hours since I drank etc - even though I specifically have asked on 3 occasions not to ever put himself in that situation. He has offered to do things for me before (completely out of the blue) to the point where I am very impressed and happy that he is trying to make my life easier etc to then just not do what he said he was going to do - why say it in the first place? Anytime I bring up my feelings he gets quiet defensive and it takes him a while to come around and honestly I feel like he just tells me what he thinks I want to hear. He keeps saying he will change and I am yet to see much of a difference. We got into an argument recently as he failed to mention to me that he had kissed a very close female friend before in the past even though he is very unhappy about me having male friends in my life, whom I have had zero sexual interactions or any sort of intimacy with. I feel like there's some double standards going on as he tried to downplay the situation, but he admitted if the roles were reversed he would be very annoyed with me. I feel like he's very immature and I don't know what to do as I have developed very intense feelings for this man and Ive grown to really love him, I just can't help but feel like I'm being used for my qualities and to fill the void of loneliness. He said he loves me but I only feel it on good days, as when any sort of an issue arises he's a different man in my opinion. We have tried talking, I have raised this issues with him, he has said time and time again that he will get better, he is learning etc but I thought these were basic things - ex: don't break promises, don't follow porn accounts (he knew my views on it prior to getting into a relationship), don't say something and not do it (he only didn't do it because he decided he'd rather go to the pub instead) and just listen to the person you've upset..\n\nI don't know what more I can do, I think I just need an outsiders opinion on whether or not I'm just being a dumb woman in love. I have been single for years and really enjoy this man but I'm finding it very difficult to get over some of these things as I'm thinking into the future if it's like this already how on earth will it be in a year or mores time?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated please and thank you.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

In it was a girl I knew a bit before but never got close to and this guy who looked like someone I knew but wasn’t and kept making eye contact with me. Fast forward and I slowly joined a few events I found out the guy was good at sth that I needed help for so I asked him and he agreed to help me with it. Since it would be quite a time investment I offered to get him a snack or some food as a thank you to which he said sure he would like to go out sometime. I found him nice and thought we could get along well.\n\nFast forward a couple days before we were supposed to met, the girl I knew (also the girl in this story) threw a party to which she invited me. At that party the guy really quickly decided to lay on my lap ask me questions ask me private and intimate questions and stayed like this the whole party even when others commented on it. Even when I got up to sit somewhere else he immediately came back to me and layed his head on my chest wrapping his leg around me, asking me more questions, make me do the rice purity test, etc. He was drunk but even the next morning he immediately continued. He is generally a very touchy person however given the vibe the intensity and that going on for the whole party to me is an obvious sign someone likes you so I got curious and I was open to reciprocate. (I am btw not a dating person, I have never dated and I don’t really like touch and never care enough to persue people but when they show interest I get curious and want to see how I feel about it) \n\nFast forward him and I finally met up to eat and talk a bit, he asked about my past relationships and told me his, then we got to a park later until 1am just cuddling, being touchy and him tickling me multiple times and yeah lot’s of other stuff. We didn’t kiss bc I noticed ,and I kept that a secret, that thats sth I am uncomfortable with but he got close to my face multiple times like as if we were about to. I did at one point while cuddling give him a forehead kiss that I asked him if he wanted one. Eventually towards the end I confronted him about his intentions to which he acted all terrified and said it’s just friendly and that he’s like this with all his friends (much later I asked these friends and they said no not like that). I was pissed got up and expressed how taken advantage of I felt. Days passed and bc I knew I will see him again a lot I asked for a conversation in which he apologised said he led me on and talked about going to therapy now bc of me and genuinely wanting to regain my trust. I was vary of it but I knew I’d have my distance and could see if he really meant it and also he wasn’t finished helping me. \n\nFast forward a like 3 or 4 months pass and he comes by to help me with the project to which he was at my house and we got along again surprisingly just talking having fun which I took with a grain of salt and I wanted to address it. Before I got the chance to do that, that girl friend of mine opened up about being cheated on by a guy shes been together with for sometime now and it turned out to be that exact guy and that she knew everything that had happened between me and him as well back then ( they were already intimate with each other at that time). ( I had a suspicion already for a longer time but I was unsure esp. because he kept telling me he loves nth more than being solo and how nice it is) \n\nShe told me about how shes still trying to make their relationship work but all I could feel at that moment was discomfort about how I hang out with both of them and they were secretly together and both conscious about what happened without me knowing that. She’s been trying to get closer to me as a friend for a while now and planning many future activities with me and I really wanted it but idk how to feel anymore. \n\nNow just recently the guy told her (which she said she wanted to tell me because it would help me ‘process my emotions’) and another friend of ours that I was just an ego boost to him. That other friend also told me the way the guy told him the story he made himself passive in the storytelling, that I just tried to kiss him and he was just being friendly, and emphasised on that I was hurt by being led on and by the rejection. (To which I would like to say that I told the guy explicitly idc about relationships or rejections like that and for me what hurt me was being taken advantage of like that and put into a vulnerable position for his gratification). (Also i never really felt rejected tbh bc I didnt consider someone flriting and advancing with me and me being open  and curious about it as a rejection really but thats another topic)\n\nRight now I feel completely disgusted, disrespected and so dehumanised. I’ve been completely objectified and reduced to just an ego boost and that with the consciousness of the girl I wanted to consider my friend. She is trying to make her relationship work with the guy and apparently he puts lots of effort into it and reflects a lot to a degree my other friend is conflicted because he thinks that guy is being genuine and trying. While on the otherside the guy seems to not try to make up for me at all or care and really just admits to having used me like a tool. I dont even feel like I was seen as a friend maybe not even a person.\n\nI don’t know how it seems to be accepted by the others that that guy just objectifies me like that and just used me to boost his ego. Idk how to feel about that this was a known fact among him and the girl and I have to now rethink all my memories through that lense and the fact that he probably just saw everything I do through the lense he fabricated of ‘oh she likes me and i rejected her’. Idk if I can continue being in a friend circle where my dehumanisation to just someone pretty that can be used for ego gratification seems like an accepted thing. \n\n\nAnyone has tips how to deal with this situation or understands it? \nThanks everyone in advance!", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I am at my wits end, what can I even do if I’ve communicated everything?\n\nA lot of the time we argue it’s because of tone or “jokes” that I clearly state affect me especially when I’m feeling sensitive. I try my best to manage my cptsd and hormonal issues but if I’m going to be around someone a lot I want them to truly take those things into consideration. I’m never asking him to “heal” me or anything.\n\nThe “jokes” I mention are super anxiety inducing for me. For example earlier, we were going to spend time together and I said okay in a bit I just want to play this game after you. He tossed his phone out of his hand kinda and sighed and stuff like that automatically puts me in fight or flight, I can’t help that. I try to manage my triggers on my own but at some point it’s like okay I’ve communicated this many times, and neither of us even find it funny. He seems to only think it’s funny when I take it seriously. \n\n\nIt leads always to a huge argument where we’re just snowballing and hashing things out and it’s miserable. It never stops. And I’ll admit, when he tells me his feelings I try to justify my actions rather than just hear him so I know I could do better with that. At some point in the argument he’ll just say he’s frustrated with me etc. I try to keep calm and that usually makes me come across as cold but I’m trying so hard not to cry because I’m so TIRED of fighting. Then he gets confused why I cry and isn’t able to hug me or comfort me. He usually ends up saying he’s done talking and I just feel even more alone than we started. \n\n\n\nAll throughout the arguments I try explaining my feelings and that I thought I communicated my feelings well initially and he will just say things like “well I know I didn’t do anything” to that I said, “that attitude is one of the major things that cause our arguments” he says “so you’re trying to blame it all on me now?”\n\n\n\nTLDR: I get upset over boyfriend’s “jokes” that consist of him pretending to be mad, really triggering for me. When I express that, and it doesn’t change over time, I get frustrated and he does too. Throughout the conversation he will literally say things like “this is your fault” etc, as I’m begging to act like a team.

Then she went to LA for 6 weeks and we argued often, cause we didn't spend a lot of time together over calls and that was the only way of communication. When she came we had a whole argument about snapchat, cause after the first fight she tought that I may be hiding something, cause I also am very private with using my phone(don't like people looking at it, mostly because everyone at works tends to be nosy and have to make comments every chance I get). After a lot of arguing and me not wanting to show SnapChat, because I was on my privacy protection high horse, we cleared it up. I had nothing to hide, I was just uncomfortable with the whole thing out of my habit. Then she caught me smoking and in panic I lied about it, cause I was ashamed. After all of that I went on 4 week vacation, 1,5 weeks in and we have been fighthing a lot. Also had 3 day no contact period.

We’ve stayed in touch for 9 years, and I’m wondering if I should move on, or see if she still feels the same?\n\nI’ve never posted on Reddit before, so bear with me. I think this will be a long post, so I’ll give a summary and then get into the details \n\nHere’s the long story short. It sounds completely crazy, but I swear it was love at first sight. I’ve had really strong instant connections with other people in the past, but nothing has ever compared to this. It was like I’d always known her, like I knew her the way I know myself. We had a very short and intensely deep relationship (about 3 months), but unfortunately both of us had dealt with a lot of hard things in life, and had a lot of growing to do as people. When we broke up, she told me that she thought I was perfect, but didn’t feel she was in a place in life where she was ready for a relationship this intense, and that she didn’t want to mess it up. She said that one day when she was ready, she would let me know, and it would be up to me at that point to decide if it was still what I wanted. I completely felt the same, and we went our separate ways. We’ve stayed in touch off and on throughout the years, and have been talking a bit more recently. In the last couple months, we both ended up having relationships end with long term partners (mine 4Y, hers 6y on and off). We are planning on seeing each other when visiting home for the holidays, and I’m wondering if I should bring it up, or is it time to move on? \n\nHere’s where I’ll give more details. The last time we really hung out in person was right before I met my most recent ex, and she was not currently seeing her previous partner (they were on and off throughout the years). At this time I was visiting home, and we ended up hanging out for 3 days straight. We met at a bar and were admittedly drinking a fair amount, and I asked her if she still meant what she said all those years ago. She told me that she did mean it, and apologized if she had come across inconsistently in her feelings. We went back to my hotel and stayed up all night talking about getting married, and even picked several potential wedding dates. She was in school at the time, and I lived in a different city, so we agreed that it still wasn’t the right time for us, but that once she finished school we would try to work things out. I left feeling ecstatic, I thought we were really going to give things a shot. \n\nSo Reddit, this is where all of our hearts break. When I got back from my trip, she sent me a message saying that she was sorry, but that she had been talking with (previous partner) and felt like she really needed to give it another chance. I was crushed to say the least, and we didn’t talk for several years after this. I felt like I’d kind of made a fool of myself, and told myself I needed to move on. \n\nSo here’s the thing. I am a heavily science-minded person. I have spent years psychoanalyzing the way that I feel about this, talking myself in and out of it, rationalizing, but there’s some things that just can’t be explained. The first one is the strangest. When we initially broke up, I could not stop thinking about her, and I eventually decided to un-add her on all social media so I wouldn’t have a reminder/notifications when she posted. I got to the point where I would go months at a time without thinking about her at all, but every time, without fail, I would then have a dream about her. It was always some variation of the same thing, us hanging out, and her eventually telling me not to give up on her. And every time, she would text me the next day. FOR YEARS. The other thing is, even though I could go some time without thinking about her, my feelings have never gone away even a little bit. I’ve for sure been in love with other people in the past, heartbroken even (which is confusing), but the feelings always fade after some time passes. For whatever reason though, 9 years later, I still feel that same way I did on day one. \n\nAnd here are my last few points (if you’ve made it this far, thank you). I mentioned that recently we’ve been in touch again, and when we talk it’s like no time has passed at all. We literally had an 11 hour phone call, and I never wanted it to end. It always feels so natural, and I laugh, and I feel understood, and I’m excited to hear everything she has to say. We’ve also sent some gifts back and forth in the mail (we both just had birthdays), and the things I received made me feel more seen than I have in a long time. The most compelling thing though is as we’ve been talking I can tell we have both grown a lot now. We’ve both been to therapy, moved away from home, started working towards big career goals, and reflected on ourselves. We want the same things out of life (talked about kids, money, housing, relationships, etc.) and I just can’t help but feel like she is truly my soulmate. \n\nHowever, it’s true that she has been inconsistent throughout the years (a lot of times understandably, but still), and I know that she knows how I feel, so I can’t help but think that if she still wanted this she would say something. We also live decently far away from each other now, and I am currently in college (went back to school a few years ago). AND we also just got out of long term relationships, and it feels a little messy. I know the truth is that I would have to get to know her all over again, and all of this is pretty much a gamble on a short relationship I had when I was 17. \n\nSo Reddit, is it worth bringing it up again when I go home for Christmas, or is it time to move on?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Trigger warning: DA\n\nSo a little back story. I was in a relationship with this guy for more than a year. \n\nI recently went on a trip back home to see my family. \n\nBefore I went on this trip, a few days prior. One day he got in my face and started yelling at me uncontrollably, he was so loud and I was so scared. I begged him stop, eventually I placed my hand on his face gently and begged him to calm down. I have long nails and he moved fast. He then tossed his shirt across the room. Pushed me forcefully onto the bed and got on top of me and started making his hands to a fist trying to punch me. I started praying for my life, praying I wouldn't die that night. He then starts having a seizure and falls off the bed. At this point, I was shaking uncontrollably and crying but I didn't want him to die.  I then tried to turn him so he wouldn't choke on his spit. His seizure eventually stopped but when he managed to get up, he didn't remember anything. He said he only remembered yelling. He cried when I told what he did. That night I didn't feel comfortable sleeping in the same bed as him, so he slept outside. \n\nThe next day, I told him that he needed to get help. I told him to be honest with his parents and maybe they can support you in getting help. I told him I couldn't see myself feeling safe in the relationship unless he gets help. He told me he promises he will get help. He then called his mom infront of me and she was so upset. She told him never to lay hands on another man's daughter. The next few days after that last incident happened, I was shaking a lot. I had random palpitations throughout the day, i got startled by loud sounds and I had dreams of him killing me.\n\nThen I went on my trip to see my family and he knows my family is abusive. While on my trip. One day he went out with a couple friends. His phone broke and he disappeared for two days, he then texts me from his friends phone and says he wants to talk about something. I told him I was busy, but he said he couldn't wait and then he sends me a breakup text. He says he doesn't think we can be in a relationship anymore, he needs to work on his self, he doesn't want to keep hurting people around him and that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with anyone at the moment. He has to many problems in his head that he needs to work on. \n\nA few days later, I returned from my travel to find out he got into another relationship. And I had to see them out together, he didn't get help and just jumped into the next relationship. \n\nHis friend then tells me \"Maybe u pushed him to abuse you\", \"they are so in love, it was love at first sight\", \"he is serious about this girl\", \"he has every right to be in a new relationship, its not cheating anyway\". I was shocked. And apparently his family is forcing him to return back home to be closer to them so he can get help. And he did mention that in the breakup text that his family is forcing him back home. His friend said \"maybe that's why he broke up with you, its because of you that he is going back home\"\n\nI'm just so hurt and confused. How can you be in a relationship with someone for more than 1 year and after physically abusing them, you breakup with them abruptly (not even face to face) and suddenly you are in love? Like I feel so discarded and so unlovable. Like I never even mattered. He just did the unthinkable and just gets to move on like that and his friends are blaming me? And I can't even go out without seeing them happy together.

A bit about me, I grew up in a very unstable household to then experience some very traumatic things. I have done therapy and lots of work on myself. I unfortunately have a chronic illness, Chronic fatigue plays a big part in this(note this for later) I am an overthinking, protective and sensitive person while I am also very empathetic, bubbly and truly love life. My boyfriend grew up with a larger family and very strict parents. He is funny, loves to make jokes, kind and a good person. Most days we get along great. Life seems simple and easy with him. He’s a provider which helps me a lot and it’s something he likes doing. Due to my chronic fatigue I do find it harder to work longer hours and end up sick. So being with someone who loves to provide takes a huge stress off me. fyi I do not need him to be financially stable but he helps which is obviously a huge benefit and I always remind him he doesn’t have too and that I want him to get what he wants which he does do! \nAnyways let’s get to my main point. \nWhenever there’s a small comment made that bothers me or something he does that I do and don’t like ends up being an argument. I then feel shut down and that my feelings are invalid which I also tell him!! We just have things here and there that we just don’t agree on and end up meaning a lot to each of us. We are different we both are aware of that. He’s not protective at all, he isn’t a gentleman. Which are 2 things that are important to me in my relationship. He struggles with reassurance (I know most guys do but he really sucks) and out sex drives are completely different. His is a lot higher and mines lower. I enjoy it with him I just don’t want it to be a daily thing. He always listens when I say no so that’s not a problem but I do feel in the long run for him it will be. He also hates how I’m protective(not controlling I promise you) and I think it’s from his strict childhood of not being able to do stuff that he’s worried about. Which I completely get but in my case I really do just care and want him to be safe. Where as in return he says to me “do what you want, you don’t have to tell me” which hurts and I feel dismissed. \nThere is so much more too it but I won’t write forever but I do want to add he left his ex and then went straight into a relationship with me. (I didn’t know) has lied about a few things he said to “protect me” he lives at my house and he doesn’t have a car. His parents and him are rocky, And he doesn’t have anywhere to go if I do break up with him which I will feel bad about because as i mentioned above he’s a good person just not my person I don’t think. He’s trying to hard to be the right one for me but unfortunately I don’t think it’s going to work for either of us. I’m not sure if we just stay together until we both go our own ways or call it now. We both have talked about it like i mentioned so it wouldn’t come out of the blue for him. I’m sorry this was so long!!

How do I handle the situation?\n\nI should start by saying that I’m sorry if this is all over the place, I’m just bad with words.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I(30F) met this guy, we’ll just call him Boy 1(29M), in a video game, and we became good friends. I was in a relationship at that time, and never thought of him as anything more than a friend. Fast forward 2 years, and we stop talking.\n\nSkip to 3 years later and one of our friends gets us in to a group together. Once we realize who the other is, we talk and become friends again realizing it was just a messed up situation. At this point I am not in a relationship anymore, so a few months down the line we start flirting and snap chatting, and eventually become kind of a long distance FWB. We both agreed we didn’t want a real relationship because of the distance. This went on for about 5 years.\n\nI started to catch feelings, but still didn’t want a relationship, neither did he, but he also knew how I felt, and it seemed he felt the same way.\n\nThe problems started a little over a year in to our “relationship” where he would just randomly ghost, radio silence, and only to me. But he would show back up a week later like nothing happened. I would explain that it felt a little crappy that he would only stop talking to me. He would say he needed a break because he was overstimulated and that he was sorry he stopped talking to me, so we would just end up resuming any kind of flirting. He did this almost always around Christmas every year. Then in January I was talking to him about moving south and asking if he wanted to meet up, and see how things would go.. He told me we needed to “just stop” with the flirting and everything and just be normal friends. I told him I would try, but wasn’t sure what a normal friend to him would be, since our “relationship” was the way it was for YEARS.\n\nHe decided to ghost me again… Only this time, he didn’t decide to come back until mid July.. The first 3 months were full of me crying because I lost the one person who was there almost EVERY day and every night. After 3 months I started to accept he wasn’t coming back, or even going to bother trying to reconnect, so my feelings for him started to fade away.\n\nBut when he came back he tried resume any kind of “relationship” we had before… I told him it felt wrong and weird since I was so hurt by him leaving for so long without any word..\n\nSo I found a new guy, Boy 2(36M), who was giving me everything I wanted, which is just someone to enjoy the company of. We played games together, he calls me at night and we just talk, he makes me laugh uncontrollably hard, makes me smile so much my cheeks hurt, and calls me cute little names. But we also don’t want a real relationship because of the distance, but we have plans to meet in March of next year.\n\nBoy 1 found out about this and started making things weird, so weird boy 2 won’t join us in games anymore out of respect of not making boy 1 uncomfortable.\n\nBoy 1 decided to tell me that for the entire 5 years of our “relationship” he did in fact love me, and wants me to stop talking to boy 2, because he’s trying to become a better man so he can be with me properly… He is unemployed, technically. He’s a farmhand on his uncles farm. So he wants to move out and get financially stable before he allows himself to be with me. I never once told him he needed to change anything about himself, I always told him I liked him as he was and if he truly wanted to change things, I would be willing to help if given the chance. He asked me to wait for him, but hasn’t taken any steps to prove he’s really trying to change for me.. I told him I don’t want to wait, because the future isn’t guaranteed, and if he really wanted a relationship he would just take it now, and accept that I’m willing to either go there, or him come here. But he refuses until he’s “better”.\n\nI told him I won’t stop talking to boy 2 because we are not in a committed relationship, and boy 2 and I are friends who expect nothing from one another.\n\nNow boy 1 constantly makes me feel like I just ran over a puppy anytime I even mention boy 2.(I should note, I never tell him anything about boy 2, just casually mention that boy 2 said something funny, or that he could help in the video game we were playing.) He shuts down and starts making me feel bad for still talking to him while also talking to boy 1.. He tells me he feels like his time isn’t being valued when he declines hanging out with other people because I’m around, and always thinks of me when doing things.. I never guilt trip him to doing anything. I always tell him to go do other things, because I know it’s important to spend time with people.\n\nI told boy 1 that if he wasn’t so anxious about leaving the farm, I would 100% buy his plane ticket and have him come stay with me for a week, since I have my own home and can host a visitor. But he refuses profusely because I “shouldn’t be the one buying the plane ticket”\n\nI just need outside opinions on how to handle this..

This was my first real adult relationship. I realized that even though I had compromised on so much of what is important to me, my needs were still not being met. I had brought up so many times the things that are important to me, and was dismissed or given an empty promise or excuse each time. \n\nI really don't think what I was asking for was unreasonable. I wanted him to get an STI test, make a continuing effort to learn about my religion/culture/language, take some sort of certification class (he currently works as a cashier), and a few other things. Things that would improve his life as well as our relationship. There was always some sort of excuse. He signed up for a class after the ultimatum and did the other things after the relationship ended. He has also made comments about his time running out to start a family, that he feels like he achieved his goal of getting a girl, and other similar comments that make me feel like he is settling for me. I was left feeling like I was not worthy of him actually wanting to do these things. \n\nThese past few months, I realized something has been feeling off/missing.

But I did not like the fact that an ultimatum was what it took, and realized he does not really check as many of my boxes as I thought he did. So I made the difficult decision the end the relationship. \n\nHe reached out the other day, and we spoke for a bit. He is now actively making steps to do what I have been asking for all along, and apologized for everything. He's asking what it would take for me to try again. I, of course, still love him and care about him and don't want to miss out on something good. The good times were really good. So I am conflicted. How do I know things will be different? How do I know that he's doing these things for himself and not just to get me back? \n\n  \nTLDR: I broke up because my needs weren't being met, but now he is doing what I asked.

I’ve had this heavy pit in my stomach ever since. I think part of it is that I’ve gotten comfortable, he’s all I’ve ever known, but now I’m questioning if I even want him and it’s making me feel so gross and guilty.\n\nWe do have good times, but we also argue a lot over little things (chores, money, how much time we spend together vs apart). And honestly, sometimes I feel more relief when he’s not home. That has me questioning whether I said yes because I really wanted to… or because it was the easier option than saying no after eight years.\n\nNow he’s talking about telling our families and planning a date, and I feel sick with anxiety. I don’t want to hurt him, but I also don’t want to commit to something that doesn’t feel right deep down.\n\nHas anyone else been in this position like saying yes out of comfort/familiarity and then doubting it after? Did those feelings pass?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I moved out into my own apartment early (at 16), because I lived in an abusive household. I met him when I moved away from my hometown and became independent in the town that he lived. He was of course, living a “regular” childhood at home, while I was struggling, and sometimes just literally starving. It was hard. Because of this, there were a lot of years when we weren’t on the same page maturity wise.  I had been paying for bills and buying groceries in my childhood home since I was 13. I was able to do so by working several jobs under the table. He had been living what I would consider a mostly regular life. He grew up pretty disadvantaged as well, but he always had food, a home and a safe bed to go home to. \n\nFast forward three years, we have moved in together and are roommates with several other people in a college town. I’m going to school and working full time, while he is working full time. The roommates throw a party, one thing leads to another and there is a fight. Looking back, I can’t even remember what started it, but it was about me. I think another man looked at me in a way that made my now husband upset and he lost it? I truly don’t know, but what happened next scared me. Everyone in the party did everything they could to split them up. That ended up with me, his sister, him and a few other people in one room. The other fighting party in another, with some other people I’m guessing? I tried to block the door of the room we were in so that my now husband, wouldn’t leave to fight this other guy. I was a total mess, crying with my arms spread wide facing him in front of the door. I was so confident that no matter how mad he was, he wouldn’t hurt me. I was wrong.\n\nI remember him grabbing me by the throat, then I remember gasping for air on the floor with people screaming-including his sister. Apparently I’d been choked and thrown to the floor by my throat and neck. According to those that were there, I landed flat on my back and hand the wind knocked out of me.\nIt took a long time, but I forgave him. I would have told anyone that I loved to run, I would have begged them to do so. I know how stupid I was the time to not leave, but I didn’t  and no one asked me to do so. \n\nFast forward again, seven years later. My mom passed away and I had become the only person able or responsible enough to handle the final details. I was 27 years old, had barely any money scrapped away to take care of her final arrangements, and most significantly, I was in no mental capacity to do so. My now husband, was there supportive, and helped me throughout every step. We made it through, but barely. \n\nThroughout those years, I had lost so many people, but this was the hardest. I was sad, filled with anxiety and depressed. After she died, we were still intimate, but not nearly as regularly as we had been. \n\nSoon after her 1 year death anniversary, I was a wreck. My husband, took me out for dinner to try to cheer me up. I went begrudgingly. We ordered very strong drinks and by the time we got home I knew I was drunk. I had a sick feeling in my stomach (more ways than one), and was worried that with the way he had been acting, he would want more than to just go to sleep.I told him that I was drunk, I was really sad, and I was worried I would get sick from how much I drank. I begged him to please just let me sleep that night. I begged him not to touch me. Then I foolishly and drunkenly went to bed after creating a stupid pillow fort around me on my side of the bed as a deterrent.\n\nI woke up around 3am, still drunk and confused. I won’t get into details but he was in the act of SA-ing me. It was horrible. Horrible isn’t even enough to describe it, but the fall out was worse. I’ve been in and out of depression since and I haven’t been able to sleep when I’m in the same room as him. I have night terrors regularly and every time we fight, I lock myself in the guest bedroom out of fear-even for small fights.\n\nI’ve told you all the worst of it. Two really terrible moments in 13 years. We’ve had 13 years where he was my person and truly the only one in my corner. I love him dearly and I don’t know how I could go on being alone. I just don’t know how to get past this incident. If you are together long enough, something horrible is bound to happen. I know horrible things happen in other relationships too and I’m not near the only one.

But lately I’ve been scared she's a conservative, and honestly it’s eating me alive. I’ve always been clear that I don’t want to be close with people who hold those kinds of views, because our morals and values are VERY different. The idea that she, of all people, might secretly hold them would literally break me.\n\nIt started after she went through a big life event and suddenly became very Christian. Since then, I’ve noticed little things:\n\nI told her about how some guy at a party asked me to go upstairs like 2 minutes after meeting me, and I was telling her how disgusted I was. She responded with “well, you shouldn’t have put yourself in a situation like that if you didn’t want something to happen.” That gave me big “if you didn’t want to get assaulted, why did you wear that?” vibes.\n\nAnother time, when I was scared I might have been pregnant, she said “well, if people don’t want to get pregnant they shouldn’t have sex.” It came off very judgmental and prudish.\n\nWhenever I make comments like “oh I don’t wanna be around xyz cause they’re MAGA/conservative/Republican,” she goes silent. No reaction.\n\nWe were talking about dating (we both see the same tarot reader, and she told her she’d end up with someone with different views). I mentioned, “what if he’s conservative/MAGA/Republican?” and she goes “you know I’m an independent, right?” (which… that’s what they all say when they’re hiding it). Barely reacted. But when I pushed it and said “what if he’s a neo-Nazi?” she immediately said “omg well my dad’s Jewish.” That difference in reaction felt like a huge red flag.\n\nPlsu, after Charlie Kirk passed, I mentioned how I got shamed for not feeling bad (like, I don’t think he deserved to die, but I’m not gonna mourn someone who spread so much hate). And once again… crickets from her.\n\n\nAll these little things keep piling up. And now I can’t stop worrying that she’s actually conservative/MAGA/ replublican and just doesn’t want to admit it.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a friend suddenly shifting like this? Do I bring it up, or just wait and see? I’m torn because this is my literal best friend since forever, but the anxiety of her secretly being one of them is eating me alive.\n\n\nTLDR: My lifelong best friend recently became very religious (yk a lot of the time, that's where it starts) , and I’m noticing subtle comments and silence that make me fear she’s conservative/Republican. I don’t want to be close to people with those values, but she’s my ride-or-die.

She grew up in a broken household with absent parents while I grew up in the traditional nuclear family with parents who are in a healthy relationship. She is a 1st generation Asian American from a family that immigrated, while I am a white German American family.\n\nWe have been dating for just over four months now and we have come to learn we have very different political views, we did discuss this very early on in the relationship but did not do a deep dive. \n\nMy partner is very far left individual due to racism, sexism, and gender dysphoria faced throughout their life. She pretty much agrees with all far left ideologies, she states she hates all men, and considers all Trump supporters to be racist, sexist, and she believes in abortion rights (just to name a few topics). She did grow up in Christianity but had a rough experience that involved racism so she does not practice any form of religion.\n\nI have been raised catholic and conservative, so a lot of my political beliefs stem from the Bible and Christianity (union is between a man and woman, generally against abortions, don't agree with LGBT lifestyle). I am not a trump supporter, but I am indeed conservative with my views. I believe all people deserved to be loved regardless of how they look, I just have trouble agreeing with ideologies/lifestyle choices.\n\nOne night we had a pretty bad argument about all those political topics mentioned and we never found a common ground. She stated that she does not want to be with someone who is against her rights or who is not an ally of LGBT. I've told her that I treat all humans with love and respect, but it does not mean I HAVE to agree with their lifestyle choices. She was not the biggest fan of that and she asked me to do research on those respective groups to try to understand some of the issues they face. To which I have, but however it has only hardened my beliefs. She is aware that I am catholic and that I study the Bible, I have tried to have to read the Bible to see my point of view but she is very against it at times. To me, it feels like a \"my way or the highway\" situation, but I may be over thinking it. \n\nI very much enjoy her company and can see myself having a future with her.

{"id": "u/soundisamazing_772", "user": "u/soundisamazing", "text": "My 31m father 68m has never shown care towards me, not sure if I should cut him off or not\n\nHi, my father has some very deep rooted issues and it has impacted me tremendously through my life. It caused me to hate him for a long time, and when I tried to approach it at an older age (30) to fix our relationship, it flooded back to me and caused me a lot of pain, becuase he is incapable of changing.\n\nTo start, my dad was always \"there\" physically, but never emotionally. My mom did absolutely everything despite them both working full time. She cooked, cleaned, took 3 kids to and from school, to and from sports, signed us up, payed attention to our needs and met them. I was diagnosed diabetic at 9, a disease that needs basically 24/7 care by parents at that age before you can do it yourself, my mom learned everything my dad did nothing. If I was dying on the ground, he wouldnt know what to do and would call my mom for help. Never talked to me about how its going being a child with diabetes. He didnt help me move into adult hood, no advice, no career help or post secondary guidance, I was very talented at many things but he never once asked me about it. He basically checked out completely.\n\nI went through some mental health issues last year and sat my parents down and told them im having scary thoughts and am pretty worried about my well being. I finished that sentence, he said \"im going to bed\". My mom does not stand up for me when things like this happen. She went through the same thing with him I assume.\n\nWhen I bring these things up to him, he has a different story in his head. Its never his fault even when there is factual evidence. He explained him leaving the mental health conversation as \"I thought you and mom would have a more meaningful convo about it so I wanted to let you be in private\". Never his fault.\n\nThis year ive tried breaching the topic and talking to him about all of this. He rejected it. Made it into my problem. For about 6 months we had discussions and 6 months of him telling me im crazy and making things up. My sister comes in and says im not making this up because she feels the same. Only then did he apologized for not being there for us growing up and how things will change from now on. So for years I have been talking about this stuff, seriously for 6 months and he knew exactly what I was saying, yet still decided to make me feel like a problem, and make me feel crazy, putting the blame on me when he knew it wasnt the case. Absolutely terrible thing to do to someone if you ask me.\n\nSo he wanted to have weekly talks with me to mend the relationship finally, after me trying to do this for years. I allowed him to schedule these because its not my responsibility to hold his hand through a problem he created, and made me feel like it was my fault for it my whole life. We did 2 talks, then he stopped bothering with them. He made a million excuses why he cant. These excuses did not make sense logically. Just total delusion. When I get upset about him letting me down, Its now my issue again. He said \"in my mind things have changed a lot\" and \"I didnt put as much importance on these talks as you because I knew they would eventually keep happening\". Absolute avoidance of every issue at hand. He has convinced himself one apology is enough to fix a life time of things, he feels better about it, case closed for him. No thought about how anyone else feels around him.\n\nWe had one last talk the other day and I blew up at him completely. He is a very bad person for making me feel like a problem my whole life, everything is my fault, then apologizing and admitting his faults once, then turning around on that and making me feel its my fault again. Every time we talked and I explained how I felt, his response was \"thats not true\" and \"thats not under my control\". I say things as clear as 2+2=4 and he says \"thats not true\" even after Ive proven it to be true and everyone around agrees. I told him I need to give up because this is eating me alive, and his response was \"lets call it a truce\". Now our whole family dynamic is harmed because we cannot be in the same room as eachother. Again making me feel like this is my doing because if I didnt breach the topic, things would be as they were. Silent resentment but liveable.\n\nI dont know where to go other than cutting him off completely. That means he gets to be at family events being fine with everyone and I need to avoid them. I have so much hatred that I need to let go of for my own well being. Any advice here?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I'll call the F32 Carla, a fictional name.\n\nThis will be a long post, i'm sorry for that.\n\nI switched job at the beginning of this year and started in a new place, where I met Carla that worked in a different department, but with plenty of chance to chat/meet.\n\nI was in a relationship at that time and wasn't looking for anything of the sort, so we just chatted sporadically at the coffe machine.\n\nDuring the months we grew closer and started talking a bit more frequently, even after work.\n\nWe grew closer and closer as friends.\n\nShe was also in a relationship at that time and we started helping each other by discussing our relationship's problems, she was in a toxic relationship where her boyfriend would frequently snap at her, disrespect her and making her feel guilty for the most various stuff.\n\nI wasn't feeling happy in my relationship since my girlfriend would prioritize her own goals and plans over me at any time.\n\nBy helping each other out we gradually grew even closer and realized that actually we started developing feeling for each other. This was late July.\n\nWe spoke about it (And did nothing else, there wasn't anything physical between us, but I admin that there was some emotional infidelity on both our ends at this point, which I'm not proud of) and decided that we'll both try to understand what to do with our lives in the next few weeks.\n\nThis until she decides to leave her boyfriend 1/2 days later and went back to her parents house.\n\nWe meet again to talk and she says that she'll not wait for me for a long time and gives me a deadline. I specified that if she wanted just to bother me with a fling or anything like that, I would have said goodbye to her to never talk to her again, I was there for a life-plan, not for some fun. She said she was of the same idea.\n\nAfter a week or so of thinking I decide to close my relationship, since the problems that Carla helped me realize were real.\n\nAfter this we start \"dating\" mostly in secret since she didn't want to tell her parents, fearing that they'll judge her.\n\nFast forward 3/4 weeks after we started this \"secret\" relationship she tells me that in this moment she can't think of starting anything else, that she first needs to be happy even alone.\n\nDuring all this time she started seeing a therapist and had quite a lot of problems with her ex boyfriend that did all he could to guilt-trip her and making her feel like she abandoned him.\n\nWhen she tells me that i obviously feel quite saddened, but since i'm a rational person I can't argue that it would be the best thing. A switch between two relationships isn't the the best outcome. So we agreed to stay as friends with no expectations.\n\nAt the start we continued to text each other every day, until she told me that she was feeling we were still too close, so we grew distant.\n\nAfter some other weeks (mind we work \"together\"), in which we texted more sporadically and I kept a polite collegue-friend attitude, she told me that she wanted to get closer again, since she was missing our friendship, to which I agreed, since I liked having her as a friend.\n\nN.B. At this time my expectation for a relationship with her were mostly non-existent.\n\nWe started texting again for a couple days when she came out with a \"I'm sorry, but whenever we talk as friends i feel guilty to my ex-bf because of when we talked before i left him, I feel horrible having done something like this to him.

I'm also sorry for ruining our friendship. I wish you all the best, truly.\"\n\n\"The fact is that I don't regret anything that happened. I had entered a dark tunnel and saw everything negatively. I was judging myself first and foremost.\n\nI hope you will be able to harbor less resentment towards me over time. The friendship that initially bound us together was special to me. Have a good Saturday.\"\n\nI told her that i wasn't harboring any resentment, just a little bit of disappointment to which she started defending herself saying that she was sorry that she didn't meet my expectations of her.\n\nI concluded by telling her all the thing that happened (in the same way i wrote here) and that I was always coherent with what I said. She told me that she was trying to do her best to not hurt anyone and sort her chaos out. I told her that this time I couldn't really help her and she said that she wouldn't have asked me since it wasn't my duty to help her in that case.\n\nAfter 10 days or so, where we were distant, but still polite/friendly and she went on her pto, it was her birthday and i texted her happy birthday and that I truly wished she was happy since she told me that she usually hated her birthday (Something about getting old, she was quite stressed about getting old, having white hair or anything like that).\n\nShe answered that she was truly grateful and that she truly missed our friendship.\n\nAnother 5/6 days after this i text her to ask her if she had some time to catch up since i got her a little present for her birthday (nothing too crazy, truly). She was grateful and told me that she would like to postpone to the next week since that week she had to deal with some stuff. I told her that if she wasn't confortable in meeting me that would have been totally fine and with no hard feelings at all.\n\nThen i had my PTO and she didn't text me, which I was prepared to, so actually not a big deal.\n\nLast fast-forward to last thursday, when i came back from my PTO. I was friendly/polite as usual and I didn't mention the birthday at all, since I understood that would have made her unconfortable. That evening she sent me a vocal message saying that she was told from some people from her office that there could be something between us since we were seeing talking from time to time or when I waited her before leaving the building or for lunch (Which I did as per our mutual agreement in the months before, since we left together and we went to lunch together) and she didn't want any rumor to spread and for us to become more \"casual\" colleagues in particular now that there wasn't any reason to do so, closing the message by saying that she hoped that after all this \"hard\" time that we would be able to chat again freely like before.\n\nMind me, I was already trying to be more casual with her before that message, so i just replied that I was sorry that she was feeling like that, it was totally unintentional on my side and:\n\n\"Don't worry, there will be no way to feed further rumors!\"\n\nSince then I started actively avoiding her and speaking with her and she seem to have done the same.\n\nTL;DR: Girl is doing an emotion rollercoaster and I can't figure out shit\n\nNow, guys.\n\nI'm open to every question to let you understand better the situation.\n\nFor now I'm pretty sure that she want's drama in her life since she always had drama with her boyfriends, but I'm totally not up for that so I'm 100% sure that I don't want anything romantical develpment with her.  \nCan you help me understand her mind a little bit? For now I'm still going no-contact at all, especially in the office where I understood the true meaning of an old saying over here that should translate like \"Never stick your d\\*ck in your job or in your building\", since it's a pain in the ass.\n\nThank you if you reached this point", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

After our first year in Europe he went back home to get his drivers license ( I stayed in Europe) so he also went back to our high school where he saw some friends. There was a party at the school with people from our school and other schools from different cities. He went to the party.

Some of which we even dance with in our couple’s dance lessons.\n\nOne invited him to a bar when we were dating. He asked me if it was ok (without mentioning their past). I wanted to be the ‘cool girlfriend’ and said yes.  I’d always felt iffy about her and noticed he was nervous, but I wanted give him the benefit of the doubt and be the ‘cool girlfriend’. \n\nLater she made rude comments about our relationship, and I found out he had tried to date her (and others). He did not tell these women that we were in a relationship (until the women asked directly, way into our relationship) and he would simply reply “yes”.\n\nHis explanation was that the communication was friendly and that he is private about things he cares about (me). I told him he also has to consider what he signals to others and to me. He said I should only care about how he feels for me.\n\nSome were audio calls, some audio messages, some texts. Some were only one date, some months of dating, some years of marriage.\nI have only seen a handful of texts. And I keep thinking there’s more that I don’t know about. \n\nHe admits that he should’ve been more transparent and that he was selfish because he had had a principle about not wanting a partner to control his friendships in any way. He says he now understands that he needs to take the other person into consideration.\n\nStill, I found out about another woman he’d sent audio messages with for months. He had stopped replying some months before our talk, but he only admitted after I’d asked 10 times that he’d asked her to be in a relationship with him (after knowing her one day). I have not heard the messages. I wish I had. I wish I could look through all his messages with these women to see what they’ve been talking about while he was with me. \n\nAt a recent wedding, he got seemingly excited about another woman being there and stood up to call her, but then changed his mind, sat down, and told me it was nothing anyway. Later, I saw old messages between them. He had sent a video of them dancing the first day the met and later, he told her that their “conversation was still in his heart”. He says it the topic was about a job change, but the wording sounded so intimate to me. This was before our relationship, to be fair. \nTwo days after the wedding, she texted him to catch up and he showed me the message (on his own). He told me there had never been anything between them, though. \nWhen I asked him to mention that he has a girlfriend, she replied, “I am happy for both of you”. I may be influenced by the insecurity now, but I would only say “I am happy for the both of you” to someone I had had feelings for to signal that I was not a threat. But maybe that’s just me. \n\nI don’t feel he protects our relationship or gives me the maturity I need. We tried couple’s therapy, but he felt attacked. I’ve started individual therapy to understand whether I’m too insecure or if it’s his actions, but my therapist tends to validate my feelings.\nI have reached the point where I see every woman as a threat. I know his type by now (or I imagine that I know) and just a look at or ‘friendly’ dance with such a woman makes me feel nervous now. \n\nOne message keeps replaying: the ‘iffy’ girl he’d  dated just before me called me a “carnival queen” because of my glittery dress and asked if it had anything to do with him (being from Brazil). He ignored that and answered that next time he’ll go to a costume party, it will be a 80’s party and she replied “can’t wait to see your hair”. \nI was not wearing a custome. And we were gonna go to that aforementioned costume party together. I felt like at her part was subtle flirting. And I felt that my boyfriend was mocking me. \nI am now trying to sell that dress because it makes me embarrassed to even see it. That’s why I got sad today and made this post. \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my situation?\n\nAnd the “what if it was the other way around” doesn’t work. He doesn’t get jealous or insecure. \nWhen people describe us from the outside, they say he seems care very much for me and always show PDA. I think it would help to have an open phone policy. He just gets annoyed and upset when I ask for it which doesn’t support me in my healing. He thinks that we should we past this, by now.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend kept secretly in touch with exes/women he’s dated, downplays it as “friendly. Has stopped the behaviour now but thinks I should be over it by now. Doesn’t think that letting me see his phone until I gain trust or assure me when I get insecure is the answer. \nI’ve lost trust, feel mocked by his interactions, and don’t know if the issue is me or him.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We have been dating two years and have had a lot of ups and downs. In total during this time we have broke up briefly twice. Once was her decision and the other mine.\n\nLately I have been feeling so deeply intwined in the relationship that I don't know what is right sometimes. If she is making a fair point or if it's my fault. The last two weeks we have faced some difficulty centred around her saying we don't spend enough time together. \n\nNow we have both been busy with work so it was difficult to spend time together during the week. Although we usually spend the majority of the weekend together. The last weekend I met a friend on Thursday and had planned to see her early in the say before this and Friday but she cancelled both days citing work and tiredness as reasons. Then after she ended the conversation by reacting with an emoji to my text on Friday afternoon I proceeded to not hear from her until Saturday midday when she began asking why I hadn't contacted. She was upset and asking if something wrong and why I wasn't excited to see her. Considering I had made two previous attempts to see her and she said \"No\" I was figuring to give her space. But was planning to contact on Saturday afternoon if I didn't hear from her and also I was a bit lost considering I sent her four previous texts which she just reacted with a thumbs up.\n\nI used to overthink these interactions a lot but have been trying not to lately. She followed up by saying that she didn't understand how I wouldn't be texting her on Saturday or why I wasn't excited to see her. But I explained I was going to but was waiting to hear from her as she ended the conversation last time and I believe she wanted space. Additional to this I tried to see her the two previous days but she turned me down. So I met her Saturday evening and made us food and the same on Sunday. However she was cold and had even dumped some crafts I made her for a while ago on to the floor. I asked her why she done that and she said it was because she was annoyed at my absence and when I wasn’t excited to see her Saturday.\n\nThe rest of Sunday was fine and I had to leave because she was going out to meet friends. When going out the door she started getting short again and said \"you are leaving me again and can't wait to get away\". I replied in a very confused manner saying the obvious fact and that was because she had plans and asked me to literally leave 30 mins before that. She says that's not the point and that I'm always dying to get away from her or always trying to not spend time with her. \n\nI went home and she sent me a message summarising this again. I replied by saying No and that I always make my best effort and also plan dates etc aswell as citing recent examples. She suggested space for a few days and I said I agree with that. Then I left one last paragraph to explain my side a bit better and how much I care but she has left it on read since.\n\nI'm a bit lost on what to do and don't know if I'm really not doing well enough or she is expecting too much from me but it has really burned me out..\n\nExtra update : might I add in response to some of the initial posts that she has also said she now doesnt feel she has a platform to address things she is unhappy with.

One issue we need help with.\n\nHey y’all, normally my partner and I have been together for 4.5 years and can work through any issues we come across, given enough time and communication. There have been a couple issues we’ve come up on that no matter how much we talk about it, and plan, it always goes back to its old state.\n\nRecently due to health issues leading to financial issues, my partner, I, and our two kids (2 and 10 mo) needed to move in with her parents. Her parents are not good people,  I knew this before we got together, and her whole family is disrespectful to her and caters to an awful man because of traditional values. I’ve encouraged her to make Reddit posts about her family encounters but she doesn’t want to think about it all again which I understand. \n\nAll this to say, we have not been allowed to alter the house outside of the dining room and side room to make room for the 4 of us. We are allowed one shelf in the fridge and out of three bathrooms, we may use one as our bathroom and the other if we or the kids need bathing, our bathroom is a 1/2 bath. It was nice of them for allowing us to stay with them for the time being, but everyday they complain about something because we are there. Over the last couple months, we have not felt welcome here, us or the kids.\n\n Her parents are hoarders and my partner has been keeping up with it as much as she can so her dad doesn’t have to live in it. He would be doing more but is severely disabled, a spot he was put in both due to unfortunate events and his own decisions. Her mom doesn’t do anything around the house, often leaving food and dirty dishes everywhere that the three cats get into and get sick. Trash build in the garage and maggots are everywhere if my partner and I don’t take it out. Mold was in every room, most corners of rooms. My partner dealt with it best she could. Food expired months and years ago sitting in the fridge and cupboards. There’s so much more I could think of and further I can’t remember now.\nBefore I lost my job due to a tonic clonic seizure I had during my shift, and we moved in with her parents, my partner got a part time job in the restaurant industry and I have become a stay at home dad, my favorite job so far. \n\nMy partner was a stay at home mom while I was working and we had developed a system that worked for us at the apartment. I woke up early with the kids and let her sleep until she got up or I had to work, often 2-3 hours. We’d all hang out when I got home, and if the chores needed done before night, I’d knock em out because she liked to crochet while watching the kids and that’s harder to do while washing bottles. I’d do whatever remaining chores at the end of the night and go to bed with her when everything was done, and we both felt like it was a good balance, since the kids burn us out quicker than customers. \n\nNow that I stay home with the kids, we aren’t allowed to and can’t afford to baby proof entirely, I still get up with the kids and still have to find time to do housework. I can’t take my eyes off the 2 year old because no room is safe out of sight for even a few minutes. Because of my epilepsy, I have been doing housework in the morning instead of night because sleep deprivation is a big trigger for me and our 10 month old keeps us up all night. The kids usually wake up for 6:30-7:00 am to start the day, and anything they do will not wake my partner. They sleep in a modified dining room so attempts at making walls and doors to keep them in has been unsuccessful. We don’t have room or money for as many baby’s gates as we would need for their room, and is difficult with the room orientation. They have 3 bedrooms but both parents have their own rooms and the room her sibling stayed in growing up is closed off because of health hazards. Her sibling is the worst person we both know because of his past actions and current opinions. A Reddit post all in itself. \n\nGetting off track, it’s hard to watch kids anytime but in a dangerous house, it feels twice as difficult. Getting housework done while watching them feels impossible, a sentiment my partner shared, a reason I was fine seeing everything that I needed to do that night when I got home. They are a handful. Now I’m expected to do both or risk getting half the sleep I’d normally get after doing chores at night.\n\nWe’ve talked multiple times about her getting up in the morning with me and the kids so I can wash bottles for the baby before she goes to work. Dishes and trash if I have time. Or laundry, stocking diaper areas, prepping food, whatever I need to do. She agrees and the next morning I try to wake her up to be with us and it takes a few times, but she comes out. The next day maybe the same, after that not until we have another big discussion about it. Her meds do make her more tired and difficult to wake if she takes them later and I love her so I’ve been understanding.\n\nI completely get body chemistry being messed up on top of being exhausted. I also completely get me needing an extra hand to lessen stress and getting sleep, my biggest triggers for my epilepsy. I really don’t know what to do here. We have an amazing relationship that has been getting better by the week, (we all have off days) and I’m so proud of how far we have both come in becoming healthier people with more communication.\nI suppose this post is asking if anyone has been in a similar spot and how they handled it. \n\nAnyone been on meds that make them tired, and any tips or tricks learned through experience. I know she doesn’t want to feel tired all the time. These meds have been the only thing that has worked well for her with only minor side effects. Ultimately, I need to remind myself that eventually, there will be time even if it’s one bottle at a time, I just want to make sure I’m not building any resentment to the situation or her.\n\nI love my family more than anything, and I’d do anything for, but we’re in a tough spot and need some advice. If nothing else, it was nice expressing feeling about her parents a little. I talked to my partner and she agreed it might be good to ask for advice on this. What can we do in this situation?\nThanks for reading, and hopefully I won’t feel a need to post here again. I’ll clear up any confusion if this is seen by anyone. That you in advance\nTL:DR My partner and I need advice on how to get everything done with the kids and a house not ready for kids.

He’s been dealing with toxic family and work dynamics. He’s admitted that he’s extremely depressed.\n\nI feel as though our dynamic has changed, and it confuses me about my place within his life. I feel like I get hot and cold messaging from him, especially regarding when we will reconnect again in person. It stresses me out because I feel like I’m in an emotional limbo.

To me, that could happen regardless of distance and it’s inevitable that outside forces become enmeshed in our daily interactions. I’m not excusing his actions, but he has dealt with a lot the past month outside of our relationship that did affect his mental health, which he admitted to me. However, I feel frustrated because I don’t understand who I am to him. I am his girlfriend, but I feel pushed away. I feel like he can be normal with his friends, and hang out and talk to them and have fun, but then comes to me, and takes out his frustration on me, while leaving me behind.\n\nFor now, I’ve stepped back from the relationship to protect myself and to give him space to figure out his feelings.

Please tell me what to do.\n\nJust to provide a context: we have been together for 10 months, and even though it wasn't always like that, it was mostly really happy. My girlfriend is a really nice person, but is very prone to get hurt due to her insecurities. She gets vulnerable real soon with almost anyone showing her a hint of kindness or respect towards her, only to get hurt by many people taking advantage of her kindness. For example, there was this one time she had my phone and I left without it for home, and she then felt so guilty I had to come back from home to our university's hostel where she lives so I can collect it, that she wrote me a letter of apology, me being her boyfriend and I wasn't even slightly angry with her. But I didn't know what to make out from a letter of apology because I really never expect anyone to do that, let alone my girlfriend. She gets hurt from her one friend who gaslights her a lot, and her other friends who don't directly hurt her, usually are distanced from her for reasons unknown. And she is just utterly confused if it's because of her that people are moving away. \n\nNow, coming to now, so a guy, who is 2 years senior to her, apparently a nice guy texts her since she is part of this student society which the guy is a head of. He is nice to her, so she opens up a little and tells about the TV shows she watches and asks if he watches them. Then at some point she thought she is being annoying to the guy so she texts him \"Am I being stupid to talk to you like a friend? Can you be honest about how annoyed are you on a scale from 0 to 10\" and the guy without hesitation replies \"6 lol\" and she is immediately like \"sorry\". She has her university examinations going on at this time, and this just immediately made her call her mother and cry to her. I felt so bad hearing this. \n\nSo, now, after seeing her messages what she texted him, it seemed to me she was quickly attaching to someone, she asked me why does it happen to her, and I was initially trying to just coax her that the guy was just a dick. But then, she insisted I be honest with her and I told her message might come across as \"being desperate\" sometimes, and that was just the nail on the coffin. I tried to clarify with her that people treat her on the basis of how we project ourselves, but nothing could be done. I made a comment on her personality, and i shouldn't have done that, I know that. \n\nI hope anyone can suggest me how I can rectify this now, and in the future, because I really love her, and I really didn't mean to hurt her on purpose.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/Expensive-Boss-8581_794", "user": "u/Expensive-Boss-8581", "text": "Unsure about my relationship (20F, 21M)\n\nHi Reddit, I need some outside perspective.\n\nI (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for almost 2 years. Earlier this year (around Feb–July), our relationship was really rocky. We were constantly fighting, and we even took several “breaks.” During those breaks, he mostly played video games and spent money on in-game stuff, while I kept trying to express my feelings. The frustrating part is that he’d sometimes listen once, but then go back to old habits, which made me feel like he never really tried for our relationship.\n\nAnother issue is that he often says one thing, but the reality is something else. For example, he’ll say “A,” but then it turns out to be “B.” When I confront him, he either says he “forgot” or claims he was just saying things randomly. This has made it really hard for me to trust him, because I never know if he’s being genuine.\n\nBy June, we decided to take a month-long break. At the end of July, we got back together and things were okay… for a week. Then I found out he had subscribed to OnlyFans during the months we were fighting. He knows how I feel about porn/OF. I’ve told him I don’t see the point when he already has a partner in real life. Pornhub I might still understand, but paying for OF feels more extreme and disrespectful to me. It made me feel like I had no dignity as his girlfriend. Because this happened during our fighting moments, I forgave him. And since then he stopped watching.\n\nOn top of that, I have weird feelings about his relationship with his mom. I know every family shows affection differently, and his dad passed away, so maybe that explains part of it. But he still hugs her a lot, cuddles her, pecks her neck, and sometimes even compares me to her (like saying my hair smells like hers). When she visited our country, he held her hand and left me walking behind them, which felt strange. I’m torn between feeling sympathy for her (since she’s a widow and very attached to her youngest son) and feeling uneasy because I worry he won’t prioritize me in the future.\n\nFor context: I come from a loving family too, but our way of showing affection has clear boundaries. We don’t cuddle or kiss, but we’re very close in a healthy way.\n\nThat being said, I’m not saying he’s the world’s worst boyfriend. Whenever he visits me, he pays for meals, groceries, and sometimes even my shopping. He often helps me with chores like laundry, dishes, and cleaning my room. He also makes the effort to visit me despite us being semi–long distance (it’s a 2–3 hour bus ride, and he usually comes twice a month). He even kept visiting during our constant fighting phase.\n\nPlease keep in mind that every single issue I’ve mentioned here, I have already addressed with him directly. He always says “okay” but his actions don’t always follow. Recently, his mom has been texting him a lot, but he’s been responding very slowly because from what I’ve seen he’s been trying to spending all his free time with me.\n\nAt this point, I’m stuck because I don’t know if this relationship is actually healthy or if I’m just forcing something that isn’t working. How do I know when it’s worth continuing to try, versus when it’s better to walk away?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We've been together for nearly a decade now and for the most part we have a perfect relationship. The healthiest and most wonderful relationship I have ever been in, she too feels the same. There have been a few minor arguments and problems, but for the most part all is wonderful. A few days ago, however, her ex husband and father of two of her children, both now grown and in their early twenties died in a car wreck. They have been divorced for 17 years and what little i have heard her say about him was all bad. On multiple occasions, she said she hated him. However, she is really upset about his death. She has been crying and seems distant. She thought me asleep a couple nights ago, but i wasn't. She was texting a friend of hers that knew them when they were together. (My fiance and her ex husband) I saw her text that she is having a hard time dealing with it, that it is so confusing to her, that she didn't think it would upset her so, and that she didn't know what to feel. The day after he died, she asked if I remembered a friend of hers that onced stayed with us a few weeks about 6 years ago. She showed me pictures of her and said she was apparently doing adult content stuff. I didn't think anything of it. Well in that conversation that she didn't know i witnessed, she mentioned to the friend she was talking to that she (the friend who stayed with us and she showed me the risqué pics of) started dating him 3 years before and was living with him ( the ex husband). She(my fiance)then said, and i quote \"yeah, it's been a rough 3 years\" referencing the fact that her friend was dating her ex husband. She has never mentioned this to me, nor did she mention it when showing me the pics, the day after his death. I feel like she's lying, keeping secrets. I feel a bit betrayed. I know it's not fair for me to be angry at her for her feelings, nor to make another's death about me. Yet, I can't help feeling hurt that she obviously still had strong enough feelings, not from his death so much, but to be upset by her friend dating him. I feel like she shouldn't care at all about who he dates, or what he does. The fact that she kept this from me is the worst part, to me at least. Am I being an asshole for feeling like this? I don't think so. I believe that she should be open with me, completely honest about her feelings and she should have talked to me about these things that so obviously bother her.

It’s a bit jumbled and all over the place. \n\nBackground - we started dating at 16 and the start of our relationship was rocky to say the least. We were in college at the time, and then we ended up going to the same university in our hometown. We are now both graduated - he got on to a really good graduate scheme at a good company in a job he likes, pays well. I went on to do a Masters at the same university. We have a lot of mutual friends and hang out with our guy friends quite a bit. \n\nI won’t go into too much detail because I don’t want this to be more lengthy than it already is, but he has continually disrespected me throughout our relationship and I think I’ve finally come to terms that maybe I should leave him. I always loved him so much and so I always thought he would just grow out of it as he matured, but even outside of his mistakes he still doesn’t really treat me well. He has made a number of mistakes throughout the years, including one recently which I will explain, and now I have done something bad too. \n\nLast winter time (Dec 2024) one of our guy friends (20M), I’ll call him Ed, invited 2 girl friends that he knew to our weekly pub quiz night. I only went to these pub quizzes occasionally, not every time. The first time they were invited, I wasn’t there. My boyfriend told me about it and said they were really young (18, but looked 16 apparently) and it was awkward he had invited them. I eventually met them a couple weeks later, and I agreed it was awkward. The guys gave them the nicknames of Pinky and Porky (a little demeaning, but this is what I will use as their names in this story). I saw them when I was in the bathroom and Pinky was being friendly and complimented my jeans, and we had a quick chat. Porky didn’t say much. The months went on, and they started hanging out with these two girls a lot more. Sometimes I was there, sometimes I wasn’t. I got bad vibes from Porky, and I could tell she had a crush on my boyfriend. It got to a point where he was flirting with her in front of my face. I let it slide for a while, because he is a ‘flirty person’. But I started feeling uncomfortable around them and so whenever we would plan something, I would ask my boyfriend not to invite them. He always gave the excuse that Ed had invited them and it wasn’t his fault. But then it became very obvious that he wanted them there too. On his call logs, he had called Porky on many different occasions. He even used to call her in front of me and would basically beg her to come. He invited just her (Pinky was busy) to his birthday party (just a house party at a free house with a few friends). I arrived late to this party, to find her sat there on her phone looking a little embarrassed (there were other people at this party who had never met her and didn’t know who she was). She left pretty soon after I arrived and said her friend had an emergency. I spoke to my bf and said why on earth did he invite her. He started getting defensive about it, and I started to get pissed off. This is March time by the way. I would say to him I don’t understand why he always invited her to stuff, including when I wasn’t there, and said I thought it was really weird considering she’s 18 too. He started to gaslight me and also made me feel like a bitch. He said I was just being awkward and I had no reason to dislike her. \n\nHe came to mine one weekend, and I saw he had makeup on his jumper. I knew immediately it was from her, as they had been to the pub that week. I asked him about it and acted confused at first, but then said she had hugged him at the pub because something happened with her family and she was upset. I later found out she drove him home that night, just those two in the car. \n\nFast forward to the end of June, she added me on snapchat and then sent me a message a few days after. I was out with friends (not close friends) when I opened the message. I felt so sick to my stomach, and couldn’t hold in my tears. It completely ruined my weekend. I spoke to my boyfriend over the phone when i got back to my hotel room and he was with our guy friends back at home. He already knew what had happened somehow and he was very apologetic. He said he “knows how it looks” but said that she is lying and exaggerating. To keep it brief, she had said that: he was being inappropriate with her, had tried to kiss her twice in the car, had made a comment saying ‘everyone thinks we want to shag eachother’ and that they should do it and ‘it would be great,’ and had called her one night asking her what she was wearing and then tried to facetime her. On the phone, I then asked him individually if each thing happened. He basically admitted to most of it but said it ‘didn’t happen like that’ and was out of context. He denied trying to kiss her. He said he doesn’t recall the phone call asking what she is wearing etc. But he has a bad drinking habit and gets quite drunk, so it is possible he just doesn’t remember this.\n\nHonestly there is more I could say about that situation, but it’s long enough as it is. I saw him the following day, though we didn’t get to speak about it much because we were with his family. Turns out he had known for a week that Pinky was going to message me, but never said anything to me about it. I felt fed up and drained, and it felt different to the other times things like this had happened. He asked if I wanted to break up with him, and I said no. He even said at one point that I “should probably break up with him”. \n\nThe following weekend I went to Italy, sort of a business trip but I can’t go into too much detail. There were a lot of people there around my age and it was a super fun week. I met a guy (26M) there, and I wasn’t looking for it but the connection just happened. I was drunk on the last night of the trip and felt unwell. He looked after me, got me water and held my hair back when I was almost being sick. I fell asleep on him lay down outside and he gave me a very quick kiss on the lips before he left. He admitted he had feelings for me but understood the situation with my boyfriend (I had explained the situation to him briefly). We had chemistry, and even other people had noticed it. \n\nI think he has some qualities that my boyfriend doesn’t, like patience, calmness and understanding. I have been messaging him since then (since july) and have sexted him multiple times. We also met up in London (another sort-of business trip) and ended up kissing more passionately. We both wanted to have sex but I said we couldn’t as i would feel far too guilty. I still feel guilty now, but i haven’t stopped talking to him. I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t live in my country although it’s a very short and cheap plane journey. I will be seeing him again in November, and it’s all I can think about. \n\nWhat I have done is now worse than anything my bf has ever done. But i think the continuous breaking my trust has whittled me down. Up until this point, I was always extremely loyal and was definitely more good than he deserved. Now I don’t have a leg to stand on, I don’t even really know what I want, and I don’t know what to do. We were planning to move out together as soon as I got a job and we had basically planned our whole lives together. I still love him of course, but I think my attraction for him faded a while ago, and just seems to fade more every time he does something. This is probably an underlying issue I have been avoiding for a while. It is something he has noticed too (and this was even before I met the new guy). I feel guilty and confused, and the new guy treats me like how I feel I deserve to be treated. I am very attracted to him and I am worried I will not be able to resist sleeping with him in November. But if I do, I will of course feel guilty. \n\nI have spoken to all my friends and even my mum about this. They all agree I should end it with my bf, although my mum thinks I should continue with my boyfriend for the time being because this is a stressful period for me, with my masters etc. She said it’s a shame the new guy doesn’t live closer, and that I should just “keep my eyes open” for other people. She also said I should not tell my bf about the situation, under any circumstances. \n\nSorry this is so long :/ I just feel lost and I’m pissed off that I was right about Porky all along and was gaslight about it. They have obviously cut off Pinky and Porky now, but as I said my boyfriend keeps making mistakes like these. \n\nNow I’m talking to this new guy, the relationship clearly isn’t sustainable anymore. I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t know if the relationship is worth trying to save, because I do still love him. I wonder if I haven’t tried enough and that I’m giving up on him when I shouldn’t.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/ThrowRAStarfi_801", "user": "u/ThrowRAStarfi", "text": "My (29M) Boyfriend told me he isn't as into me (26NB) as I am him. I'm now doubting our relationship.\n\nHello,\n\nI'm trying to work out something with myself that feels complex but may be much simpler since I tend to over think. When I first started crushing on my current boyfriend of 3 months we had already been friends for 3 years at that point. He was aware of my queerness and identity well before we dated. Always respected my pronouns and we value a lot of the same beliefs.\n\nWhen it first started I could hardly get him out of my head. Sketchbooks littered with drawings of him, playlists dedicated to every moment, etc. Our beginning wasn't anything to be proud of since it started with intercourse. Most conversations lingered on people or characters we found attractive and one thing led to another.\n\nI was just over the moon to have his attention so I didn't mind. Feelings and confessions came after the fact and were initiated by me. The following dates and conversations were phenomenal and our intimacy skyrocketed. \n\nHowever, he admitted something to me that hurt my feelings an awful lot. That I am more obsessed/into him than he is with me. Some friends have even stated it's a bad sign when a (AMAB) isn't more into you (AFAB) off the bat. I've brushed this off considering I don't identify with my assigned gender but now this thought has intensified after he said that to me.\n\nHe prefers to call me his girlfriend - which before I didn't mind since I also like the way it sounds. Loves my more feminine outfits and getups. Any sexual media we consume together is 90% straight since he doesn't enjoy masc/men. Now I'm putting it all under a microscope. \n\nDoes he really genuinely like me for me or is it because of my body? Was he ever actually into me or did he take advantage of the fact I was hopelessly in love? I want to say no since he does tell me he loves me but when I dig deeper it's the same response or a complete lack of action.\n\nHe says he loves me for my kindness and that I'm funny. That I'm pretty. That I don't judge him for who he is. When he asks me the same I do my best to paint a mosaic of feelings I struggle to verbalize. Always changing it up to show him how much I really feel when I'm around him. \n\nThis seems to genuinely make him happy so I love to do it but I do feel a bit let down when he doesn't put forth the same effort. Same with footing the bill for food or gift giving. He is much more reserved and gives simple gifts (I had to ask for flowers even though I had given him flowers prior without being asked) or a split the bill kind of person. I'm far more exuberant in gift giving and often take over the tab. I'm not looking to be treated like a woman but it would be nice to know he thinks of me without being asked.\n\nNow I don't know how I feel and I can't find the courage to ask him in a way that wouldn't offend him. I don't believe this would break our relationship but it does give me a sense that we may not be on the same wavelength.\n\nTLDR;\nBoyfriend of 3 months (friend of 3 years prior) said I'm more obsessed/into him than he is with me. This hurt my feelings and now I'm questioning everything and feel insecure in our relationship. I am also having doubts that my boyfriend really loves me and that he only sees me as a woman when I identify as NB.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I've started to notice that when we talk, it's always about things my bf is interested in, or sometimes things we both like. When I try to share something I like, he just nods or hums along, until the theme switches to something else and then he gets more talkative. When he talks I ask questions, I give my POV (which is usually shut down), I remember, and I ask about the evolution of the situation later.\n\nSo when there is a conversation going, it's mostly about him venting about work, about what's troubling him, about his favorite shows (some of them we both like), about his projects, telling me he's hungry so that we figure out dinner...\n\nHe rarely remembers when I say something. For example: when we started doing it unprotected (we both are tested and clean, I'm using birth control), I told him I didn't like the feeling of it driping out afterwards and asked for something to clean myself. He brought it, and all was fine. But I keep asking for it all the time. One night, he got up after the deed, went to the bathroom... flushed, washed his hand, drunk some water, and came back for cuddles. I had to ask him again if I could have something to clean up without dripping everywhere on the way to the bathroom. (we always do it at his place, as I still live with my family)\n\nThe tipping point to me posting this on reddit was when he wanted me to spend the night at his place yesterday. I said no, as we always sleep late and I don't sleep well there, and that I have music reharshal (after work) the next day that I won't be able to do efficiently if I'm too tired. And I added that we can have a sleepover the next night or the night after that.\n\nHe send back a \"U_u\". And I thought: what I am supposed to answer to that? So I didn't text back, and the next message was that evening, where he asked me to send him a pic I took of him so he could use it for his buisness\n\nI do not want to give up on this relationship. Not without even trying to talk to him about it, see how he reacts and if he really tries to change a bit. Because I think he does like me and just has no idea I feel ignored.

We became friends, but there was always a certain attraction between us. We would hug each other, eat together, and things like that. I had recently ended a relationship, and since we're coworkers, we cleared things up and said nothing could happen between us.\n\nOver time, we continued to go out and spend more time together, until one time, when we were drinking alcohol and I tried to kiss her. She rejected me. I didn't take it the wrong way, since it was what we had agreed upon. We continued to hang out just as friends, always with a certain amount of tension, and with caresses and cuddles. Until last Friday, I accompanied her and we were hugging on the company bus. When I said goodbye, I took the taxi home and received a message from her saying she appreciated my company and such. Finally, she said, \"But sometimes I feel like a kiss.\"\n\nThen she deleted the message. We called that night, and I invited her out Wednesday after work. She told me that after what I'd said, we couldn't go out like that again, but that I could still go with her like that day.\n\nNow, yesterday (Monday), we talked, and I brought up the subject of Wednesday, and she said no because she didn't see it as likely that she'd stay (she leaves work at 4 pm, but sometimes stays until 5 pm, plus we work in different locations, so I can go to her location to work there). I also saw an email from her from work that she sent at 5 pm, so she did stay at least that day.

It seems very deep and serious. \nHe's already getting all the help he needs from therapy to medication, and I go to therapy too. \n\nSome time ago we met around 4 or 5 times a week, but now we're meeting around 2 times a week (per his request), and when we do, it's great, we can talk, he opens up a little bit (not a lot either), sex is going great etc\n\nBut when we're apart, we barely talk at all.

He's made some big decisions that I only knew afterwards because he doesn't text. That made me feel like an afterthought, like I'm a \"decoration\" in his life.

We talked about him being more present in texts, but so far nothing's changed. \n\nI'm trying to understand what's he's going through and to be there for him but I'm starting to worry that I'm clinging to his potential.

It is a long distance thing for now, as we live 5 hours apart but we met and had an amazing connection, we can talk for hours about deep stuff, and for me this is so hard to find in the gay community. And yeah we only met 2 weeks ago but that's just how strong our connection was, we talk all day every day, and he's even interested in moving close to me or me moving close to him in the next ~3 months if things go well. If he's talking about that then I would think he would want to delete the apps. He's the one taking things to the next level, asking me to be his boyfriend, talking about moving in eventually, but with the apps on his phone. I was the one to tell him we just met, let's get to know each other for a while then we can think about moving in.\n\n\nOr is this where I'm exhausting? Is it okay to be in an exclusive relationship and still use dating and hookup apps? Because I always thought that was a no-no.\n\n\nTLDR: new bf has dating apps still on his phone, despite me telling him it makes me uncomfortable/insecure. Am  I the problem?

We got together in school due to mutual friends and she lives practically right next to me so we meet everyday for at least 2-3 hours and its very rare that we dont meet, at the start of our relationship my gf was having some issues due to her anxiety and it was a lot to handle for me because she had many panic attacks, sudden distrust in everyone and everything so it was a rocky ride at the start of our relationship but at that time i didnt mind helping her out through her problems ( i still dont but it has started taking its toll), but otherwise the relationship has been going pretty well, she has met almost all my family members and they all like her and her parents also trust me so theres nothing wrong there as well. \n\nHere are where the problems start:\nWe were at a party where i confessed to her about my feelings and she said she feels the same way as well, but during the same night she made out with me and my best friend and her excuse was she was too drunk to know what she was doing (she was she blacked out later) so idky but i was like fine happens. Due to this I dont like the way she behaves when she drinks even today because she feels drinking alcohol is a great excuse to do anything and everything ( i dont think she has cheated on me other than that instance). She acts like a child all the time like shes some 10 year old kid who constantly needs attention, we have had a conversation on how i dont give her the amount of attention she needs even though i make it a point to meet her everyday no matter what. Last year the day before birthday i was planning a surprise so i was in contact with her mom to plan everything and when i was talking to her mom she told me that she has gone to meet a friend lets call him jack, now when she left my place she told me she was going home and then when i texted her what are you doing she didnt reply for 30 mins and when she did she said she was with her mom. This Jack guy has been a source of friction in our relationship because he is a 24 yr old man now and they were friends before we started dating but Jack used to kiss her on her neck and she used to lie on top of him and shit. Recently we were talking about what we want in our future and i told her that i want kids for sure and she said she doesn’t want kids for sure. Although everything i mentioned here i have talked to her about it as well and a lot of time has passed but it still stings me to this very day. She doesn’t take life seriously at all she doesn’t want to learn anything that will help her like cooking, doing basic shit on a laptop and other minimal things which really pisses me off because i learned everything by myself because i knew that these skills are necessary for survival and will be needed when we move out from our parent’s place but she wants to live like a kid whose work is done by the people around them \n\nI do love my girlfriend but i can feel it lessening day by day. Recently she got a text from jack (they had stopped talking for 7-8 months they had a fight) and she reacted like she got a text from her ex and subtle things like this are making me doubt this even more. Idk who will read this but i wanted to rant because i have never said this to anyone before. \n\nPs: this is my first post so sorry for the mistakes", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Is that fair?\n\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now and we live in Nashville, TN. I’m originally from MA and she’s from Austin, TX but we both met here in Nashville shortly after each moving here. We currently live together and have made plans for travel and our future together but keep running into issues on where we’ll live.\nOver the past few months, she has been getting more and more set on moving back to Texas because she said she always planned on it and that’s where her family is. She is very close with her family and talks to them on the phone nearly every day. I’m not very close with my family that still lives up in New England but I still love them.\nWe both are to the point where we want to leave Nashville and live somewhere else, I want to move out west to the mountains because I lived there for 6 months previously and loved it. She told me she was only open to Denver and for 1-2 years at the most. I want to get my masters degree while out west because there’s a lot more education opportunities there with virtually none in Nashville for my field. I’m working remote in an unrelated field that I don’t love and have put my plans on hold for her until she was ready to leave Nashville.\n\nWe then talked about moving to maybe Charleston after Denver and settling down there but now she is saying that she can’t suppress the feeling of missing her parents anymore. She needs to be near them and wants to be close enough to have causal random dinners and be at everything. She said I’m the only thing keeping her from her dream of moving back to Texas and being happy. She pitched it as doing 2 years there as her 2 yr choice when she was previously very against moving around again, but I know it’ll turn into more than 2 years\nShe wants to do it right around the time we’d have kids so her parents can help take care of them, but after 2yrs I doubt she’s just going to be ok uprooting and leaving. I think she’s hoping we get so tied down that we won’t end up leaving. And I fear if I do convince her to go, the feeling of not being close to her family will come back and she’ll resent me for it. She insists this won’t be true but I’m very skeptical\nNo part of me wants to move to Austin, I’m a very outdoorsy person and need to be close to the beach or mountains and Austin has neither. Even Nashville is too far away from the mountains or beach for me and Austin is worse. I also can’t stand the weather, I have a serious heart condition and feel the heat more than most, Nashville summers are brutal super hot and humid and I hate not being able to enjoy being outside from end of May to mid September, meanwhile Austin will be even worse and longer. Plus there is nothing for me, no friends, no family, no mountains or beach, and the career I want won’t be possible from there. My gf doesn’t seem to care she told me I can get a remote job and work, implying to keep doing the career I do now that I don’t enjoy.\n\nI don’t know if we’re compatible, I feel like I have so much to live for and so many dreams. I don’t want my future decided by where an elderly couple want to live because before she was saying she was moving to where they were when they were looking at potentially moving out of Texas. It feels wrong to spend my life chasing where ever they decide to live, but she seems dead set on it and I’ll never be enough and the family we create won’t be enough", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We’ve been together for 6 years. She’s loyal, caring, thoughtful, and lovely with my family. I also get along very well with her family, who are genuinely lovely. Her dad is a kind man.\n\nBut I feel there’s a big lack of respect and fairness, especially around money:\n\n* I earn \\~£150k and pay for everything (rent, bills, food, outings, wedding deposit). She’s a high-earning lawyer but saves most of her money.\n* She went ahead and bought her parents a house without telling me, while we were looking for one together. She calls my flat “ugly” and says this is the lowest point of her life.\n* Her long-term plan is that I buy our marital home while she invests in her parents’ house. If we split, she keeps hers, but could still claim part of mine.\n* She forwarded me a £1,500 wedding bill (I’d already paid £500). When I asked why and to split, she got angry and hasn’t spoken to me for two days (today is the third).\n* She told me my mum should take a loan to help pay for our wedding. My mum works part-time, lives in a small flat with my brother, while my dad is divorced, disabled, and living with my grandma. This comment really broke me and if she after said she did not really mean it that was a joke, but still expects me to pay as she did not mention anything about splitting it.\n\nI know I’m not perfect. I can be sarcastic when frustrated, and I’ve been vocal about her brother because I feel he mostly benefits himself. Nobody is perfect. But I feel, especially in the past year, she is stingy, ungrateful, and doesn’t respect me.\n\nI love her and I love her family, but after 6 years I’m asking myself: if it feels like this now, will it only get worse after marriage?\n\n**Question:** Has anyone been in a similar position? How do you know when it’s time to walk away, even when your faith makes it so hard?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Lengthy version:**\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m a Catholic man (30) from the UK, engaged to a woman (32). We’ve been together for 6 years. I’ve always wanted a family and thought she was the one. I work hard, earn well (\\~£150k), and I’ve always been generous in relationships, maybe too much at times. She’s a good partner in many ways: loyal, caring, looks after me when I’m sick, gives thoughtful gifts, and gets along with my mum.\n\nBut lately I feel there is a lack of respect, especially around money, and I’m starting to question everything.\n\n# Finances and fairness\n\nFrom the start, I’ve covered nearly everything: rent, bills, food, outings. She’s a high-earning lawyer but saves most of her income and contributes very little. I’m saving for our first house and told her we either need a prenup and the house will me for us but only me as owner or we start splitting things fairly. If one day she stays home with kids, of course I’ll support her fully. But right now, it feels very one-sided and she does not seem to appreciate it. She says a prenup means I already expect divorce, which isn’t true. I just want fairness and respect.\n\n# Stories that made me worried\n\n* **When I needed help** Once, when I needed help with a house deposit, she told me to borrow from her brother instead of offering her savings. That stuck with me.\n* **Her house plan** Her long-term idea was that I buy our marital home, while she later buys a house for her parents to rent. That way, if things go badly, she keeps her investment fully, while legally she could still claim part of mine.\n* **Buying a house without me** She went ahead and bought her parents a house without telling me (FYI they already lived in a family owned house, just they wanted bigger one and cannot get mortgage because they are old), while we were also looking for one together. She keeps calling my flat small and ugly, said this was the lowest point of her life, and told me “all men provide for women.\", for context this is the best flat I had, I lived with flatmates before this, been almost homeless and moved 12 times in 8 years. Also about house chores, we do a good 50/50, maybe 60/40 on her doing the 60, but I have good robot hoover and mopper, washing machine, etc. and we pretty much split, she never cleans the toilet, mostly me and I rarely do dishes, mostly her.\n* **Wedding bill** We got a £1,500 bill for the venue (I had already paid £500 deposit, which will be wasted if we cancel the venue). She just forwarded it to me. When I asked why she didn’t handle it, she got angry. Since then, she has ignored me for two days instead of answering my question: “What are your expectations in this relationship?”\n* **The car mess** We used to have her dad’s petrol car. Then her brother swapped it with an EV, which made my commute a nightmare. I eventually bought my own petrol car just to cope. Now the EV sits unused, still costing expensive PCP debt, but she insists it counts as her “contribution.”\n* **Gifts and sacrifices** I’ve spoiled her with expensive gifts (Gucci, jewellery, makeup) and even took out a loan for her diamond ring. Meanwhile, she hasn’t made similar sacrifices for us.\n* **Her family** I’ve asked her not to give money to her brother without telling me first. She still does it behind my back or only after, which creates tension.\n\n# My part in this\n\nI know I’m not perfect. I can be sarcastic when I’m frustrated, and I’ve been vocal about her brother because I feel he mostly benefits himself. Maybe I don’t always communicate in the best way and I know I should not gossip on her brother, but she is against prenup and her money are a mystery to me, so even though I might have to focus on her and not her family, I did the mistake.\n\nBut I also believe nobody is perfect. In her case, I see that she can be very stingy with money, and lately she has been unrespectful and ungrateful.\n\nOne comment that really shook me was when she said my mum should take a loan to help pay for our wedding. My mum lives abroad, works part-time, and shares a small flat with my brother. My dad is divorced, disabled, and living with my grandma. I’ve been open with my fiancée about my family being poor, lower working class. For her to suggest my mum take on debt for our wedding really hurt, and it made me think seriously about breaking up.\n\n# Her family\n\nThis part makes it harder. We are very close to her family. We’ve gone on trips together, and they are genuinely lovely. They invite me every weekend for dinner or days at the beach. Her dad is a veteran and a kind man, but his daughter, my fiancée, feels entitled and lately disrespectful. I feel sad about the idea of rejecting her and, by extension, distancing myself from them. That is part of why I am writing this as if I was a father and she would be my daughter, it would make me sad that her fiancé broke up.\n\n# Where I’m at\n\nAfter 6 years together, I don’t want to make her sound all bad. She does have good qualities and I love her. But the financial imbalance, the lack of respect, and comments like the one about my mum feel bigger than just “little arguments.” If this is how things are now, I worry it will only get worse after marriage. Also, she moved in and I accepted her, even though she has a family here, I do not feel like asking her to leave, she threaten a few time she will leave forever and I told her to do so, she is free to do whatever she wants, but she is still here. I would look for this house and move myself if the situation does not work and she can to what she likes with this flat (probably will move to her parents if she needs to pay the rent and bills).\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? How do you know when it’s time to walk away, even when your faith makes it so hard?\n\nP.S. Everything I wrote she already knows it, so I did not write here something I did not tell her, I even told her about breaking up, that if she is so unhappy here she is not trapped, she is a free woman and can do whatever she wants. I know it's bad to say, but she being hostile, made me also hostile.

I'm losing my patience. \nMy wife and I have been married and living together for a little over a year now. Our Mutual friend, let's call her Jane, is really my wife's friend that gradually became mine due to the closeness of my wife and hers relationship. They have been friends a little over 4 years now, and they've had a lot of falling outs during that time, but always came back together. Jane had recently gone through a very difficult time due to an ex breaking things off suddenly, Jane not being on the lease and that ex effectively kicking her out. She had no where else to go. My wife and I opened our home to her. I didn't mind that she was in clear need of comfort the first night and ended up sleeping in our bed. She was exhausted both emotionally and physically. We all slept in the bed that night with my wife sandwiched in the middle. We talked and made sure everyone was comfortable with that, and that was fine. I was under the assumption that Jane would know that wasn't going to be every night, especially not knowing how long she's staying. I still would like alone time with my wife, for certain reasons I'm sure most would understand but another reason of just plain simple quality time. I work nights, so often times my wife and I will watch movies or play video games late at night when I get home, and we cuddle and maybe we move on to some extra curricular activities. It's not always a guarantee and it's not always the point. Sometimes a good makeout session is good enough. But my wife doesn't really like doing any of the more intimate things, (especially the main event) with Jane in our bed. And I'm also really uncomfortable with that for obvious reasons. After a couple weeks I was getting irritated, so I got the living room set up for her to sleep in there. We had a conversation, she said she understood and that was that. She slept in there for one night and then found somewhere else to be. Then that didn't pan out for whatever reason, and she came back. I maintained the boundary of her sleeping in the living room which went fine. I thought we all understood and everything was kosher. Well, Jane had left for a few nights again, and then came over this morning and had asked to stay til Wednesday (? Maybe Thursday. Not sure.) And we said that would be fine. Except now, I'm working tonight, and Jane had asked if we set up the living room to my wife, which we had not. Jane then said \"oh its fine I can sleep in the bedroom\". Which my wife had misinterpreted and said that's fine. For context, we have 2 bedrooms, the 2nd bedroom is for our kids. Jane also has 2 kids who have been with her. My wife thought Jane meant in the room with the kids, which is fine. But then Jane went to OUR bedroom and set up her kids playpen in there for the night. My wife didn't want to fight her or make a big deal out of it, and is begging me to just leave it, but I am not comfortable with this. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how was the situation handled? I don't want to blow up their friendship or burn any bridges, but I want to sleep in my bed comfortably, and I really don't want to have to keep dealing with this every time she stays over, regardless of the reasoning. \n\n\n(Edit: Context): My wife is bi. There was a time where Jane and her were interested in each other, and I gave them a window for extracurricular activities between the 2 of them. They didn't do anything aside from flirting and simple kisses. It became clear that Jane didn't have the ability to initiate and my wife is not one to initiate either. Honestly it was painful to watch them attempt things. For multiple reasons. I thought maybe it would be hot or something but realized I'm very territorial over my partners and I didn't like the way it made me feel. And on the other end, neither of them actually acted on it, so it felt rather pointless after 2 or 3 months.\nAnyway, we all had a long conversation about the feelings and how I learned that wasn't something I was okay with and put new boundaries in place to prevent anyone from getting hurt. I apologized for putting them in an awkward situation as well because even tho it was an experiment, it's not like there weren't real feelings involved for them as well. I'm very positive my wife wouldn't cheat on me having been a victim of it herself in previous relationships.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She attends the church I go to, the gym I go to, and even the volleyball team I go to and sometimes barbecues. (We have a lot of friends in common) So, we see each other often. We don't talk about anything important beyond greeting each other.\n\nEven we have several friends in common, I try not to mingle with her too much. Today, she's married with a daughter. She's had a crush on me since we were kids, and we dated for six months when we were 15. We broke up without a fight and without much explanation from either side, drifted apart, and never spoke again. Apparently, she doesn't hold any anger or resentment toward me. I don't hold that against her. Even before she moved to the neighborhood, she tried three times to add me on Instagram, but I wouldn't let her. Lately, she's been trying to get my attention online. She posts songs and stories about love, regret, and so on. She tried and tried to be friends with my wife, but she wouldn't let her get too close. They get along well, but they're just colleagues who don't talk much.  \n\nThe strange thing is that she tried to contact me in a rather strange way, like... One time she called me but hung up in the middle of the night. Another day in the middle of the night she changed the topic of the Instagram chat to \"my darling,\" then \"pizza,\" and then she deleted me from Instagram. Four months later, she tried to add me back on Instagram, but I wouldn't let her. Another day she sent me an Instagram message with just a period and then a comma, and after I saw it, she deleted it. These days, at night, she posts songs about breakups, regret, but sometimes she posts other songs that are too late, etc. (Maybe the songs aren't even for me, but I'm assuming so because after I see them, she always deletes her story). What the hell does she want? Does she want to be confronted? Does she want to resolve the past? I haven't responded or spoken to her about it because I really don't know what to do. Please help me because my situation is truly bizarre. I've thought about asking her why all this in person, but her husband is always around, and I don't want to create any awkwardness.  I wouldn't like to ask online because I also think it's risky and it's not the same as talking in person.

Is this grounds for a breakup?\n\nI’ll try to provide as much context and information as possible without making this too long. Before getting into the situation, here’s some background: I recently went through some medical complications with my Copper IUD. While it didn’t cause any permanent issues, it was enough for me to decide to discontinue birth control. I have various chronic medical conditions, and I decided that adding the possibility of additional complications wasn’t worth it. Before I had it removed, I was open and honest with my boyfriend that I wouldn’t be getting a new IUD and that we would have to go back to condoms, which we used for over six months before I got the IUD. We’ve been together for almost five years, and while I thought we were on the same page, this has been an issue ever since.\n\nAnytime I try to have an open conversation about different ways we can both meet our needs and that I’m willing to try things and find solutions or compromises, the conversation never seems to resolve.\n\nThe last few events that have me questioning things are as follows: For the past month, whenever either of us initiates sex, we end up stopping because he doesn’t want to wear a condom. He constantly says he “can’t feel anything” or that “it doesn’t feel the same/right.” It’s to the point where it almost looks like he shuts down when he puts it on. I can’t tell if it’s actually because it bothers him (I don’t know, maybe it’s sensory-wise) or if there’s something more going on. Anytime I try to have conversations about it, it’s always the same answer: “it doesn’t feel the same,” even when I suggested we try female condoms instead. \n\nTonight was no different. I said, “It feels like you’re purposely trying to make this difficult by repeatedly refusing to wear a condom (or any of my suggestions).” He didn’t respond, and after a few minutes, I asked, “Is that what you were hoping to achieve? Maybe even subconsciously?” He said, “No.” I then asked why he didn’t answer me initially, and he said he didn’t know what to say, which is his usual response during these types of conversations.\n\nIs it concerning that he doesn’t want to wear a condom or attempt any of my suggestions? I don’t want to assume the worst but it feels sorta manipulative… I don’t know, what to you guys think?\n\nP.S. I’m in therapy and will be discussing this with a professional at my next appointment.

However, I was friends with his sister back in highschool so we have technically known each other and I have known his family since I was a young teen. I only went over his house when I was younger though, so it's not like I've had a consistent relationship with any of them since then. \n\nSince my fiance's father died, his mother moved in with his sister and her husband for years and then when her sister divorced her husband and abandoned him and all of their kids for another man about 2 years ago, their mom moved in with my fiance's brother. Starting about two weeks ago, his mom and brother are not getting along so she moved in with us.\n\nI was perfectly happy about this at first. Im currently out of work and get lonely sometimes while my guy is at work so the company sounded quite nice, especially considering I thought his mom (73F) and I always seemed to get along so well when we would have them over for dinner. After a week of her moving in though, things between she and I have been spiraling...FAST! And I'm emotional AF about it! (But I'm also pmsing and have always suffered badly during this time emotionally and physically so I could be easily \"my own worst enemy\" at this time, as my SO likes to say.\n\nFor background context: My guy has always been her least favorite kid, according to him. She cherishes her oldest son who she pays for everything (rent, bills, groceries, Uber rides, etc.) for and has been doing so for many years while he chooses not to work. He couldn't take her anymore because he started using crack and was paranoid about her following him around all the time which is why he called his brother (my SO) to ask if she can stay with us. My SO is the only kid she would beat and abuse when they were younger, to the point that his dad took him under his wing and they bonded very strongly as his dad felt very bad about it but always loved his wife too much to leave her for it. After his dad died, she resented my SO even more as (in his mind, he looks just like his dad and reminds her of him?)\n\nAnyway, she had no interest in even inviting him (my so) to holidays until about the time he cleaned up his act (he was in and out of jail for a while but started going to church 3 years ago, got a great job, went from homeless, to riding a bike 40 minutes to and from work in all sorts of weather up until we started dating and he just got a car, apartment and now, as of last year we moved into our house) and suddenly asked to come over where we would frequently host her and his brother for dinner, cookouts and holidays. Before he got his act together, he never really heard from them not even to invite him to holiday dinners. Might be understandable to some, but she had zero issue with her two other kids while they were spiraling into drugs and other issues.\n\nNow, after her first few days of moving in were super great, it started one night when my SO and I got into a minor argument because when he came home from work, after he and I getting along amazing since his 2 hours of being home, he went out to the living room to talk with his mom and came back in our bedroom asking if something was w-rong with me \"today\" that day. It threw me off bc what would make him think I wasn't ok until he spoke to his mom? While he was at work I literally could not have been kinder to her, asking if she would like me to make her breakfast, lunch, chatting with her while also giving her space to get comfortable..anyway we didn't blow up on each other but she got insecure bc she heard is bicker and asked if she \"did anything w-rong?\" Which no, she did not, she just overheard him ask if I'm ok and I said \"why would I not be, we sat here getting along great since you have been home, why suddenly ask me if I've been alright today\".\n\nNo big deal. The next day, my SO was in the living room with his mom while I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette. I noticed our neighbors were having a party so I (admit, excitedly) went towards the living room saying \"the neighbors are having a party in case anyone wants to sit on the back deck enjoy the music and also, MIL, if it's a little loud tonight now you know why\" and I saw in the reflection of our dining room mirror, she looked at her son, threw her hands up and gave a nasty look as to say \"yea? Ok?And?\" And she looked mad as hell so I literally just sat outside by myself thinking wtf. My SO came out and we talked about that and even he said, \"so what you tried to be nice now if she can't sleep all night bc of the noise oh well\" and he suddenly got a text from his mom saying \"goodnight 😉\"...to my embarrassment I realized she was in her bedroom with the window open and had heard us talking about it on the back deck. And is it me or was that a weird ass text, they never say goodnight, I love you, nothing other than goodbye when they part ways.\n\nToday, she and I got along fine while my SO was at work. We even drove to his job together to drop off the lunch I made for him that he forgot to bring. He gets home, I go in my room, they are bickering about her other son in the living room, so I stay in my room to mind my business. She even said,\"what? You're gunna start arguing with ME now?\". When I thought the coast was clear for me to go in my own kitchen as I was hungry, wanted to grab a snack and they finally got quiet so I thought they were done arguing. Well as I walk in the dining room, she hears me coming and again, I can see her in the reflection roll her eyes and lets out a sarcastic \"haha\" sound. So when my SO and I were back in our bedroom and he heard the microwave go off for my snack he said oh ur food is done, I stupidly, sarcastically said \"well are you sure it's ok I go and get it?\" Which his mom heard me say and he got upset with me asking wth I was talking about and I said I'll tell you in a minute, go grab my food, as she hears me say I'll tell you in a minute she said \"oh God\" and when I went back to the room, shut the door, he was livid at me and demanded to know what I was talking about so I told him and he said \"she wasn't rolling her eyes at you, you always take things personally when it's not towards you\"....I admit, I sometimes do. \n\nWhich is why I am here....please, I am very self aware enough to know I sound like I am making a massive deal out of what could literally be MY own insecurity and have nothing to do with MIL. But if I'm stepping \"outside my mind\", my gut is telling me she and I are both being in a weird way insecure and idk...competing in some way while her son is home? Bc we are fine, zero tension when he is not here..Or is it just ME? Compared to most MIL stories I know this is nothing really at all...but I fear it is the START of at worst case scenario, the downfall of my relationship with my fiance.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

How can I move forward?\n\nBackstory: About three years ago my friend started dating this girl Ella, with her joining our friendgroup. They dated for about 2 years and during that time, Ella and I became pretty close. We had a lot in common and eventually we considered each other our \"best friend\". I want to make it clear that my feelings were very platonic during this time, and I respected her and my friend a lot. Despite this, my other friends would make jokes to me about how I am \"stealing\" her by hanging out with her so much, even though all parties involved had no issues. Their relationship was very rocky and I listened to Ella vent pretty often, until they eventually broke up in July. After this, things were mostly chill but at a certain point I realized I might have feelings. Due to her being my best friend, as well as my friends' jokes leaving a bad taste in my mouth, I pushed the crush aside. After all, I do genuinely value her immensely as a friend.\n\nFast forward to now, a few months later. Ella is currently hitting it off decently with this guy she met at work who is quite a bit older (he is 35). He came on very strong with very apparent (sometimes sexual) flirting and she is reciprocating albeit more innocently. She talks about him all the time and has the \"butterflies\" kind of crush. They have yet to hang out or do anything, its still only flirting.\n\nNow the matter at hand. I was talking to a friend and he told me he had a decent hunch that she had a thing for me. I thought it was funny and brought it up to her. She surprisingly responded saying, \"welllll maybe at some point or another I did, obviously I don't now\" (since shes talking to a guy at work). \"I feel like its normal for that to happen when a guy and girl become really close friends like that.\" When I heard this I got distracted and didn't think to mention that I had felt the same. However, later that day we hung out at my place and I brought it up when she was leaving.\n\nThe exchange was basically:\n\nMe: “just so you don’t feel like a COMPLETE loser, I also felt the same at some point” (I didn’t mention I still have a crush).\n\nHer: “Aww you’re saying you liked me too at some point?? Why didn’t you say something smh, we could’ve- kidding haha”\n\nMe: “Don’t worry though, we are on the same page. And I know you’re with [guy from work]”\n\nHer: “Well I’m not with him yeeeet” in a joking voice \n\nMe: “With how you guys are going you probably will be, don’t worry haha”\n\nIt did get me thinking though, IS there a path for me here? Was it even worth saying I felt the same about her? As much as I want to respect that she's talking/flirting with a guy from work, I realized this might be my last opportunity. Also, she still talks about this guy pretty often even after our exchange. I'm just really confused as this is still very recent, and want to be able to sort my thoughts. Advice is greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: my crush just admitted she liked me at some point, and i told her the same thing. wondering if theres a way forward for me despite her currently talking to someone from work", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I also didn’t have the option to leave because of the financial control he had over me. I can’t leave school in the middle of the semester to go back home to my parents either because I will owe all my FAFSA back. \n\nNow, even though I’ve broken up with him, we’re still living together. The lease, utilities, and internet are all in his name. I offered to take over the bills, but he brushed me off and made excuses about why I “didn’t need to worry about it.” \n\nThat keeps me dependent on him, even though I don’t want to be.

She had her coworkers and some friends there. I stopped by for a few but I couldn't get the weekend off because I had work.\n\n(There was a pool party last weekend too that I attended, since people at her job work around the clock, and everyone wanted to come to one, so I showed up to that one and worked the grill. Had a blast)\n\nAnyways, she ends up drinking too much, and starts making out with another girl, while sitting on her lap and telling her she's gonna take care of her children and wants a future with her.\n\nThe girl that she was sitting on, grinding on, and kissing on, her boyfriend shows up and he's pissed. He pours a drink on the girl my girlfriend is sitting on, makes a scene, and then leaves.\n\nI don't know this yet, and I get off of work and head straight there, texting her that I'm on the way and I will be there soon, and she says, \"Yayy\". \n\nI show up to the house, and something was off, because this coworker she was kissing on and flirting with while on her lap was being very, very nice to me. (Normally she doesn't even talk to me).\n\nI take them both in my truck to the waffle house to get them some food, they hold hands across the parking lot, and spend most of the time hanging on each other while I drove them around. They were giggling and giving off bad signs to me because I really try to be appropriate around social settings, but I hate when my girlfriend is a little flirty when she's drunk, especially touchy to other people. (She does this a lot).\n\nSo, I get them back to the house and we set down the food to eat at the kitchen table. This coworker of hers slaps my girlfriends butt and she giggles and says, \"yeah do you like that?\" \n\nI got pretty tired of it, and when I sat down, I put my hand on my girlfriends thigh for some physical comfort. She pushed my hand off and said, \"Don't!\", then continued eating. \n\nAnyways, I go home, I dont even want to spend the night and I decided to do some reconnaissance. I call and talk to the guy who poured a drink on the girl she was flirting with and kissing on. He told me everything he saw.\n\nI was freaking out, I had anxiety because I really really love her. A little bit about me is that I've always knew that if my relationship ended, with anyone, that I could be with someone again. With this girl, I dont want to be with anyone but her. So again, I was scared when it came to this information, and had a panic attack while at my house. The only person to comfort me is her, so I drove back over and got into bed with her. She was sleeping, reeked of alcohol and I just couldn't even look at her. So, in full panic attack mode, I got back in my truck, took two benadryl and slept for only 5 hrs. \n\nWhen I woke up my girlfriend was at work, and I gave her a call the MOMENT I woke up. I asked if everything was true and she said, \"I was just trying to think of a way to tell you.\"\n\nSo, yeah, she cheated on me. She's regretful, and very very apologetic, saying she is gonna quit alcohol, acknowledging abusive patterns towards me, all of it. But all I can do is look at her, and still get butterflies when she touches me. I can't imagine being with someone else, especially feeling the same type of deep connection I feel with her. How do I go about continuing my relationship with her and building that trust back?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

In the duration of the pregnancy announcement and us separating after a very intense and rocky relationship it’s understandable that she’ll be more on the emotional side of things which i completely understand.

I’m aware it’s early and that symptoms are different for every woman when things first start out, but she’s stated that she has morning sickness and feels tired, sleepy, weak, and overall not herself lately. I’d like to add that on top of her pregnancy she’s also anemic and most likely will be doing treatments/surgeries for her recently diagnosed skin cancer as well. I’ve offered countless times to help around with mundane things she’d normally do like clean up the house for her top to bottom, cook meals, care for her siblings, pets, maybe even take over her babysitting job temporarily so that she can simply rest and focus on just being energized for when she has strength to do things on her own, but she refuses. she tells me she’ll let me know or downright ignores the request and gives me a cold shoulder.

We have been together for 6 years, and coupled up just before COVID. We originally bonded over shared hobbies (board games, hiking, etc.) and spent much of COVID doing these things and getting closer. It has not all been good, and there have been ups and downs throughout the relationship. In the beginning, we were going through fights, broke up, and got back together. Around the 3-year mark, my partner's career really took off, and she put a ton of hours into work. I was very supportive and tried to take care of meals, and gave her space. I also work very hard and its been good thing for both of us at times. Though as a result, though, our adventure stopped, but I kept going on solo trips and traveling with friends. We did have a few nice vacations, but the periods between our special moments started to get longer and longer. Over time, it's been clear that we were both unhappy, intimacy slowed down, and fights increased in regularity. Things got really combative, and it seems like every fight she was trying to win, rather than trying to resolve the issues. This year, we started to go to couples therapy, and it helped some, but I think it helped more because there was a 3rd party mediator in the discussion. We've since stopped therapy after many sessions. Intimacy has all but ceased over the last 4 months, and I feel like I can't do anything right. We had a pretty big fight, and my partner suggested breaking up for the 3rd time this year. I convinced her to give it one more try, but over the past few weeks, it's clear that we are on our last limb. We are still bickering. I feel like I always say the wrong thing to trigger her. After I essentially broke down, we decided to go no contact for a few days, and I feel like a weight has been lifted and im much happier. I'm convinced that we are going to break up, and it does make me sad because I care about her.\n\nThe hard part of all of this is that she is great on paper. She is ambitious, funny, and beautiful.

I read a lot of these Reddit posts, and folks here have much bigger problems (infidelity, abuse, lying, controlling behaviors, jealousy), and we don't have any of that.

In contrast, I want to feel like a team during the tough times, and she can be a bit combative (that's how her family is)\n\nHas anybody felt this way?

He texted me again in July 2022 but I didn't reply until May 2025, and he replied to my text within 30 minutes asking, \"When and where can I see you?\"\n\nOur problem has always been that I'm soft, warm, and affectionate, and I fell in love with him fast and hard, and he's what I would call avoidant and a bit insecure. He admitted that in 2020, he resented how much I loved him, because he hated himself. We were never official so I knew he was involved with other women, specifically one woman, and he chose to date her because she was assertive, bossy, didn't think very highly of him, and he preferred that to my shy nature and tendency to smile at him with hearts in my eyes.\n\nSince reconnecting this year, he's seemed a lot warmer and more eager to open up to me. He says he doesn't want a relationship right now and sometimes feels like he is betraying his ex (the one who chose over me, who he broke up with in May 2024). When they broke up, she told him, \"Don't get back together with peonyprincessy.\"\n\nI asked him if he's told his friends I\"m back in his life. They're all aware of the love triangle drama. He said he did tell them, and that one of his friends asked, \"Well, what's she like?!\" and my situationship compared me to that friend's girlfriend, who is adored by the entire friend group for her sweet nature and kind heart. His friend lit up and said, \"Well I love my gf, she's my favorite person, so I'm sure I'll like peonyprincessy!\"\n\nThis was on the evening that he was waiting to see if he and his friends could come to my friend's rooftop party. My friend ultimately said no due to lack of space and lack of advance notice. My siutationship understood. Before my friend said no, my situationship told me he wouldn't be able to spend a lot of time with me and hoped we would attend the party as friends. \n\nHe's very hot and cold. One day he tells me he can't get enough of me in bed, and the next he asks if we can just be friends who cuddle but don't have sex because I'm \"too good to be objectified.\" Then a few weeks later, admitted he thought if would be easier if we stopped having sex so that it wouldn't feel disrespectful if he hit on women in front of me at parties. One day he's cuddling me and stroking my hair when I cry into his neck, and the next he's telling me about the other FWBs he has on rotation. One day the sex is intimate and there's lots of eye contact and he wants to stay in positions where he can see me, and the next he's saying we aren't sexually compatible (despite him coming quickly on accident).\n\nRecently he tickled me and blew raspberries on my belly. We cuddled on the couch and read his favorite manga together. He drove me to the train and panicked saying it was the last one, I had to go. Then he called me and said he was driving beside my train and I could actually get off at the next stop if I wanted him to pick me up to extend our time together. So I did.\n\nBut then recently he was visiting and I noticed a girl's name pop up on his texts. I saw her name pop up a few weeks prior, when he had chosen to spend an entire weekend with me, and he told her he was busy. Well, this time, I asked about her and he admitted he had been texting us both the night before asking us both if he could stay over. She eventually went to bed since he took too long to visit, so he came to me. I asked who he asked first, and he admitted he asked her first, only because the last several times he had sex were all with me and he wanted \"variety.\"\n\nThis hurt me deeply but I pretended it didn't. We made love the second he got to my place, and I put a pillow under his head when he passed out from all the drinking he'd done before arriving, and when we woke up, we cuddled and I kissed him all over and said I was so happy he was there. I bought pedialyte for him. We cuddled on the couch and watched a show.\n\nWe take pictures in photo booths together, kissing like we're a couple. But then he asks me not to post them anywhere (not like I would). A few weeks ago he said he still misses his ex but he hasn't brought her up to me in a while now. I can tell she's on his mind sometimes though.\n\nDoes this man love me and not even know it yet? Is he in denial?\n\nTL;DR: I've been in an on-again, off-again situationship with a man I’ve known since 2020. We briefly dated, then reconnected this year after his breakup with someone he chose over me. He says he doesn’t want a relationship, but we've become physically and emotionally close again. His behavior is inconsistent. He's affectionate one day, distant the next. He’s open about seeing other women but still seeks out time and intimacy with me. I'm feeling confused about his intentions and unsure if I’m misreading the situation or getting too emotionally invested in something casual.

I am understanding and I get it if people need space and I’m grateful that he tells me that before he goes silent, but I just want him to know that I’m there for him if he wants to talk to someone. Yesterday, we met and enjoyed the day together ( 9am to 12pm) , after that, he went to hang out with his friends for the rest of the day. Then he was still updating me with stuffs he’s doing but around the time they went to this place they hang out at, he suddenly stopped updating and just told me he lost his earphones. Then around 8pm he told me that he’s home and that “he’s not in the mood to talk”.. which made me reply with “ are you alright? please get some rest and drink water, i’ll be here” but he never responded after that.

We've had out ups and downs, and in the last few years his mental/physical health have steeply declined.  The doctors aren't really sure what is wrong with him physically.  Hasn't really responded to the hundreds (if not thousands) of pills the doctor prescribed, so no real improvement of his condition.  Only a steady decline.\n\nBecause of this and extensive workloads (he has a salary job that often works him 15hr days with low pay), it unfortunately results with us having less quality time then I'd like.  To clarify, he is also wfh (and I'm unemployed), so he's always in his office. This has caused many conversations with me feeling like my needs aren't getting met (ie quality time, snuggles on couch just chilling) with his response being that he's slammed at work/ really sick and is in \"survival mode\".  Which I get, he doesn't feel good.  If I was nauseous all the time then yeah quality time would be pretty low down the priority list.  But even knowing that, I'm human too.  I know its not his fault, but a girl wants what a girl wants.  \n\n\n\nAnyways, back to the point.  At some point during this conversations, it always devolves into \" I don't understand why you love me. Another guys could easily meet your needs\"  And I try my best to explain, but I personally struggle to verbally explain these types of things.  When emotions are high, my mind runs blank.  I don't do well on the spot.\n\n\n\nOne of the things I always mention is I love how excited he gets when going over a topic of interest.  He could be telling a story about Napoleon(he's a history buff), and he always has a humorous way of telling the story that makes it more engaging.  I love seeing how happy he gets when he's this way.  That or physics, different things occurring internationally.  Different topics of interest we share.  That's how we first met; at my kitchen table with him nerding out about astrophysics. This is usually my go to every time, and his response is everyone gets like that when they are excited about their topics of interest.  And no, everyone isn't.  He's special but I don't know how to describe it differently for him to get it.  So thus here is my post.

Some background.\n\nI am in a long term relationship, own a home together, 2 children (12 and 13) and have a really comfortable life. Our relationship has been amazing for as long as i can remember. We are still madly in love, my partner and me share the duties whilst both working, connected emotionally, physically and spiritually, but I'm feeling some guilt lately.\n\nI have never had a huge friend group which is totally ok with me, I've had friends in the past that have burned me, used me and hurt me mentally. I wear my heart on my sleeve and have in the past given far too much to be used in the process. Hubby has been very open and understanding about these situations and has given me great advice and speaks his mind if he sees me being hurt which i love and take on board but ultimately wants me to live and learn from mistakes which i have.\n\n  \nOnto my conundrum.\n\nI have started a new job in aged care a little over 12 months ago (IYKYK) and by far has been the most rewarding and toxic experience of my life. I have had so many rewarding highs but also has taken its toll mentally. My partner helps me and is my absolute rock, listening, giving advice and making our home my safe space. My partner is the ying to my yang as he is very easy going and doesnt take life too seriously whereas i have a very overactive and anxious mind\n\nI have met some great people at work but one imparticular that i call my best friend. He is (M50), we have very similar interests (horror movies, crystals etc.) and get along really well. this man has come from a super toxic long tern relationship which has shut him off from people completely. Over the year we have bonded in a way that i/we have helped this man in regaining some of his confidence, moving into his own place and basically started over. Him and the few work colleagues that know his situation have said i am his guardian angel and that no one has been able to help this man. He is the literal most sensitive person i have ever met, have heard this man cry more times than my children, and will get upset if he thinks he has said something to upset me even the slightest and is just genuinely broken.\n\n  \nNow onto my feelings of guilt.\n\nMy partner knows this man very well. He classes him as a close friend of his also. We have meals together, movies and other activities and will/has bent over backwards to help wherever he can. He knows we talk and text on the phone, catch up outside of work and knows that i will be safe. I have zero intimate or physical feelings for my best friend but have been finding myself deleting texts and feeling guilty when we speak on the phone for too long when my partner is home. I apologize for talking too long which i get a reply \"don't be silly its fine\" which i believe but am still feeling guilty for some reason. \n\nWith work i have suffered from some pretty bad burnout and although my home is my rock, i sometimes feel that i don't have the energy for too much conversation or physical attention but if bestie needs me i will jump to attention. If my and hubby are having a night out or weekend away, I feel that i need to lie to bestie about it incase it hurts his feelings, even though i have no feelings for him like i do my partner. It also feels kind of weird to kiss my partner when bestie is around as he's like a father figure to me (i lost my father at a young age).\n\n  \nI don't know why i am deleting texts or asking my partner for permission to talk but this is all new to me. I don't feel like i am pushing the line with what I'm saying but maybe i am and is why im feeling guilty?\n\nMy partner hasn't said anything to me about this but feel sometimes that he isn't feeling my energy or affection but maybe that is my guilt?\n\nI feel that if my partner was like my bestie i would feel extremely suffocated, but knowing his personality, i know that this isnt how he is.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

He’s the love of my life, my best friend, and I have no doubts that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. \n\nOk, I should say /almost/ no doubts. There’s a few alarms going off for me as we prepare to buy a house together later this year.\n\nLately, when we’ve been searching for potential houses, he’ll subtly try to rule out certain locations (even ones that are in affordable, safe cities with great communities) because he’s worried the places we’re looking at are “too far away from his parents.” While I’d understand this argument if we were looking, say, out of state, he’s raised this concern about places that are within 30-45 minutes of his parents’ house. Any time I’ve discussed a location beyond that threshold, he mentions that it’d be difficult logistically to move us /and/ his parents to that city. He states this as though it’s a given they’d have to move if we were more than an hour away. He’s also taking more and more of their advice regarding our future home, at times considering their suggestions more than my own. He’ll constantly tell me their ideas on furniture we “need” to get, how we should decorate the place, what color house we should look for, what style of house to buy, as well as what “necessary features” we need. \n\nThis is where I begin to feel like I might be paranoid. One of the “features” they’ve brought up multiple times is a guest room with a big closet for when they “pop in and visit” (as I said, we are talking about homes that are less than an hours drive away from them). My fiancé and I have discussed, albeit briefly and a while ago, that I would not be comfortable with extended family moving into our future home with us. We are wanting to eventually start our own family, and I very much want that experience to be between just the two of us and not with “granny and pops” living under the same roof. While his parents have never been manipulative or purposely intrusive (they’re incredibly kind people), they have very poor understandings of personal boundaries that have caused some issues in the past. I’m talking, entering-our-apartment-unannounced-using-our-spare-key-and-walking-into-our-closed-bedroom-during-spicy-time-because-they-were-already-in-the-area-and-wanted-to-see-us types of poor boundaries. While my fiancé has always had long and serious conversations with them regarding these incidents and why they’re unacceptable, I’m getting more and more worried that he’s not being fully honest with me about his and his parent’s future intentions, and that he’s hoping I’ll be fine with them eventually living with us.\n\nI’m prone to overthinking things, which makes me hesitant to confront him regarding this situation as it could all be in my head and I don’t want to make him feel like I hate his family (I don’t) or don’t trust him. It just feels like lately he’s been showing some concerning signs that he plans on his parents having more of a presence in his and my future as a married couple than he’s willing to own up to. \n\nHow do I bring up this conversation without making him feel like I’m accusing him or trying to start a fight over what could very easily a nonexistent problem? I’m terrible with confrontation after dealing with a long history of verbal abuse, but I know the longer I sit on this the more I’m going to spiral. \n\nTL;DR: how do I talk to my fiancé about my fear of his parents being made the priority over me in our relationship without making him feel like I’m attacking him for his close relationship with them?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

One day after another fight I decided to back a bag and go to my sisters because I couldn’t take another fight of gaslighting and nothing getting resolved then being blamed for “bringing things up before bed”. \n\nI left for a two weeks to give us both time to think. In that time I reflected and wrote down all the things I did wrong and took accountability. I wrote down what I would need to move forward. Meanwhile he took the time as a vacation.

At this point of time I already liked him, but since he was in a relationship I didn't make any moves and didn't say anything about how I felt about him, so I was just sitting on the feeling and burring it deep on the ground.\n\nBut things changed when he broke up, and he started to get more attentive, more talkative, he would call me everyday (he still does) at night to talk about our day, and just random stuff tbh. One day, my friends and I were at his place, my friends decided to leave to another house and he told them that we would follow them later, but then our friends cancelled the plans and he asked me if I just wanted to stay a bit and just watch a movie, so I said yeah. We sat on the couch and he hugged me and he kissed me, long story short we made out, and honestly I cried cause I already made out my mind that THAT wasn't gonna happen, and I told him that I liked him and he said that he liked me too, and that I was important to him, and that he loves me a lot...

We've been talking and hanging out with friends and stuff, but this last Saturday he asked me out alone, we went to have dinner and then we went to his house and we started watching a movie, and as you audience may suspect, yeah he tried to get physical with me, we kinda did, but I stopped him and he did stopped and apologized.\n\nBut at this moment of my life, I feel the shittiest of shittiest.

How to handle this?\n\nWe’ve been together 5 years and she is my whole world, we only ever talk to each other and share everything. Atleast that’s what I thought.\n\nOver the last few months, I’ve gotten really really busy with work so I couldn’t give her that much time during the day and there have been several fights between us where I also said some things to her which might have given her the idea that I don’t want a future with her. But then we would talk again and be happy again.\n\nI get that being unclear and busy with work is probably my fault, so I decided to give her another chance.\n\nWhile we were in the car I caught her chat with a guy. She claimed first that he is a friend, when I confronted and snatched her laptop she got defensive and blamed me at first, and then told she is talking to him since 4-6 months.\n\nI read their chats but tbh I was so shook that I couldn’t pay attention, and I quietly dropped her home without uttering a word and came back to my house crying like a kid.\n\nAfter which, she said she deleted all the chats, and blocked the guy (she showed me that she did). When I texted the guy from 2 numbers he also blocked me. He lives in the UK, she said she never met him IRL, nor called or video called and he was only a friend. But in person, the way she behaved when I confronted her is really opposite. So tbh I don’t know what to believe\n\nAlthough I’m 99% sure she did not meet this guy in person, but the thought that she may do this again is driving me crazy. I am not a crazy type guy and I run a startup and am the sole earner of my family, so I cannot afford to run behind her to check all the time.\n\nShe also does her job at my company only coz I want her to get in a better financial state so our entire lives are intertwined.

At the time, he had no job and would stay up every night gaming till I got back home. For awhile it was fine, I enjoyed having him to come back to. But then it got bad due to the fact I was spending all the money on groceries and necessities. I was ok with it though and brushed it off because I figured it was just situational. eventually, he had a fight with his mom and we moved into my parents house. I got him a job at my job which was now a smoothie store. Fast forward, still pretty broke, and I still bought the important stuff. I ended up having beef with the owners and quit. He quit too. So then I found a new job, and he was jobless. Eventually my parents got pissed. They required us to pay rent and said if he didn’t get a job he couldn’t live there anymore. They could see my pain. During all of this, he was addicted to weed and had CHS. Eventually I told him, for our relationship I needed him to quit. He was sick, and forgetful, and unmotivated. He did. It took awhile and I had to constantly remind him why he was doing it but he did it. Then he got a job. Still, constantly broke because he was spending all his money on gas and rent, I took care of us. Now, we are living in my parents basement and he has changed a lot for the better. But, I’ve realized, we haven’t been intimate in months. And when he tries my body shuts off and I get angry and grossed out. I think it’s due to the neglect. Not to mention he has emotional trauma so when I cry and express my feelings to him he shuts down and is extremely quiet. He is in therapy now, and has changed a lot. But I still don’t feel physically attracted to him. I miss having sex, and cuddling and feeling close.

Just generic titles. I hope you all understand.\n\nSo, recently my daughter's father has started acting like a complete lunatic. It started off with little insults here and there, hidden among our conversations about our daughter, which I tried to ignore, because I knew he had just lost the woman he loved (and also left me pregnant for, and abandoned his daughter for the first 3 years of her life for). But I get it. It sucks to lose someone you love. So I ignored it for as long as I could anyway.\n\nBut this last summer, was the absolute WORST. \n\nI lost half of my visitation time simply because he couldn't have been bothered to actually drop her off when he was supposed to. \n\nOur court ordered custody agreement stated that we have JOINT custody. Which means we are both allowed to have equal say in her education, her medical decisions, and her religion. it ALSO has a clause in there that I specifically requested that neither party shall disparage the other (because he has a nasty way of talking to me that is just beyond rude, and it makes co-parenting nearly impossible, which you will come to understand shortly).\n\nIt ALSO states that both parents should be allowed communication with the child with no restrictions (which he also violated when he refused to allow her to use the phone I bought her to call me).\n\nAnd it says that drop off times should be as follows: Her father shall have her during the weekdays while school is in session to ensure she is able to be close to the larger part of her family. (as at the TIME we viewed that as what would be best for HER, since I have no family here.) When school is OUT of session that schedule flips. Now the court specifies that she is to be dropped off no later than 6pm on Friday night at my house during the summer. But nearly EVERY week, I would find myself waiting until Wednesday at the wee hours of the night, before I would be able to see my daughter's  beautiful, smiling little face!\n\nSo after nearly an entire summer of his shenanigans, I had, had enough! I was beyond pissed off. So the next time he was late, I decided to call the local sheriff on him for contempt of court. Keep in mind, he was nearly 2.5 hours late (he only lives 30 minutes away on a BAD day), and when the sheriff called him, he admitted he hadn't even started getting her ready, and they were still at the house just watching movies, which means he had absolutely zero intention of dropping her off when he was supposed to, and not likely it would have even been that day. (the sheriff told me he would make a note of it on his report that it was obvious he had no intention of dropping her off).\n\nKeep in mind, the sheriff didn't even go to his house. all he did was give him a CALL. now the day I made the call, went without a hitch once the sheriff lit a fire under his ass. (but it was probably because he didn't know if the sheriff was in hiding and watching what he was doing) but the NEXT week, all HELL broke loose! He showed up at my house, pounding on my door like some crazed lunatic, screaming obscenities at me, making horrible threats, and demanding I let him into my apartment. Obviously I refused. I'm not going to let someone behaving that way into my only safe space. The worst part about all of it tough, was he had our daughter with him during all of this. She saw and heard everything he said to me that day. and man... it did a number on her. My heart breaks that she had to see and hear that nastiness. She told me he pushed her out of the way when she tried to stop him, and nearly knocked her down the stairs.\n\nWhen she (my daughter) was finally able to make it inside my apartment, she told me that he punished her after I had to call the cops on her as though SHE was somehow responsible. I just gave her a big hug, and told her it wasn't her fault, and that I am sorry that her father did that to her. (if I had known he was going to take it out on HER, I probably would have thought twice about calling the cops, but I can't help but feel his doing that is some attempt at ensuring that I don't call the cops again. his way of intimidating me by taking it out on her every time I have to do something like that.\n\nMy choice to call the cops was not made lightly. I want to make that very clear. I endured this behavior from him almost the entire summer before I lost my patience with it all. I kept making excuses for him, that he was suffering the loss of his girlfriend, and that eventually he would go back to normal, but sadly... it's only been getting worse.\n\nnow last week he tried to have me removed from her school approved visitors list so I wouldn't  be able to appear there after the teacher requested a meeting with the 2 of us. \n\nAfter I informed the teacher that I would be attending, my phone blew up with texts from her father about how he isn't going to allow me to attend, and that he was going to have me removed from the visitor's list, because my disabilities are an embarrassment to him. How he doesn't want to be seen in public with me, and how the very idea of it gives him anxiety. (real nice huh? not like i can help being disabled, and I was disabled when he met me. Not like anything changed that much since he chose to make our daughter with me) but I digress...\n\nThen this weekend he dares to drop her off in nothing but a short tee shirt, and TIGHTS (not stretch pants, but actual tights you are supposed to wear under a DRESS!) with a HUGE gaping hole in the crotch and her underwear just hanging out of them! When I \"dared\" to bring up how inappropriate it was for him to drop her off in such clothing, he started berating me for things he perceived as \"bad parenting\" but was actually just me preparing her for what is going to be happening to her body soon, as her family is KNOWN for early onset puberty. (her aunt got her first menstrual cycle at 9 years old, and I went through it at 10 if you can imagine, and since my daughter is currently 8, I wanted her to be properly prepared for it and not blind sighted like I was) but apparently that is me being \"f\\*\\*ked in the head\" according to him. I honestly don't see how I did anything wrong in preparing her for a potential early transition into womanhood. I think what I did isn't nearly as bad as what he did. He took her out in PUBLIC like that! It had to have been awfully embarrassing for her. :(\n\nAnyway, I am just looking for some advice on how I should handle all this. it has had me so overwhelmed lately, and I need to find some kind of solution that won't hurt my daughter. (or at least minimize the hurt as much as humanly possible) I understand a situation like this isn't likely to be solved without some kind of sacrifice/compromise (if it's even possible to compromise with him at this point... I dunno) \n\nBut I'm hoping that someone out there might have gone through something similar, and found a way to make it all work some how, that maybe might be able to give me some advice on how to deal with all of this insanity. \n\nI thank anyone who may comment in advance for taking the time out of their day to respond. I will do my best to answer any questions you may have, if there is anything that I may have not made clear enough, or maybe been too vague about. I was trying to tell the story as quickly as possible, but it IS kind of a long one. and for that I apologize. \n\nTLDR: my daughter's father has been consistently violating our court ordered custody agreement in an attempt to keep my daughter from me, saying nasty things about me in front of her, and even going as far as causing a huge scene at my house in front of our daughter., and dressing her in clothes that has her underwear showing in public.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I really have a hard time getting out because of my own issues so I try to see her sometimes but not as much as she asks me to.\n\nOne it clicked she was really pushy is when she insisted in going on a girly vacation in august, even though I told her Im moving out soon so I have to save as much money as I can (and I dont really have that much money because I am in college, too) but she started insisting and insisting and i just gave in and went with her.\n\nThe problem starts here, after our vacation we saw eachother only once, but she was eager to go together to a house my grandparents own outside of the city for some days before the classes, wich start next week (oct 5th) the problem was I had to go with my parents out for some days, but there was a weird situation on the airport and we came home some days later than expected, and not only that but I also got sick.\n\nSo tomorrow was the day she wanted to go on that trip but I have been sick all weekend and not able to answer the phone so I supposed we were just not going because it was never confirmed, it was just an idea and since we couldn't plan it and I couldn't ask my grandparents I assumed it wasn't happening.\n\n Since I had a headache, I had my phone silenced and didn't see my notfications, but my mom told me she had texted her twice yesterday and now she was texting her again to see where I am, then my sister came and said she was texting her too ????? I decided to unlock my phone and I had **14 missed calls** and a load of texts inbetween different social media, so I got so anxious and weirded out, the thing is she did something similar to this, even texting my mom in another ocassion and I disregarded it because I had not answered her for unrelated reasons. \n\nBut the numbers of calls and texts, the fact she texted my mom and my sister and the fact that this is not the only time she does this has me feeling uneasy.\n\nI guess I don't know how to proceed with this situation or if it's even normal\n\nAlso sorry for my bad english and for the text wall", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

My friend recently got married, and included me in the wedding party. She mentioned how her fiancé had an older half-brother. I asked to see a picture, and he was cute. We brought the joke to her fiancé a couple of times, but he downplayed it and said I wouldn’t be his “brother type,” which he had no right to say when he tried to pair me up with a guy whose type is blondes, and I’m not one until I feel like being one, if you know what I mean (wigs). So casually, I started downplaying my interest, but when my friend was planning the wedding, she told me, “You and him are going to walk together.” Months go by, and the wedding is here. \n\nFor the rehearsal, we met at her church to practice. I noticed he was looking at me here and there, but didn't get a chance to talk to me until we were practicing our walk. He would try to initiate conversation by asking me how I was doing and joking about how he hoped the aisle wouldn't be so tight at the venue.\n\nAt the wedding \n\nFast forward. Before the wedding, which was held outside, these were the top moments. \n\nOne particular moment, we, the bridesmaids, were in the process of taking pictures with the bride. Once we finished, we stood around outside while the groomsmen were in the venue with the groom. I heard noise, it was his son trying to go outside, so he came to get him. At the moment I looked from his kid to him, and he looked up at me at the same time, I quickly turned my head because I was blushing. Soon, then, he told his son, “You’ll have to stand here and look at the pretty ladies taking pictures”, I mean, coincidence, maybe?\n\nAnother moment happened right after, my plus one (another best friend of mine) noticed, he was standing near the door when we walked in, then he saw it was me, and continued to stare until he turned away to continue talking with his family members.\n\nDuring the recession, he asked me how I was doing while we walked up the aisle. I told him my feet were killing me, and he said he was related because his knees were hurting as well, and we both laughed at that. It felt very nice. My plus one joked that we looked cozy, and he was attentive, and held on to each other until we got inside. Of course, he was a gentleman, and he let me go first. When we got inside, it looked like he wanted to finish the conversation, but couldn't because it was time for the bridal party to be around the bride and groom, and soon after, we all had to take pictures.\n\nOnce we were done taking pictures, I went to sit with my friends for the reception inside the barn. I was tired. My feet still hurt because of the heels. I noticed he came over to get himself a drink, so I decided to confidently ask him, “Can you give me a bottle of water?” He nicely accepted the request, but he was looking high and low for that water and couldn't find it in the cooler. Until another person opened another cooler, and the water was in there. Since it was closer to me, I said, “Oh, never mind, I can get the water, it's right here.” I tried to reach for it from my chair, but he said, “No, I got you”, and he proceeded to get me the bottle of water. \n\nAt a big moment at the reception, I was talking with one of my friends, and all of a sudden, I felt a pair of eyes on me, which caused me to turn, and he was looking at me, then quickly, he turned his head.\n\nThere was a moment when he was really being a dad, which was good because he was looking for his child. Usually, the kid would be with relatives. In my opinion, I don’t mind him having a kid; I know many people my age are starting families. However, the only downside is that my family is against it. As for his family, I’m not entirely sure; I’ve heard from the bride that his mother is somewhat shipping. She even mentioned me to him before, but she downplayed it when she was caught. There are times when she butters me up. There’s a lot to consider, but I want to know if he's interested. He's truly my type to T. I don’t want to initiate, I believe he wants to he would, but I understand why he can’t because he might feel I’m not interested, but i am. I need some more opinions first. Oh, and he doesn't live in the same state; I live in Georgia, and he lives in Utah.\n\n.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

It was two weeks long and we quickly became friends.

On September 1st we finished the program, and during the ending ceremony, he half jokingly said that he doesn’t know if we’ll keep in touch because we live far away, we’re from a small country, and we live two hours apart, he lives in the south and i’m at border between center and north. \n\nI was worried that i’ll be filled with regret if I won’t do anything about my crush, and bcs he said that he doesn’t know if we’ll stay friends I figured that I don’t have anything to lose and messaged him asking if he wants to go out sometime, he replied saying that it’s a good idea and if I was free the following week. We agreed to meet up in a central city that is the same distance from both of us. His replies sounded a bit friendly to me and I was worried that he doesn’t think it’s a date so I didn’t bring it up. \n\nWe met at a mall at 12:30 pm, and I helped him shop a bit, then we went to a thrift store, and then we went to eat. We said goodbye at 8:00 pm. We barely talked about the program and we had amazing conversations, talking the entire time. We touched each other a few times, but nothing that can’t be friendly. We sat down at a restaurant which used to be me and my ex’s spot, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it and mentioned it to him. We got to talking about past relationships, and he said that he doesn’t know if he’s over his ex (they broke up in October but were together for almost three years), and that he doesn’t know what he’s looking for right now. It was pretty obvious at the point that it’s not a date. \nI was pretty bummed, bcs he’s a total gentleman, he kept offering to hold my bag, he offered his seat to me on the subway, and complimented me when I tried on clothes.

She what will not respond to even simple texts like when I update her that I am on my way home, unless it's \"okay\" only.\n\nWe have been married just shy of 1 year, together for about 7 years.\n\nFor the days leading up to this, she has been excessively clingy and wants me to plan every part of her day.  I don't say this to disperse, but she expects me to plan every meal, and if I am a little bit later than a predetermined time limit that she didn't tell me then she will either go out and get food, or refuse to eat entirely.  She also is begging me to hang out with her, but I already spend basically every moment of the day with her (we work in the same building, but have different employers).  I am generally okay with this, but just being near her isn't enough.  I tried to play a video game with her the other day, but she seemed distressed and was taking it out on me. Bumping into her character in-game and knocking her off a ledge caused her to stop responding to me and was silent for about 15 minutes.\n\nWhen I ask her what is wrong she will only say \"I'm fine.\", and when I press and say \"you have been acting different for a while, I'm worried.\" She will figure to act like I'm crazy for bringing it up. \n\nWe had plans to go do an activity at the end of the weekend, and she became upset that I was on my phone just before it and went to bed early on the afternoon.  I asked her if she still wanted to go, and she refused, so I went anyway since I desperately needed something to distract me after a hard weekend of being given the cold shoulder while also being accused of not \"hanging out\".

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 8 months. At the start of the relationship I made it clear that physical affection is my love language, now let me tell you our current situation:\n\n1. We never make out. The last time we made out for more than 5 minutes was 2-3 months in the relationship, she said at the time that she didn't want it to transition to intimate thing so I reassured her, she made an effort for a few weeks but now if we make out for more than 30 seconds she tells that she wants to do something else. When confronted she tells me that it makes her sleepy to lie down. So yeah basically Pokemon is more enjoyable than making out with me, as you can imagine I feel great about that.\n\n2. Rules are being broken and changed. Early in the relationship she told me that when we are over at her place she doesn't want me to satisfy myself if she is tired or unwilling cause then she feels likes she can't satisfy me. Last week she admitted to masturbating in the bathroom cause she had an urge and didn't have the energy to be satisfied by me. Yesterday she told me that if we really have an urge we should let each other do it if the other person isn't available (I have made it clear that no matter what I am always willing to do her and always have) so basically it's if she's tired and can't do me or she's tired and can't do herself with me. (She likes rubbing herself on me while I finger her and it takes a lot of energy)\n\n3. Things said early are not being respected. Her ex used to use her to get himself off and not satisfy her, she made it clear that she hates that and would never do that. 2/3 times after doing her she will fall asleep telling me that she will do me later, I don't know about you guys but I don't stay in the mood for that long and it isn't exactly a switch I can pool. When I told her about what she had told she said that she has a lower sex drive and that I can sacrifice my part sometimes since she can't have hers as often. \n\n4. No sex. 8 months without sex, she is not a virgin, she is not fresh off a toxic relationship or anything, she has had sex with every ex and earlier, at 5 months she dropped the news that she wants to wait to have sex with me. Let's look at her excuses:\n\"It creates irritations\" so the routine with every other ex didn't?\n\"It takes a lot of time and I want to enjoy my weekend\" she sleeps on average 32 hours ok weekdays cause she has to wake up at 7:00 (8:00 if online) and plays videogames from 21:00-1:00+ cause she needs them for her mental health (I play with her but now with my work too I won't stay as late now).\n\"I enjoy other stuff more\" thanks for telling that would have meant never sex in the very start (never said anything).\n\"You said that sex means love and closeness to you so it changed my perspective\" doesn't that contradict each one of the previous points?\nI am not gonna force her to do it, I would never, but I want that physical closeness with my partner and yes sex is important for me which I made clear at the start.\n\n5. Things changed from the start. She always gets offended when I say this cause she says that her exes said it too. In the first few months she used to pull me into her room to make out, ask me to do her cause making out turned her on and saying she wanted me before getting on top of me before rubbing herself on me. Now she doesn't wanna make out and never makes me feel like she is turned on cause of me, just urged.\n\nWhen I bring all this up to her, if she doesn't wanna accept it I'll try to get her best friend in on it too since they 100% agree with me.

We've been married fo3 just a little over 2 years now. My siblings live with us and pay rent, which helps cover about half of the mortgage and utilities.

I’ve already helped him financially multiple times, including paying off his credit card debt before we got the house.\nI’m not strict or controlling about money. I don’t ask to manage his income or tell him what to do. I only ask that he takes care of his share of the house expenses. I’ve been covering groceries and most daily needs on my own. But even with that setup, he’s still unable to manage his money well, and now I’ve noticed he’s accumulating credit card debt again.\n\nWhat worries me is that he’s aware of his financial limitations, but still continues to make unnecessary purchases. For example, just today, I transferred money to his account to make sure his automatic payments don’t bounce, but he spent part of it right away for a motor ride.\n\nI’ve tried bringing this up calmly and respectfully, but it often turns into me feeling like I’m being too hard on him.

And please don’t misread what I’m saying, I am not shaming him at all. He isn’t waiting for marriage or anything, to my understanding he just hasn’t really had any relationship experience before. I was just surprised to learn this and I’m just wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experiences similar to this. \n\nTLDR; I (23f) have recently started seeing a guy (23m) who is still a virgin. I have quite a bit of experience sexually and I’m feeling some internal shame about our polar opposite experiences and I’m feeling pressure about being his first sexual partner", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I Think It May Be Unreasonable.\n\nMy boyfriend’s sister asked us a few days ago if we wanted to go to a theme park with her for a Halloween event. I’ve never met his sister in person before and have only talked to her through message once so this would be my first time meeting her. My boyfriend also hasn’t seen her in person for quite a few years. \n\nThe theme park she asked us to go to is about 2 hours from my boyfriend and I. I told her that it sounded like a good time! She then followed up with that message letting me know she doesn’t have a car so she’ll need a ride there. The thing is, she lives 1 hour and 30 minutes past the theme park. So we’d be driving around 3 hr. 30 min. to go pick her up, drive 1+ hr back in the opposite direction, another 1+ hr to take her back home afterwards, and then another 3 hr. 30 min. to drive back home. The event also starts at 7pm which is a very long night because of the distance. \n\nShe then mentioned we could stay the night with her. I don’t know if I feel exactly comfortable doing this since I don’t know her well at all and I also have a sick cat with chronic kidney issues and IBD who needs medication daily, as well as a few month old kitten so we would need to hire a pet sitter and that adds a lot more to our plate. \n\nI brought up my concerns with my boyfriend and he insisted that he’d drive the whole way but I still didn’t feel so sure about the idea. He guilt tripped me a bit telling me he hasn’t seen his sister in years. I told him I never said we couldn’t go see his sister (he wouldn’t go unless I did by the way), I just hope there can be more of a compromise, like maybe we make the drive but she pays for his ticket since she invited us. Or she pays us gas money.. He told me she doesn’t really have the budget for it and “we just won’t go then.” Well we don’t really have the budget either?? If she can’t afford to chip in some then I’m not sure why we can’t at least do something cheaper and closer to where she lives?\n\nI want him to see his sister and I don’t want to be the reason he doesn’t, but I also feel like the all of the responsibility is on us and she’s been a little bit pushy for an answer. When she mentioned the car issue, I hadn’t responded for several hours (it was my boyfriend’s birthday at the time so it was a very busy day, and I had a lot to do to prepare for his celebration) and so she ended up messaging my boyfriend asking for me to answer her. I was a little annoyed because the initial message she sent me was last Monday in which she asked if I liked theme parks. I responded 3 hours later and told her that I did. She didn’t respond until his birthday which was 5 days later and that’s when she asked us if we wanted to go to the theme park with her. \n\nMy boyfriend came home from work today letting me know his sister wants to call us to talk about the plan since we haven’t given an answer yet. My boyfriend is a people pleaser, so I know he’ll just say yes, but I don’t know if it’s reasonable for me to ask for a compromise. I feel guilty because it makes me feel like I’m the one standing in the way, but at the same time, it seems unfair for the whole burden to be on us when we were the ones invited and it’s not the best first impression on her end either.\n\nWhat do you think is the reasonable thing to do? \n\n**EDIT:** The comments I’ve received have opened my eyes to a different perspective. I want to add that when my boyfriend’s sister asked me last Friday (his birthday) if we wanted to go to this Halloween event with her, she emphasized that she wanted me to keep it a secret from my him. When I hadn’t responded within a few hours that day, she texted my boyfriend asking for me to respond, and then ended up telling him what the plan was.. It almost seems as if she wanted to play it off as a “birthday surprise” for my boyfriend but got impatient because it’s something that she’s desperate to attend and needs a ride.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

(I put kind in quotes because I don’t really think Im even that kind, Im just a very loving person and will do everything for people I care about) \n\nIm gonna put a description off all 4 and why I feel used/how it ended. I guess I would like to know if I should stop giving women the world.\n\nGirl 1: (19 M 20 F  Relationship: 5 months) Called me one night and said I treated her better than any guy. Said I was the first guy to never be abusive or cheat on her. Said she loved all the trips and dates I planned out for us. Then proceed to say she didn’t deserve me and blocked me on everything. She had told me about a month into us talking that she had actually got out of a relationship like a week before we started talking, so I feel I was just used as a rebound. \n\nGirl 2: (19M 19 F  Talking Stage: 1.5 months) This one hurt the most because we got very close very quick. I did so much for this girl in a short span. Heres a few of many examples… She got stranded alone because her sister who she was with got arrested and her car got impounded, so I drove 5 hours at 4am to go get her (this was within the first 5 days we met.) I bought her tickets to her favorite soccer team because she had never been to a sporting event. She had 2 daughters and whenever I came over I loved the hell out of those kids (her daughter made me realize I might be a girl dad lol.) But one day she posts on IG and I see a mans hand on her in the photo. I reply “damn… really?” and she says “ 😂 if you cared so much you shoulda made me ur girlfriend” and blocks me. I was gonna ask her to be my girlfriend the next time I came over to see her 💀. \n\nGirl 3: (18M 20 F  Relationship: 3 months) I helped her get out of a very dark time in her life. She was doing a lot of pills and was generally not very happy with her life. I was always there for her, would stay on the phone with her every night, etc…  When she started getting better she slowly grew distant and would always have an excuse as to why I couldn’t come see her.\n\nGirl 4: (18M 18F  Relationship: 6 Months) She didn’t have much going for her. No car, no job, not much food at home. I would always give her rides, get her food whenever we hung out, took her many places she had never been or thought she would go. Eventually when she did get a job she pulled the same thing as Girl #1 saying she didn’t deserve me, except she didn’t block me just went ghost. \n\n\nEdit: I would like to include the fact that some of these girls did things for me too. Yes I probably did more In all of them and I see I need to slow down but heres a couple things they did. \n\nGirl 1: Would often buy me a drink from starbucks or dutch bros and bring me it on my lunch break at work.

I’ve been through domestic abuse so my fight or flight really kicks in at these moments and if I don’t walk away, I will end up screaming, saying things I don’t mean and just exploding into anger (I know,￼ I’m working on it..) \n\n\nThe problem is my partner is the type of person who wants to talk about things and work through things immediately. And for this reason, anytime I walk away, he follows me into the room that I have gone in and blocks the doorway.  This is very triggering for me because of my past.. and usually escalates the argument even more. It has gotten to the point to where I will try to go around him or move him out of my way, but he is larger and stronger than me and continues to keep me from exiting. \n\nThis leads to explosive arguments. \n\nI have tried reasoning with him and explaining to him where my head is at, and what my needs are￼ as far as needing to be able to step away first. He says that he will not put his need (to work through things immediately,) on the back burner and he shouldn’t have to compromise. He also believes that in those heated moments, I should politely let him know that I still love him, but I need space but I find this very challenging as my anger escalates quickly, especially now that I’m pregnant. Has anyone experienced something similar to this? Can anyone give advice?\n\n\nEdit to add this: I don’t mean to paint myself as the victim so I want to be more transparent about what happens in these moments, I rise to anger very quickly, which will sometimes involve me yelling and then I choose to walk away to catch my breath.

Of course I agreed and we both mutually understood that this was going to become a relationship. However, everytime my phone gets a notification, he is always the first one to check it and see who sent me a message. So to ease his mind, we went through my phone and I showed him that there is nothing to worry about because I’m not talking to other men.\n\nHowever, it did make me curious. It almost felt like he was projecting and maybe he’s the one that’s being disloyal. So whilst we were on his Instagram, just looking at random videos. He swiped off and I saw that he was messaging this girl. \n\nThe messages were very friendly, however it felt like they were speaking as if they were in the beginning of a talking stage.

This is my first post in this community, and I’m hoping you guys will be able to help me and my bf out!\n\nMe and my boyfriend are currently long distance because I’m on a leave of absence from college until the spring. We’re able to see each other every once in a while, but not often and not consistently. When we’re together physically, we’re fine! We might disagree occasionally but overall the relationship is very solid and satisfying for the both of us.\n\nHowever, as soon as we’re apart again, we’re worse. It’s like an immediate vibe switch. We disagree and argue more, and most of our (short) phone calls are long, unhappy discussions about how we’re unsatisfied with long distance.\n\nOne major problem my boyfriend has is that we argue a lot more, and he isn’t happy with how often we have conflict. I understand, so I pitched we start reading Fight Right together because it came highly recommended. I recently started reading, and he said he’s going to start reading relatively soon. I also tend to be a complainer and it’s wearing on him.\n\nA problem I have is that I feel like I put more effort into our long distance relationship than he does. I’m the one pitching virtual date ideas, asking to call, initiating most text conversations, trying to problem solve conflicts we have, etc. This has taken a toll on me because I feel like I’m putting in a lot more time and energy, and getting very little back. He recently has been texting more often and initiating conversation, which I appreciate and have let him know, but he is really reluctant to do any kind of virtual date besides occasionally watching movies. He says that it’s because long distance is boring and unfulfilling to him, and he has no motivation to put in any effort. He wants to stay with me because he loves me (and because we’ll stop being long distance in January) but long distance feels like a cheap imitation of being together in person.\n\nThis post is obviously biased because my boyfriend isn’t here to give his feedback, but yeah! Any advice would be helpful. How do you minimize arguing in a LDR? Any books you recommend? How can I start being more positive when we call? And what about my problems with putting in more effort?

I don’t like to get super drunk so don’t like it in others lol. He then got annoyed saying he never asks me to talk slower because I never did cuz I don’t care and so because of that “a lot of the time” he doesn’t know what I’m saying. He’s very respectful and still was then but I knew it wasn’t true because we talk fine?? After we woke I told him I didn’t know that actually was a problem, and of course he confirmed that it wasn’t but was in the past. But it’s like he expects me to know way more Italian, he’s improved seemingly more than me because he already knew so much and just been perfecting it daily. And I’m also the one that pursued him in the way that he told me he figured I wouldn’t want a relationship like that (long distance) so he was just gonna let go of the thought of me that way even though he felt what I did. The same as in I’ve never met someone before that just made me so happy being around them like I did. And I would not want a long distance relationship, but he’s just special lol. I didn’t know his age when we met, I guess I assumed at least 21 because I wasn’t thinking about how 18 is the drinking age\n\nBut as of lately I’m just randomly paranoid that he will hook up with a girl because I know it sounds stupid, but because he is attractive and guess I’m making stereotypes because of his age, that younger guys just want that. He also said in the past that he can’t wait until I’m so fluent so we can do it in his language and it feel just as natural for me or whatever. So that also is feeding my paranoia because “why wouldn’t he want someone who speaks his native language”? I guess you would say I’m the dominant one, so it just seems pathetic for me to be like I think you’re doing something wrong even though there’s no reason. Especially when I have soo much that confirms the opposite. In the beginning of August when I was there he introduce me to a good friend that was traveling when we got together so I never met him and my bf kinda got embarrassed but in a cute way about  the dude saying that I’m all he talks about. \n\nHas anyone been in something similar??, I’ve been in 3 relationships, longest being 1 year. I was always the one who definitely liked them more but I don’t feel that now so I’m thinking that’s what’s scaring me.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We just started long distance as we are going to different colleges (6hrs apart). So far things have been going absolutely amazing, it sucks, but I feel like we are the most in love we’ve ever been because we are actively taking steps towards our future. However, this all changed last night. We had had a “hangout” planned for like a week for last night, we had been talking all day and we were so excited—overall morale was just high. But once we started FaceTiming, it just wasn’t going well. There was tons of silence and just like awkwardness (partially my fault because I was tired and just kind of not engaged), and eventually she asked if I had been feeling disconnected in the relationship. I said yes, and that I just felt like that was a natural part of long distance—sometimes we will feel super connected and sometimes we won’t—we are dating through a phone screen after all. After I responded with this she just started talking about how she had been thinking about long distance and how it just doesn’t work for her brain and that she doesn’t think she can do long distance for 4 years if she’s already disconnected, and she said this disconnect made her feel as if she “didn’t need me”. This took me by complete surprise, because I felt like everything was going amazing, and she was fronting to me like she felt the same. She said that she had been thinking this essentially since we got to college (a month ago). I asked if she was breaking up with me and she said “I don’t know”. This hurt me deeply because it felt like she had been thinking about this for a long time and just didn’t say anything, then came to me already having came to the conclusion that we should maybe break up. I feel so confused and hurt that she would throw away what we had just based on feeling disconnected because of the distance—and she didn’t even try to fix it before coming to this conclusion. She explained that it was nothing I was doing wrong and that she didn’t think it worked for her, which felt like she was telling me my best wasn’t good enough. We have had issues in the past of her not letting me in on her thoughts, and her not allowing me to be on her team, but I thought we resolved that. But last night proved to me that we didn’t resolve it, and that really broke my trust in her emotionally. We are both Christians, and so I asked if she had been praying about this and what she got out of that. She responded that she had and that she got out of it that “we should probably break up”. Which absolutely shattered me. At this point I thought we were done, but she kept insisting that after our conversation she thinks we can make this work because her feelings were validated by me and she feels like it was normal to feel. It was normal for her to feel disconnect and doubt, but the way she went about dealing with that made me feel so hurt and so disrespected. Ultimately, I want to be with her with everything in me, but my brain told me that I didn’t deserve to keep dealing with emotional whiplash. I decided that she is worth giving another chance, but I’m scared and I need advice on how we can overcome this.\nAlso, important context is that she reiterated many times that the distance was the only thing making her feel disconnected, and that she truly believed if we were together in person everything would be perfect. I visited her 2 weeks ago and she said that during that time she felt like our relationship was perfect.\n\nTL;DR my long distance girlfriend broke my emotional trust by lying to me and not letting me in on her mental processes and deciding that we might need to break up. I decided to give her another chance but I’m scared that I’m going to keep getting strung along, and I need advice on how to go forward and how we can make this work.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

She lives outside the EU, I live in the EU. We’ve only met once for a week, but we talk and text every day. I love her very much and can see a future with her, including marriage.\n\nShe says we should marry now just to have the document, since in her country it can take up to a year after the wedding to even get a visa appointment. Her idea is: we marry now, and once I have a stable job and a place to live, we apply for the visa and truly start our life together.\n\nBut despite this, I don’t feel good about it. I just recently finished my training/education and haven’t found a job yet. I don’t feel prepared to go into a marriage “empty-handed,” without employment or income. I told her that I want to first find a stable job and get through the 6-month probation period, so I can enter the marriage with more self-confidence. She says that once she comes to my country she also wants to work, but I still feel a lot of pressure, and for me it all feels too fast.\n\nThe problem is, I’ve already agreed to marriage multiple times to avoid conflict and because I was afraid of losing her. Each time I thought: “I’ll manage it somehow.” But whenever it got serious, I realized deep down that I wasn’t ready.\n\nNow my girlfriend has lost patience because the wedding has been postponed multiple times. She even says now that it’s already “too late” and that we should have married long ago. This makes me feel even more pressured, and instead of looking forward to marriage, I feel stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nSo I’m torn: On one hand, I love her and don’t want to lose her. On the other hand, I know I’m not ready, and marrying without a stable foundation would give me a very bad feeling.\n\nHow would you see this?

I think we have built a great relationship. We are trusting, communicate great and both see a real future with each other. The biggest issue we’ve had is distance and making time to see each other. He is in a rigorous residency program where he is working 80+ hours a week and even when he comes home for the day, continues to work until he only gets 5 hours of sleep. So 19 hours of his day are committed to his job. He still makes it a priority to text and call me and lets me know when he’ll be busy and can’t talk. I just have a normal job at the moment and I don’t work Fridays, so I am available to come see him on weekends. I understand not going to see him when he has to work that weekend, but even on the weekends he doesn’t work, I’m not able to go. We have talked in depth about this and he says he wants to have quality time together, he doesn’t want to be stressed about working and me being there at the same time. He’s worried I will feel like I’m being used just for physical things then he gets back to work. On his weekends he does typically work all day Saturday/Sunday even if he isn’t actually going into work. I am about 10 hours away, his family only about 2. So he has seen his family a few times. And I have asked him, why can you make time for them but not for me? (But worried less weird than that) and he says he has a family event for an hour or two then gets back to work at their house. I have told him many times how I don’t care about him working , that I’ll come and just get whatever time I can with him.

{"id": "u/Dramatic_Fold4078_928", "user": "u/Dramatic_Fold4078", "text": "Weird Long Distance Experience...\n\nI (M, 23) was talking to this girl (F, 20) long distance for about 2.5 months. Everything seemed to be going really well. I was hesitant the first few weeks, but she was affectionate, we played video games together, really got to know her, visited her for 4 days, introduced me to her parents, had dinner with them, the trip itself was great. She expressed interest in continuing things, but since she’d never done long distance, she wanted to take it slow. I’d only done LDR once before, so I agreed.\n\nAfter I came back from the trip, she raised some concerns. She brought up an old TikTok comment I’d left on a friend’s post back in June (before we started talking; it was just a 🤗 emoji), and a more recent Instagram comment with the same friend (a “Lorax” quote, she was in a forest of some kind). I’d known this friend for 3 years we briefly flirted in college but it hasn’t been romantic since. I explained the context, unfollowed the friend, removed her as a follower, and tried to reassure her. She told me she appreciated the honesty, and admitted she’d naturally be upset, but I owned how it might have looked and thought we were good.\n\nA few days later, she went to a frat party (which I knew about). That night she didn’t check in, which made me anxious. The next day I brought it up calmly about my concerns, just trying to seek the same kind of reassurance she’d asked of me earlier. Initally, she said I had nothing to worry about, but later in the day she responded that she didn’t want to feel pressured or “have to check in all the time.” when she's out with friends, understandable I've had previous relationships like this. The very next day she ended things, saying the distance was too much and she needed to focus on school but said I was a great guy, treated her amazing, and made her feel \"seen\".\n\nI tried to fight for it, but she said she had too much going on. In my head, I can’t help but assume she ended it because of the situation with my friend, but I let it go. I know I was intentional, there was no malicious intent, and I wasn’t cheating on her.\n\nThat was less than two weeks ago.\n\nYesterday, she’s already publicly with a new guy ironically, a frat guy. Her friends are commenting “my favorite couple.”\n\nI’m hurt and confused by how fast she switched. Part of me wonders if I was a rebound, or if she really flipped her feelings for me that quickly over one interaction with a friend and got with a dude at the party. I saw long term potential, and now I just feel discarded.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? Was this a breakup or more like a discard?

We met when out 5 months ago when I was visiting family in Italy. Im from US. I’ve seen him for a full week of each month so far, he’s in college and my family loves seeing me so it’s working out that I’m coming. He did visit me in July though. I know basic Italian but since being with him have learned more and the effort. He does not have poor english, it was always easy to talk back and forth. But now I’m questioning just how much the language barrier affects him I guess mentally? I just came back home, we went out on the weekend drinking with friends and he def drank too much. Slurring his words in both languages, switching between them.. By the time we were home I was like let’s go to sleep. I mentioned that I couldn’t understand him in an annoyed way. I don’t like to get super drunk so don’t like it in others lol. He then got annoyed saying he never asks me to talk slower because I never did cuz I don’t care and so because of that “a lot of the time” he doesn’t know what I’m saying. He’s very respectful and still was then but I knew it wasn’t true because we talk fine?? After we woke I told him I didn’t know that actually was a problem, and of course he confirmed that it wasn’t but was in the past. But it’s like he expects me to know way more Italian, he’s improved seemingly more than me because he already knew so much and just been perfecting it daily. And I’m also the one that pursued him in the way that he told me he figured I wouldn’t want a relationship like that (long distance) so he was just gonna let go of the thought of me that way even though he felt what I did. The same as in I’ve never met someone before that just made me so happy being around them like I did. And I would not want a long distance relationship, but he’s just special lol. I didn’t know his age when we met, I guess I assumed at least 21 because I wasn’t thinking about how 18 is the drinking age\n\nBut as of lately I’m just randomly paranoid that he will hook up with a girl because I know it sounds stupid, but because he is attractive and guess I’m making stereotypes because of his age, that younger guys just want that. He also said in the past that he can’t wait until I’m so fluent so we can do it in his language and it feel just as natural for me or whatever. So that also is feeding my paranoia because “why wouldn’t he want someone who speaks his native language”? I guess you would say I’m the dominant one, so it just seems pathetic for me to be like I think you’re doing something wrong even though there’s no reason. Especially when I have soo much that confirms the opposite. In the beginning of August when I was there he introduce me to a good friend that was traveling when we got together so I never met him and my bf kinda got embarrassed but in a cute way about  the dude saying that I’m all he talks about. \n\nHas anyone been in something similar??, I’ve been in 3 relationships, longest being 1 year.

We met by chance in Germany at Oktoberfest while I was living in England and she lives in the US. \n\nI lived in England for 3 years, my visa ended back in May I have since returned to my home country of Australia. The original plan was for her to join me in Australia as she is a qualified Nurse and I have no university degrees. My plan was to always return when my visa ended and start studying to be Nurse/Paramedic which would have been the begin of February next year. \n\nWe decided in the June (2024) after we met that it would make the most sense for her to move to Australia to give me the opportunity to go to University and get a degree and it would be easier for her to get a work visa. I realised the more and more we discussed it that she wasn't very enthusiastic, she never really brought the idea up her self and this led to one of our biggest fights we've had. She reassured me that she would move to be with me but couldn't tell me when it would be. \n\nAs time went on I felt as though for our relationship to work I would need to be the one to move. I did my research and brought up to her that I wanted to move and what our options were, to get married and apply for a sposal visa or fiancée. We had discussed our future a lot at this point and I had it in my mind that I would be proposing before the year was over already. \n\nWhen my UK visa ended I returned to Australia with a stop over in the US to visit for 3 weeks. During this time I proposed the second day of arriving and we arranged our documents and relationship evidence to submit our petition to move me to the US to get married and live there. \n\nI knew there'd be a long wait for the visa, we are currently in month 3 of an estimated 9 month wait for the petition to be approved. This doesn't guarantee a visa there is another process after that and that could take another 5 months. Since I've been back I've been really struggling mentally, being in a place that doesn't feel like my home anymore, seeing old friends I don't feel like I really know anymore. Being back somewhere that I struggled mentally before, which is part of the reason I left in the first place. \n\nI've applied for so many jobs anything and everything I could. Entry level positions and I've only been able to get one interview. In England I was an emergency call operator for 2 and a half year and I applied for that job in Australia but that got rejected.

Unfortunately I'm in a position where there isn't really anyone can help me. I feel like I'm stuck in a holding pattern waiting for my visa to get hopefully approved but with no clear end in sight. \n\nI'm currently completing my GED to get a high school equivalency certificate to go to University in the US to pursue nursing but I didn't realise it's a longer process than it is here in Australia. I feel like I'm so far away from that goal currently that I dont know what to do with myself or where my life is heading. \n\nAt the end of next months I'm going to visit my fiancée for 7 weeks so hopefully that will help me reset and clear my head and get me out of somewhere I feel so negative all the time. \n\nThanks for reading, I just needed somewhere to get it all out 😤", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TIMEZONE_MISMATCH"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Even though he asked how I was (in response to older texts), he didn't even stay an extra minute to actually know before he slept...\n\nIt hurt me a lot because it reminded me of all the ways I go unacknowledged in the relationship. I try to make conversation over things that have been on my mind, for e.g., planes. I noticed a bunch of planes/helicopters fly by recently and taking different routes, and he asked me what I think is going on. I sent him some voicenotes...he listened to them, but never responds to them. I just feel like our convos always reach a dead end. There's barely any engagement aside from him asking me what I've eaten and how I'm feeling, that's about it. The mental stimulation is at an all time low and even when I try to enhance it, I feel like it's all my effort.\n\nKeep in mind, he's always down to call, videocall, watch movies...whatever I'm down for, as long as he's free, and he does so willingly...but there is very little initiative on his part to start an activity. Although when I do ask, he will be the one to set it up and have whatever show or movie I want ready. I asked if we could call every day even for a few mins at the end of the day, he was happy with the idea and said he'd love to, but there's no follow up. I asked him to do a personality test (for fun) months ago, and he still hasn't done it. It only takes 10 mins. Every time I ask, he says he was planning on doing it over the weekend.\n\nThe only time I really feel his mental/emotional presence is when I tell him I'm feeling bad; he reads all my texts, listens to my voicenotes, addresses my concerns. But I just wish he wasn't as absent on the good days and more present. I have discussed this with him but I just don't know what to do. He works from 9am - 6:30pm, goes to bed around 12ish, I do have a rich life outside of him, and engage with other facets of my life and take care of myself, and yet I still feel so depleted in the relationship.\n\nIn person, I would state my preference for outings, and he'd try his best to make that happen. He took really good care of me, and when I traveled again, he had sent me food, drinks, flowers, a teddy bear & note card when I got sick. So he has it in him, but idk what's going on or how to even address this issue...", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

With our circumstances we're currently only able to see each other every two weekends, sometimes less frequently. \n\nOnce we became official she was fairly honest with the fact that me watching porn while in this relationship made her very sad and made her feel like she's \"not enough\". I felt and still do feel that there was a strong disconnect or difference in regards to how each of us view porn, but regardless I told her that I would stop watching it because I hated to see her upset and wanted to make her feel safer. \n\nThat was almost a month ago now and I've found it quite difficult lately to resist the urge to use porn. I, for reference, have quite a high sex drive and when we're together we usually have sex at least once a day which she's happy with, and I don't think is that unusual considering our age and the fact that we usually haven't seen each other for weeks and only have one or two days with each other. I don't feel that that gets in the way of our time spent together either as we almost always get out of the house and do some more active things like walks, go shopping, dates etc. \n\nIn line with that, prior to this relationship I would generally masturbate most days but with some points where I wouldn't feel the desire to do it at all for a week or multiple weeks, and then the other way round when I would want to do it more often than usual. I figured that was in line with just general fluctuations in hormonal activity but I'm no doctor, so I've also considered the possibility that it could be an addiction. I didn't feel that that was it exactly as it doesn't get in the way of our sex life at all when we're actually together. I'm fully satisfied with spending my time with just her and my porn use doesn't lessen my desire for her, actually quite the opposite. \n\nAs time goes on and we continue to spend weeks apart, I feel a not-constant but frequent-enough desire to use porn once again since I can't be with her. She did let me take some pictures of her after some convincing (she was shy/embarrassed) so that I could use them instead of porn, which I have a number of times, but I feel a photo kind of starts to lose it's magic if you look at it for too long, in contrast to the real person where that is the source if that makes sense. \nI've also used my imagination as she suggested which works sometimes, but I still feel that these alternatives don't satisfy me, as I believe myself and from what I've researched, most men, derive a higher portion of their sexual satisfaction visually in comparison to women (once again not that I think she's visually unsatisfactory, she's beautiful, just that the alternatives don't stack up).\n\nThis has never affected my ability to perform for or satisfy my partner so besides the fact that it upsets her personally, I don't know if it's actually bad for me to do.\n\nI've seen so much contradicting information on this topic, and I don't know if this is unhealthy of me to feel this way, if it's something that she maybe needs to work on, or if it's genuinely an incompatibility between the two of us for which one of us needs to make a change in order to fix. \n\nTLDR - In a long distance relationship and me watching porn deeply upsets my girlfriend. I still feel the desire to watch it when we are apart.

My girlfriend(F22) and I would talk late into the night, sharing everything about our lives, including family and friends. I always tried my best to be there for her. We had arguments, but we always forgave each other. However, she had many male friends on Instagram.

I removed them because I thought sacrifices were necessary in a relationship.\n\nShe had been planning to do her master's abroad, specifically in Ireland, since the beginning of our relationship. I supported her throughout her IELTS test and everything else. But I had a gut feeling that she would forget me once she went to Ireland, and unfortunately, I was right. She went to Ireland a few days ago and has been distant. She barely texts me, and she didn't even say \"I love you\" until I asked her to.\n\nThere was a guy who helped her with her visa process, who was also from Ireland. She told me she would minimize contact with him once she arrived, and we agreed. However, she added him on Instagram, and when I confronted her, she said she needed him as a reference since she was alone there. When I reminded her of her promise, she laughed and didn't take me seriously. I was hurt and felt I had lost my self-respect. I told her I was blocking her, and she said it was okay if I wanted to end things. I blocked her on Instagram but not on WhatsApp.\n\nI'm unsure whether to wait for her message or end the relationship completely. I traveled and did everything for her, but my gut feeling about her was correct. My mental health is suffering, and I'm not feeling well. What should I do?

I desperately need advice and perspective from people who have been in LDRs.\n\nI (f24) met someone online (m24) about three months ago, and quickly became very close. It turned romantic and we started to really like each other, and I visited him last week. He lives in Portugal, I live in the US. We had the most amazing time together, and we both realized we’ve fallen in love. Being with him was the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. He has never really met someone that he wanted to really be with before (more hookups, nothing long term, and the few that he did really like hurt him badly). We both felt like we’d finally met the person we wanted to spend forever with. I met many of his friends, some of them referring to me as his girlfriend and saying he was so excited about me coming and wouldn’t stop talking about it. He’s never before introduced a girl to his friends before.\n\nI also completely fell in love with Portugal. Even without him, I genuinely loved being there. I have kind of always felt like something was missing or I was meant to do something else, and there I felt like I belonged and could see myself there. The pace and ways of life just fit me so well, and I am homesick for there. I have always daydreamed about moving somewhere else and joked about it, deep down not joking, and honestly really don’t want to be in the US anymore.\n\nLeaving was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The pained look on his face when my car was pulling away literally haunts my dreams. I have been back for 48 hours and feel like my heart has been torn in two and half of it stayed there with him.\n\nI am fully aware that given more time together, we might end up not being a match. Like all couples, sometimes you end up not fitting. So I’m not saying he IS the one, just that right now it feels like it, I want to give it a fair shot but HATE long distance, and I feel absolutely hollow being back here.\n\nNow for the reality of it. Being with him means moving away, and I am very close with my family. My mom is one of my best friends, and I’ve always imagined being close to them when I have kids. I love holidays with them. Random visits. They are my people, and while I need my people, I have always said that I think once I have my PERSON I think I could go further from them and not have them as my main support system.\n\nToday someone told me that I’d be choosing a boy over my family. And it pains me to think about losing my family. Not seeing my parents age or my grandparents before they pass or missing little get togethers. Not raising a family with them around.\n\nOn one hand, this absolutely kills me. On the other, I feel like moving just across the ocean (I’m on east coast, he’s on west), is not that different than my sister who lives across the country and we see maybe twice a year. The only real difference is that she can hop in a car when flights are too expensive. So logically, I know it wouldn’t be the end of the world, considering I would move away eventually anyway, but emotionally I feel terrible about it. Torn in two again.\n\nI guess I’m so absolutely overwhelmed by emotions and input from people who don’t understand that I’m at such a loss of what to do. I really really really want to get back to him asap. I want to spend maybe a month or two with him and see the reality of it a bit better. But I’m scared to get hurt worse if I end up deciding I can’t leave my family after all that time with him. On the other hand, I can’t imagine life without him right now, and I need to choose what is best for me and go where I feel called to. I feel like I can’t handle not being with him, but also don’t know if I could handle being away from my people here.\n\nI don’t know whether it’s normal to feel so torn in an LDR. I don’t know how you guys handle the grief and pain and yearning, and would love literally any and all advice you guys could give.\n\nTLDR: Met my long distance bf online 3 months ago, spent a week together last week in person at his place in Portugal. Realized we’re in love. Also absolutely loved Portugal and would love to live there regardless of him. Went back to USA and missing him like crazy. Feeling absolutely shattered in long distance and don’t know how to cope. Want to go back asap to get out of this pain, but also want to spend a month or two there to see more of the reality of life with him. However, super close with my fam here, and would miss them so so badly moving permanently. Concerned that I shouldn’t even let this go on if I’m unsure if I could do the move, but also don’t know if I’m thinking too big right now.

Im also learning now that Im in a space with a lot more of it that im afraid of consuming it and hanging around people who do to an extent that may be irrational, which is something im trying to work on.\n\nwhen my boyfriends first weekend came up, him and a bunch of new friends he had found a way to get some alcohol from one of their parents, which was already unnerving to me so i spoke to him about it. i told him it made me nervous and he told me that he would not drink that much when he went to a frat party that his friends planned on going to later. that whole night i was very anxious, and because of my overthinking. when he got in touch with me next hours later, he was much more drunk than either of us had anticipated. and because i was overthinking, anxious and checking his location, i ended up accusing him of cheating the next day, which i was totally wrong for. we talked about it for a long time today, and a main point we talked about was that the sudden alcohol use kinda threw me for a loop and i didn't know what to expect, so when i saw him at a location that was not the frat's chapter house, i let my anxiety get the best of me. i told him that the alcohol use also does just generally scare me, but that i did not want to keep him from having fun, and i wanted him to do what he wants and to enjoy college.\n\nlater tonight, he had what i thought was a formal fundraiser event because of what he told me about the dress code, turns out the fundraiser was just a cover charge to a party with a formal dress code (total accidental miscommunication -- no ones fault). he and his friends all pre-gamed or post-gamed the party and he texted me late tonight he said that he had too much to drink and had to rely on his friends to get back to his dorm. which frankly scared me half to death. as he told me about the rest of the night i tried to be supportive of his choices and be kind, but i did tell him it was still an adjustment.\n\ni just feel so lost and confused and worried. i never expected him to go this hard into it when he got to college and its scary to me because of how ive seen it tear apart my family. ive ended up feeling less close to my friends whove started drinking and im worried its going to drive a wedge between us like it did for me and those other friends. im planning on going to counseling about my worries regarding alcohol to help me work through it because i dont want him to feel like he cant do what he wants because of me. im worried that i wont be able to sustain a long term relationship with someone who drinks that much, and im also worried that i when i plan on flying out to see him that im going to either prevent him from going to parties he wants to go to or that im going to be dragged to one and be in that environemnt which im scared of.\n\nit feels as if i have arachnophobia, and that he just bought a pet turantula and joined a spider lovers group. i want to support what he wants to do, but the thing itself scares the snot out of me.\n\nThank you so much for any advice\n\nTL:DR - my boyfriends sudden increase in alcohol use in college and my trauma and fears relating to my loved ones drinking are causing a lot of problems for me.\n\nEDIT: i shouldve added that he said that hes going to ramp it down as classes start this tuesday, but its not because of my fears that hes going to do it but to focus on schoolwork (i did tell him that i did not want my worried to prevent him from doing what he wants). for that reason i am worried that i'll still be experiencing the same anxiety on weekends when him and his friends will most likely still be going out.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

This is truly incredibly hard for me to deal with, we’ve met up in person numerous times now and have stayed at each others houses for weeks. What makes this hardest is she has the sweetest family who struggle with money a bit, and a few flights until January next year have been booked already, as well as my own. She was with this person before I came into her life, not long before but before. They weren’t “official” but still said they loved each other, still kissed and still went to eachother families. I saw texts about the way she’d lie to me about being out with friends when she was with him. I just feel so hurt she played me like that when she was the sweetest girl ever to me. How could my baby do that? She’s worked so hard to be better for our relationship. She did break things off with everyone to focus on me but that never should’ve happened in the first place. I really do want to love her. But I hate her so much for what she’s done to me. I know a lot of people tend to pull the “you’re young, break up” but throughout my life I never even wanted a relationship. She’s the only person I’ve dated because I’ve refused to date anyone else despite the chances. The way it is when we’re together is so magical. I just can’t believe she even had the capacity to wrong me so horribly. It feels like the sweet girl I knew doesn’t exist, she takes full accountability and responsibility for her actions and doesn’t try justify them. She’s been working to help me and she’s being getting relationship therapy with a councillor. I really do want this to work. But I don’t know how to go moving forward. I was doing okay, I found this out a while ago and recently I had sort of come to terms with it despite obviously being absolutely devastated, but last night I just completely broke down. I told her this morning I don’t want to speak to her for a few days because of what she’s done, and the fact I have exams. Please, please give me genuine advice and how I can move FORWARD. I really don’t just want to hear people shaming the actions because I know more than anyone how foul they are. I’m not giving her another chance past this, I understand I need to respect myself. She should’ve loved me from the start I know. I know that. I just want to fix things because she really is trying, but if she doesn’t I’m not staying in this relationship.

I cannot move away for 4+ years. We have already done two years of long distance in the past.\n\nMy boyfriend 22M and I 22F have been together for 3 years now. We did long distance (5 hours, same state) for two years while we were both doing our undergraduate degree at different universities. My undergraduate university is in the same city where we are from. I applied to various graduate schools in state (PhD programs), and I took my only offer, which is at the school he is currently still attending for undergrad (I am one year ahead). \n\nSo for one year, we are both students at the same school. He’s contemplating moving back home for better work opportunities. There are definitely more connections, probably higher pay, and his family is there (along with mine).\n\nHe’s also contemplating staying here to be closer to me. It’s a lower cost of living here, and he does have quite a few connections from living here the past four years. It would be feasible to get a job here, but it would probably be remote or lesser pay (he is an IT/business guy). However, he’s very conflicted because he knows it would most likely be best to go back home 5 hours away. He’s in severe emotional distress about it.\n\nWe are really enjoying the start of our year together, especially after being long distance for so long. It’s really hard to fathom for the both of us that he could be going away for 4+ years (until I finish my PhD). I told him that we both know what the best option for his career is (moving away), and to not think about me in this situation.\n\nHowever, I kind of wish I could tell him to consider me in the situation too. But I don’t know if that’s wrong or not. I know it’s his career, and ultimately that is really what’s most important. But it’s devastating to the b both of us to think about its impact on our relationship. We want to get engaged within 1-2 years and not waste time starting a family once I graduate. To me, everything will seem so thrown off if we have a four year gap in our plans. \n\nIs it okay to tell him that I also want to be considered in this decision? I mean, I have told him that of course it’ll make me very sad for him to go. But I have said nothing along the lines of I should be one of the main deciding factors. I know that if I was in his shoes, I most likely would stay with my partner. But I obviously can’t coerce him like that, nor do I want to.

My long distance boyfriend (29) and I (28) have been dating for 2 years online. He lives in the UK and I live in the US. We’ll be meeting each other for the first time, finally, in person at the end of November. Im excited but also nervous. Everything’s been great except for the fact that he has a girl best friend who he knew before me. He also met her online but through gaming and he actually met up with her one on one back in July for the first time in London. Which seems like a lot to go travel on a train to see another woman for an entire day even if it’s his best friend. But he texted me the entire time to calm my nerves which did help a little. However I still feel super nervous about his friendship with her. I will say my last relationship ended because my ex cheated on me with our close friend. So I do feel like I have trauma with female friends. The girl and him are in a gaming group together that gets together once a week for a raid. They also share a smaller group chat with 2-3 other guys where she’s the only girl. Recently, I found that he has liked almost every pic she’s posted on IG since when they met, as well as posts on her second account. These pics range from her in ball gowns at a book con event to her bending for a golf shot in a mini skirt. I’ve confronted him about how I feel and he denies there being anything.

She has a discord server which he openly told me he is in. The thing that does settle me is that she is married. However, he mentioned them having relationship issues which made me wonder how deep their talks are. It also doesn’t just worry me that he’s going to cheat on me with her but that more so he’s lusting after her/wants what he can’t have. I get dark thoughts where he thinks about her instead of me a lot of the time.. and I sometimes feel like he’s with me out of convenience. Outside of this though he’s been amazing to be with. He’s super supportive, caring, thoughtful.. but when his girl best friends name comes up, it feels different. Am I overreacting to be upset about him liking all of his girl best friends photos?

I notice that he is often emotionally distant and tends to respond in a practical, rather than emotionally supportive, way when I react emotionally. Sometimes it even feels like my emotionality is a bit of an “inconvenience” for him. At the same time, I understand him, because we are very different people: I am more emotional, and he is more practical. I also know that he often feels that a lot is resting on his shoulders due to our long-distance relationship, the planning of our move, and the visa process, because he is the one who will make most of the money to support us. I recognize that I can work on how I react in certain situations, but I also need support so I don’t feel alone with my emotions, otherwise it only makes everything worse.\n\nA current example is our discussion about our wedding and the visa process. The easiest way for me to live in his country would be to get married. We considered starting the engagement visa first, since the process can take six to eight months before everything is approved. However, I would like a proper proposal and a small celebration, which delays things because we need to save money for that. Emotionally, I am torn: on one hand, I want to be with him, because I am ready to start my life with him now. On the other hand, I also want certain things, like a proper celebration, which is hard for me to give up.\n\nWhen I talked to him about how I feel today, his reaction was rather distant and pragmatic. He said we could have already taken care of everything by simply signing the papers without any celebration. In that situation, I would have liked more emotional closeness from him instead of practical answers, because I felt alone with my emotions. At the same time, I understand that he feels stressed carrying the responsibility for the getting these things started and our financial situation, and that it overwhelms him when I also react so emotionally.\n\nIt’s important to me to be able to tell him that I need more emotional closeness, even though I know I also need to learn to handle some things better. But I can’t just suppress my feelings, and I don’t want to feel alone with them. At the same time, I want to learn how to take some weight off his shoulders. However, I feel that he often takes things on automatically without including me. For example, I don’t have a complete overview of what is needed for the visa process. When I ask, he says he will include me, but then he takes care of it himself. I wish we could find a compromise: that he shows me where he really needs my support, and that I can tell him when I need emotional closeness.\n\nAnother issue in our relationship is that he feels like I can’t handle being in my home country alone, because I cry and feel very sad a lot of times. This stresses him even more, because he feels responsible for me, which adds to the weight already on his shoulders. I want to make it clear that it’s not that I can’t manage being without him. Rather, the distance itself makes me feel emotionally more distant and uncertain about our relationship, and I cry because that is my way of expressing my emotions.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship, emotional closeness worked very well. He used to write long messages in the evening, telling me how much he loves me, how much he values me, and how much our relationship means to him. Reading those messages in the morning made me feel emotionally closer to him, even when he was sometimes less emotionally expressive or a bit distant in other areas. Nowadays, he no longer writes such messages, and I think this is one reason why I feel more emotionally distant and feel that something is missing in our relationship. I’m not saying he has to start writing these messages again, but we need to find another way to restore emotional closeness.\n\nWhen we are together in person, it’s easier for me to read his emotions: I can see his body language and facial expressions, which makes him feel less distant. Even when he is tired and talks little, he shows affection through gestures like hugs or a kiss on the head. On distance, I lack this nonverbal communication, which makes his short or minimal responses feel cold and makes me feel insecure.\n\nOverall, I hope we can find ways to restore emotional closeness over distance, that I can take some of the weight off his shoulders without overwhelming him, and that we can clearly communicate where we each need support and closeness.\n\n\nI just would like to hear some opinions on this and how I could talk to him", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

We were sitting next to each other at a cafe. She had just graduated high school. We were both in San Francisco at the time, which is where her family lives and where I go to college. I got her number and we went on 4 dates between June and August of 2024. When summer ended, she had to leave SF to start her freshman year at university in New York City.\n\nWhen she left, we agreed to visit each other but made no formal commitments as we weren’t sure how a long distance relationship could work. Over the next 2 months, I visited her three times in new york for 3 long weekends. After deliberating back and forth, we eventually decided on become official after the third Visit in November 2024. We stayed long distance throughout the next 9 months of the school year with 1 visit every ~2 months, including a month long visit to SF during winter break.\n\nThis last summer (June 2025 - August 2025), she came back to SF again and we were able to spend 3 days a week together like last year. I met her family and we grew closer, and then she left a few weeks ago.\n\nHere’s the problem: I don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to be in person together permanently, at least not in the near future. It’s definitely not impossible, but it’s not guaranteed either. I have a job lined up for next summer as an investment banker here in San Francisco, while she wants to stay in NYC for art opportunities. That means we probably won’t get to spend summer together like in 2024 and 2025. After that, my hope is to get a return offer to work full time in SF and then eventually change offices to NYC after my first 6-12 months of work in SF to be with her in NYC. That’s a minimum of 2.5-3 more years of long distance, with no guarantee I’ll be able to lateral to NYC in that timeframe.\n\nThere’s a possibility she could end up working an art gig here in SF, but I know her dream is to work in NYC and she’ll still be in college there for another 3 years. I am very much in love with my girlfriend and I absolutely see her by my side in the very long term, if circumstances would permit it.

Everything went great for the most part and then a few weeks before my areas rodeo came up, i mentioned to him that i might go because i go every year. So let’s fast forward to the day before i go and i told him that my mom talked me out of it and i didn’t really want to go anyway because the same people go every year and what not, and then he says “i think you should go i think it’d be very fun” (keep in mind he does not remember saying this or even remember having this conversation but i do and i swear on my life he said this), and then i said to him that it would probably start an argument… and then he said that it definitely would…. okayy???? then don’t say it would be fun to go to..\n\nSo I went, and I told him and I even pulled in while on the phone with him.

Cj, who’s my brother’s friend and someone I trust, came to check on me, and I told him I felt like I was gonna throw up. He told me to lay down inside, so I did and just went to sleep. The second night, my boyfriend ignored me all day and all night no matter how many times I called. I got super upset and ended up drunk and crying, and then my ex randomly showed up, which was just a whole thing. Two guys came around with Sharpies wanting signatures, and I only signed their necks and let them sign my back…nothing else…because I was still respecting my relationship. After that, I just grabbed some food and called it a night. On the last night, I stuck with Adriana and Shyanne again. We went out with some Wisconsin guys who told us they had girlfriends which made Adriana, Shyanne and I pretty comfortable, ate, bought swimsuits, and went swimming in the river. Later at the campsite the Sharpie guys came around again, but I didn’t let them sign me this time. My ex was still hanging around, apparently because he came just to see me, but Cj didn’t even want him there. Around midnight the cops showed up because of a fight, and they started checking for underage drinking, so the three of us girls just stayed low in the camper until they left. When it was finally time to sleep, it ended up being Shyanne in the middle, me on one side, and Cj on the other, but I was already knocked out before they even got in.\n\nso now the tea really begins:\n\nmy boyfriend started getting all sorts of texts saying that i was cheating.. that i was sleeping with Cj, Flirting with guys, knowing that all of the guys that were in the camper with all of girls, can say that i wasn’t cheating or flirting, there was rumors of apparently me getting an STD and how i did cocaine which i can literally get get someone to confirm isn’t true because i literally had DRILL THE NEXT MORNING .. oh and someone brought up how when i was blackout drunk in June (after boyfriend ended things with me the first time) that apparently i slept with a dude, and i don’t remember it all. someone had to tell me that it happened when i woke up the next morning.\n\ni knew who it was that organized the group and SAM had my boyfriends number. because i seen the names on the snapchat screenshots. these were people i didn’t even know and people that didnt like me that were coming up against me to get my boyfriend to break up with me. it was my ex, Sam.\n\neverything was fine, after we talked about it until i sent a message along the lines of “is everything okay? things just don’t seem intimate anymore and you don’t really want to talk to me?” i tried to put the conversation off and then he told me we needed to talk about it now. so i called him and he basically told me that he can’t trust me, i was obviously confused because he said he believed me just a few days ago.. and i just straight up told him, im not going to be with someone that doesn’t trust me. i say that we should be done. he says “i guess this is goodbye” as i was expecting him to fight for me…i hung up and i blocked him on every social media platform..\n\nlike what do i even do in this scenario??\n\nTL;DR: Went to my town’s rodeo with my friends, stayed respectful the whole time, but my ex stirred up rumors that I cheated/partied wild; my bf believed the hearsay over me, so we ended things.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He suddenly went cold, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m in a long-distance relationship and things have really shifted recently. In the beginning, he was so sweet and consistent - checking in, making me feel cared for, and really putting in the effort despite the distance. But lately, he’s gone cold. My messages are left on “delivered,” and when he does reply, it feels distant and unlike how he used to be.\n\nI’m torn between giving him space (because maybe he’s stressed or going through something) and reaching out (because the silence is making me anxious). Part of me worries that he’s losing interest or maybe met someone else, but another part wonders if I’m overthinking.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been in LDRs or experienced this sudden shift:\n1. How do you balance giving space with wanting clarity?\n2. How do you stop your mind from spiraling when someone pulls away like this?\n3. At what point do you take silence as your answer?\n\nAny advice or perspective would really help.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/Apprehensive-Cry2104_989", "user": "u/Apprehensive-Cry2104", "text": "25F and 28M is it wrong that I like him less? I love him though\n\nHi! I’m 25F and my boyfriend is 28M. He was supposed to visit me in Florida from Texas before I move to Spain for a teaching program for a year.\n\nLong story short, we argued about finances. He didn’t like the idea of me going this year because he thought I should save more and just wait until next year. I bluntly told him he doesn’t have to support my decision—nobody does, I’m used to it. I already saved what I could and bought my ticket. That led to us not talking for a day which led to me thinking about other things he has said to me in the past like having one sex dream and my younger sister 21F was in it but I was the one he was having sex with she was just in another room of area, or the fact he has a girl best friend he used to like , but he said he doesn’t like her anymore or just the fact it feels like I have to the saver money wise alone because he really can’t save.. my brain was just spiraling about our whole relationship but I eventually i somewhat calm down because good things happened with us and he’s the first boyfriend i ever got to meet in person and spend time with and he doesn’t curse or yell at me like my last relationship so those are things I try to consider…  so When we did talk again, I apologized first .\n\nThen he told me it would cost him about $1,150 to get from Texas to Florida, which seemed odd since he originally said he’d drive, not fly. Then he switched it up and said, “I’ll just come to Spain instead.” But honestly, I know how much it costs to prep and fly to Spain, and it’s way more expensive—so I doubt he’s coming at all.\n\nLater, I found out he never even booked the Florida hotel. He made it seem like he did, then a week later said, “come to find out princess, it never booked, I thought it did.” I just brushed it off.\n\nOn top of that, my grandma passed this month (after other family losses too), so I’ve been really struggling emotionally. Meanwhile, he asked me for money for his car insurance… while also spending on an after-party for his photography. I told him no, because I need to save for my move. Even my dad said it was selfish of him.\n\nToday, he was basically MIA. By the time he texted me, it was night. He apologized and said he just didn’t want to be on the phone much, and that he feels happier talking to people in person. He’s a really social guy, so it kind of felt like a jab at me—that he’s tired of being on the phone with me. I told him I’d just watch a movie and go to sleep because I wasn’t in the mood after that.\n\nI guess I’m just confused. Part of me feels like he’s avoiding putting in effort, and another part of me wonders if I’m being too sensitive because I’ve had so much going on lately. Am I wrong for feeling over it? Should I keep trying here? I really don’t know how to feel about him right now, I don’t really feel close to him sometimes.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

My bf (23) is a NEET. (*Not in Education, Employment or Training*). Now I (F21) have been in an online relationship for close to 4 years now. We have never met. We live in the same time zone but live hours away. Our situations wont let us meet anytime soon... it sucks. Our relationship is completely secret as well. We both got mexican parents that just wouldnt understand and as a woman in a strict mexican household its not like i can fly over to see him. and ALSO i got more to say on top of that cause this is whats so damn frustrating...\n\n  \nBut before that... this is a little backstory. So we actually met on Reddit. I instantly liked him. hes everything I've ever wanted. We understood eachother in deeper levels. long story short. I am so in love with this guy. I know for a fact I wont find anyone else like him. i just feel like i wont ever find anyone i get along with more than him. So in my head he is the one. I wanna be with him forever. And like of course He gives me all his attention cause like what the fuck else does he got going on. He tells me I'm the center of his universe. He wakes up and it's all about me me me. He loves me so much. Every year we love eachother more. I don't need to go into details or anything its been 4 years ya'll get it.\n\nBut here's the thing.. He is a NEET which is literally my main problem. (like yeah I love that he seems to have me as the highlight of his life because i love his attention) but REALISTICALLY like every now and again I come back to reality and think about how we would ever be together.. now some backstory on him. He lives with his mom and brother in a tiny apartment. he sleeps in the living room so he has no privacy. never did growing up. So since we are a secret, we can't call eachother or anything. we mainly communicate through text. occasianly when possible, voice messages. so that is kinda hard because I just need a little more but i understand the situation so its okay. Now he also has severe anxiety. he tends to not leave the house much. He probably has only left the hous like 3 times this year. (hes spamming me rn haha as i write this. I've been a little avoident recently. but god damnnit i love him) anyways I've brought up my concerns multiple times. its always the same thing... he thinks he has some sort of medical problem but it's just a physical symptom of his anxiety and also the fact that he doesn't move around much. His mom cares a lot too. I know she loves him so much but shes enabling him. He needs help and i wish i was there to help him. \n\nBackstory on me. I'm in University and I'm struggling figuring that shit out. Gonna graduate way later than I was supposed to cause yk advisors kinda suck sometimes. I'm working and just overall working towards my future. Trying my best here. Especially because one day I wanna be with him. And I know I sometimes end up in the \"i need to save him\" mentality. But NOOOO. cant. nope. im not doing that. I've just been waiting  like each month.. im like \"okay okay. maybe he'll go out on a walk soon or do something that shows some kind of improvement or direction.\" then its like the same cycle. just kind of waiting to see if something happens while I'm over here trying my best to do shit with my life. with his love and support haha.\n\nThere was a significant moment that almost pushed me over the edge. My cousin and her boyfriend invited me and my brother to go on vacation to HIS STATE. HIS CITY. so you know im over here planning and scheming. anywasy fast forward. my cousin and her bf go on a date in the city and my brother wanted to stay in the hotel and drink and be alone. And i decided to go on my own adventure into the city. I wanted to test if i wouldn't get lost taking public transportation around. fast forward I did. I eventually found my way back to the hotel. my brother made fun of me. i went to go shower and i was all the sudden really upset. I was texting him about how maybe it's possible to meet up with him. (he lives like 30 minutes away from the city. and since he has no job he has no car) So if i wanted to see him I would have to go out of my way to try and get to him. So anyways back to me in the bathroom naked and crying. So im really sad and upset. because I cant see him. And i was in my head thinking about like if this was any other regular guy they would easily come and see me. Like guys do crazy shit just to spend a minute with you. so its just frustrating. Like this guy on the train was literaly talking with me and flirting with me and it just makes me sad like hes a real person and i wish it was my bf like i cant talk to him in person. he doesnt think its safe for me and also it just wasnt a realistic idea to take public transport. im too lazy to explain it but it just wasn't possible with the whole situation. I was just upset because it was the fact that he just doesnt do shit that we couldnt see eachother when i was there. And i'm unfiltering myself so much rn but like im not like this with him. these are my true inner thoughts. when i bring up this topic im straightforward but not in a rude way. \n\nAnyways i feel like i just spewed out word vomit. sorry if this doesnt make sense. It just sucks and idk if it's worth it anymore. But like at the same time I literally dont want anyone else. No one else compares to him. Plus guys irl make me feel sick in the stomach. \n\nI wanna know if any of you guys are in the same situation. I know it sounds like I am completly over this. but it would take a lot for me to potentially end this. it would hurt so much. It's just logically i dont think this is worth it. but thinking with my heart, I want it to be.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He’s been supportive when I lost a close family member and to be honest he’s just been really supportive throughout the 9 months of which has been one of the most difficult years I’ve ever had. He never asks or expects anything in return, he’s just always there. We get on great, I always want to know about his life and find out more about him. \n\nWe call when we can.\n\nHe tells me I’m beautiful etc but then he always drops the ‘I want to stay single, I enjoy being single’ whenever we start getting really close. He’s always really busy working long hours (he often sends me photos of work or him at work) and I do genuinely believe there’s nothing sketchy going on. He moved house recently and I made a joke saying give me a tour when you’re moved in and he did - there’s no sign of any other female.\n\nHe’s been openly honest with me and told me he got divorced 2 years ago, he wasn’t happy and he left. He told me that he feels like another relationship would be a lot of pressure and that he is afraid of commitment (I’m disappointed at this point) then he said if he did want a relationship the only person he would want one with would be me… which I really don’t know how to feel about that.\n\nAnyway, he’s always been honest with me but I feel so attached to him despite never meeting him. I miss him sometimes when we don’t talk as much during the day if he’s super busy with work or I’m busy. \n\nSometimes he talks to me as if we are in a relationship and it gives me mixed signals and he’s agreed with me that he unintentionally does this and he doesn’t mean to. He claims he’s ’not romantic in the slightest’ but then he will do certain things that to me, show he actually does care for me on a deeper level but maybe I’m entirely deluded.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where we exchange nudes (my idea… he doesn’t force me to do anything) and we agreed that we won’t even touch ourselves unless the other knows about it or we will wait until a time where we are both free yet he says he doesn’t want commitment. He also told me he wouldn’t want to compete with any other guy if I was doing the same with someone else (there has been nobody since him and I started talking) \n\nHe’s always been upfront and told me if he met someone in his country, he would tell me if he went out on dates etc but he’s not looking for anyone right now and he is happy the way things are.\n\nTL:DR I guess my whole point I need advice on comes down to the question of - can you really just talk to someone platonically as a friend every single day for hours on end and not develop any feelings towards them. \n\nWould you spend hours talking to someone every single day for 9 months (even when you’re busy) just because you wanted the company (even though he has plenty friends) \n\nAm I completely overthinking this and getting attached to a stranger for nothing?

We met in a hostel and hit it off immediately. The connection was rare — emotionally deep, physically strong, and just felt like we really got each other. We spent a few intense days together in Vienna, then kept in touch afterwards, speaking almost every day.\n\nNot long after, we started seeing each other in person again, despite living hours apart. Everything felt right — we opened up about our traumas, futures, hopes, and fears. She looked after me during a difficult moment when I broke down about my dad, and I felt I could be fully vulnerable around her — something I’ve never experienced before. We told each other we loved one another and it wasn’t just said lightly.\n\nBut as the time for her to go to university got closer, things changed. She became overwhelmed and emotionally distant. Eventually, she told me she couldn’t give me what I deserved and that the timing just wasn’t right. We had a really emotional phone call and I ended up driving 5 hours unannounced to see her, not to win her back, but to say everything I needed to say in person. She was happy to see me — we had a lovely night, talked honestly, shared a moment of real connection (we even slept together again), and told each other “I love you.”\n\nAfter that, we agreed to stay in contact. We still speak every day, share little life updates, and talk about how much we miss each other. But it’s not quite the same — she’s clearly trying to emotionally distance herself. She’s said things like “I just want you,” or “I don’t want to find someone else,” but then also says she shouldn’t call me or get too close again. It feels like she’s trying to force a disconnect, even when she doesn’t really want to.\n\nI’m trying to respect her space and not hang onto false hope, but deep down I do believe that what we had was rare and that if life brings us back together at a better time, we could have something real.

They have abused and controlled me my whole life. Now I have a boyfriend of 2 years which is definitely not allowed by them. We’re “medium distance” as in he’s an hour away in a different state and I’m only able to see him once a month. My family recently found out about us and they just found some pictures I have of us on my instagram. I didn’t have my name on there and blocked mostly everyone thinking these old fucks wouldn’t know how to find me. I just went private and blocked the one aunt who found it. My youngest aunt and uncle who are evil incarnate, sent the pictures to my mom and threatened to send them to my dad who is the real issue. My mom is on my side but she’s afraid they’ll threaten to kick me out, expose me to everyone we know in the muslim community, and potentially ruin my sister’s lives since they’ll be ostracized.

I said that since I’m starting a new job soon I can lie and say I’m going to work and then see him on the weekends. What should we do? I don’t want this ruining my relationship. We love each other very much and my boyfriend reassured me that he doesn’t want to leave me even though it could be difficult to see each other.

Idk unusual, but yea I decided not to go back. This summer, after 14 months online, we finally met in Tunisia, and honestly it was the best week of my life. She was everything I’d ever dreamed of and more. \n\nBut here’s where my problem lies, a little before Tunisia it’s almost like my feelings turned gray, like suddenly all the amazing passion I had for her went out the window and I was left with a husk of what I once felt. We almost split because of it and canceled the trip. But we called, made up, and I decided it was just because of disconnection.\n\nI’ve recently just started college, and now those feelings are back. When I was on the mission the plan was always two years and then she’d be here. It was long, but gave us something to look forwards to. I had never felt such stronger feelings of love. But right now there’s no date to count down to, I’m saving up for the fiancée visa, everything’s unsure. Maybe that’s part of it? \nBut recently I look around and I see girls, I even briefly chat with a few. And I hate this but I catch myself wondering if my girl isn’t the one. I imagine myself drivin a different girl around in my truck, and I hate that. But it almost feels freeing. And I feel so lost because I don’t know where my feelings went. It’s like they’ve taken up and left. I don’t know why. Maybe there’s some core issue we haven’t truly resolved yet? Idk. She’s an angel, super sweet, emotional, genuinely looks like a supermodel, cute accent. She’s just a sweetheart. We did things in Tunisia that we’d said we’d never do before marriage. I almost feel stuck now. I can’t just take off and leave, I’ve given a part of myself to her. But I don’t know where my heart went. It’s depressing me. I missed her so much after I left Tunisia, but now it’s like I don’t even remember it anymore.\n\nI just need someone to read this and offer their 2 cents", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I feel completely lost.\n\nReddit deleted it so I'll post it again\n\nI honestly don't know how to deal with this. She was the love of my life for 6 years. She completed me in every way, always respected me, and I truly felt like she was made for me and I was made for her.\n\nBecause of life circumstances, we had to be in a long-distance relationship. For months she kept telling me that distance didn't matter, that I was the right person, that she wanted to marry me.\n\nBut in July she ended things because of the distance. I don't believe it was just the distance, but that was the reason she gave. Now it's September, I broke no contact and sent her a message. She takes forever to answer, just like in the beginning, before we were even together. The only difference is that back then she fell in love with me and never left me waiting again. Now, after the breakup, she does, and it hurts so much.\n\nIt hurts because the person I wanted most in this world put a final point on a story that, for me, still had so much to give and fight for. It's very hard knowing that one day someone else will receive what I received: the purest and most special love. The person who ends up with her will live the life I dreamed of having with her: getting married, having kids, and building a life together. That hurts even more.\n\nShe is a rare person in this generation. She doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke, she doesn't go to many parties, and to top it off, she was very similar to me. Even her family was similar to mine, in a good way.\n\nI miss her so much, how we were, everything we had. I don't know if I'll ever get over this. I just wanted her forever, because with her my life was happier and my heart more complete. She has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. But unfortunately, it ended because of things neither of us could control. Still, deep down, I feel like distance wasn't the only reason, but I'll never know for sure.\n\nToday, I told her that I am dreaming about her every day. She asked how I was, I said bad, and she replied that she's fine and that she has already moved on. Later, when I asked again if she really moved on, she didn't answer directly, just said she doesn't want to talk about it so she won't hurt me. I cry every day even my mother cried with me I was diagnosed with depression and recently I'm thinking about suicide I know it's bad but it's much worse to spend a lifetime thinking \"and if it wasn't for the distance\" because I'm sure that if it weren't for the distance I would stay with her for the rest of my life and I would be the happiest person of this time and I get so bad when I think that someone will live my dream life\n\nI don't know how to deal with this.

[23M / 23F]\n\nHey everyone, I’ve [23M] been reconnecting with my ex [23F] (we dated back in high school for about two years until we graduated at the end of 2020). We were “high school sweethearts” — lived in the same city, went to the same school. I’m more of an old-school romantic type: I love writing letters, dedicating songs, and I’m very affectionate/physical. She’s a bit colder and struggles to express feelings, but back then she showed me enough that I never doubted she loved me.\n\nFast forward to now, we’re not officially back together, but we’ve been really close again these past 2 months (saying what we feel of each other still after many years, even I’m considering planning a trip to her she lives currently at the end of this semester). Most nights we fall asleep on video calls, and I guess I got used to that routine because it feels really comforting.\n\nThe thing is, right now I’m studying in Mexico while she’s at university in the US. She likes going out with her roommate (her best friend), and she’s been socializing more. I know it’s normal and she deserves to enjoy her life, but I get anxious when she goes out and I don’t hear back from her.\n\nExample: yesterday she went clubbing, and I went to a bar near my place. On the way back, she actually tried to call me, but I was in the shower. About 30 minutes later I texted to see if she was home, but she didn’t reply anymore. Today she still hadn’t answered, and I caught myself checking her Instagram to see if she was active… which only made me spiral harder.\n\nI think my fear comes from two things:\n\t•\tI saw a close friend’s LDR fall apart because his girlfriend would go out on weekends and “disappear,” and it drove him crazy.\n\t•\tMy ex told me that after we broke up, she dated a few guys who were very clingy and suffocating, and she hated it. Ironically, that was my biggest fear when we were together — but recently she told me she never felt that way with me, and actually liked that I wasn’t like that.\n\nSo now I’m stuck. On one hand, I’d love if she could just send me a quick “I’m home” or “going to sleep” text when she can’t talk, just for peace of mind. On the other hand, I don’t want to come off as controlling or make her feel like she has to “report” to me.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this?

And how do you ask for a little more reassurance without sounding needy or controlling?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["SILENCE_GAP", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He’s been really stressed with work and finances and managing a house on his own (even though his family live with him they don’t really help out and leave a mess that he has to clean up), he’s in a lot of pain and will potentially need surgery for an ongoing problem, not to mention the political climate (he lives in the USA). I’ve been struggling to find a full-time job, been recovering from surgery myself, the political climate here (UK) is scary and I’ve had some family issues going on. Not to mention we’ve both been feeling the distance a little more than usual. So we’ve both been really stressed and a little snappy with one another but we’ve always been able to circle back and talk it through.\n\nI’d just returned to my part time job yesterday after two months off, a six hour cleaning shift at a fairly popular gym and pool - so nothing too egregious but it was still a challenge for me because my surgery site was causing me some pain and there’d been some changes at the gym that I had to adapt to. \n\nMy partner also works Saturdays (overtime) and after which he would call me. This call comes through at around 8-9pm my time. My partner called me at this time yesterday but I was still at work, no big deal I just assumed he forgot and sent him a message reminding him. He then replies ‘yes but you still could’ve answered’ - which, for the record, unless it was an emergency I really couldn’t have. I have to be on the go the entire time because my managers think 6 hours is plenty of time to do 12 hours worth of work. But he sent the ‘👀’ and ‘what if I was dying’ so I just assumed it was meant to be a joke.\n\nI joked back that if it was an emergency knowing him I wouldn’t have found out until after it happened (which is true, there’s been a couple times where emergencies have happened and I’ve not found out until after they’ve been sorted) and, just in case he was being serious, told him that if it had been any other time I would’ve answered first thing or if he had spammed called me.\n\nHe doesn’t reply to my messages. I get home, call him, but he’s busy so we don’t really do anything. He texts me today saying he still would’ve appreciated if I’d have answered and that he ‘obviously knew I was working’ and that he ‘answers [my] calls when [he’s] working’ (which to my memory I’ve never called him while he’s working so maybe he has a point there) and that he shouldn’t have to spam call me to get through to me in an emergency. I acknowledged his point, apologised, and explained that if I had any inkling that it was an emergency and not just his regular end of day call I would’ve picked up on the first ring no hesitation. He then told me that it wasn’t an emergency and he just wanted to see if I’d answer so he knew who to call if it was, along with the 👍🏻 and 👌🏻 emojis which I thought was a bit petty.\n\nI reminded him that not once have I not answered his call - excluding the times it didn’t connect properly at which point I called him back straight away. And he’s left me on read.\n\nI find myself being angry because he knew this was my first day back at work in two months after surgery, that I needed to adjust to everything and see how the pain levels were on my surgery site, and he decided now was the best time to test me. And not only that he had me feeling guilty for missing an emergency when it wasn’t even an emergency, he just wanted to see if I’d be there for him which, in my opinion, I have been (I was there when he fell off a roof, I was there when his mum tried to off himself, I’ve been there for him and helping with financial issues whenever I could). But on the other hand if he genuinely felt the need to test me on this then I’m worried if I’ve somehow let him down somewhere.\n\nTLDR: partner called me on my first day of work in two months, then when I didn’t answer acted like it was an emergency that I’d missed, then told me it wasn’t an emergency he just wanted to see if I’d answer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Basically, I need help understanding what to do about this guy I've been talking to in Italy.\n\nI'm just about to graduate from my studies, and travel has been the most important goal to me for a few years now. I spent 6 weeks on exchange to Italy when I was 16, and got very close with my exchange sister who stayed in my country for 6 weeks as well. We've stayed in touch ever since.\n\nI revisited her 2 years ago for a week and met all her friends, one of whom is now my penpal. I have always wanted to return to Italy, and maybe live there or visit often from France where I know the language better; but I've had to wait until I finish my studies before I can do anything about it. \n\nI'll call my penpal Joe. I met Joe at a party with my exchange sister where he's part of her friend group. He asked to take me to breakfast the next day after the party, but he cancelled because he was embarrassed about the language barrier. I ended up leaving Italy a few days later. \n\n\nNow, two years later, about a month ago I swiped up on his friends story saying how cute I thought Joe had gotten. He told me to text him and that we would find a way around the language barrier. \n\nI was never too seriously interested, but because I want to come back to Italy I knew I'd want to see him, and it would be nice/fun to have a small connection or an online cultural exchange. \n\n\nWe text every day and send audio messages. He uses ChatGPT to translate and his English without it is pretty basic, but he's trying to learn. I've started learning Italian but I'm making slow progress.\n\nI pour my heart out to him and he asks me all sorts of questions and shares his views. It's become a part of my routine now to wake up excited because I get to see what he's written to me. We've turned up the heat a little on flirting and sharing honestly with each other and it's kinda scaring the shit out of me. We talk about when I come back to Italy and if he could come to Australia or we meet somewhere in the middle. We both say how we wish it would happen sooner but we can't because of schedules and money. \n\nThe thing is: I'm not stupid. I know I'm quite terrified of commitment and romantic relationships despite never staying single for long. This last year I made a commitment to being single and I've been successful. This feels almost like a way for me to dip my toes in knowing it could end at any point or likely go no where - I might find I don't like him as much in person, or the language and cultural barrier is too much. Or the distance becomes unmanageable if neither of us can live in the same cities long term. \n\nI guess I just need to hear people's views on this, and share any stories or guidance they might have if they've been in the same boat. \n\n\nI don't want to get more attached, but I also really like talking to him and get so excited imagining being with him finally. Do I dial it back until I know for sure I can come to Italy, even for a small visit? Do I just keep enjoying this and stop overthinking? \n\nI worry about what it all means and if it even matters. The last time I heard anything like this, it was my Mormon coworker talking to a guy in Brazil and he travelled here and lived with her for a bit. Within the few months he was here she got pregnant with his baby and they're split now - which is a crazy example but it shows this could have real life implications for me. \n\n\nTLDR; I'm getting romantically attached to my cultural exchange penpal despite only texting and sending audio messages and videos and using chatgpt to translate.

I do not plan to ask this from him, because I don’t want to worse the situation, especially as -theoretically - he will be back soon and we can and should discuss this face to face - but I need to ask advice. What would you do in my situation, am I overreacting and overthinking this as well? If not, how should I ask him to not ghost me like this because I suffer from it, without being needy?\nI honestly like to thank for everyone in advance, and I am happy to answer any question.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

It probably seems stupid compared to everyone else's stories on here but we had *the* conversation last night.\n\nOne of her friends are also doing the same thing but she's breaking up with her boyfriend. My girlfriend told me about how her friends expressed their concern for her being \"held back\" because of me and not being able to get the full experience while she's there because we'll still be together. I completely understand where they're coming from considering we've only been official for just under two months and 'talking' since the beginning of June. My girlfriend has also expressed to me that her concern is her libido which, admittedly, is quite high.\n\nShe suggested putting our relationship on pause for a year, but I stood my ground that I wouldn't just wait for her and be no contact for a year. This is because she said that being on pause would entail still talking everyday and basically being in a relationship but not calling it one for the sake of having physical connections with other people and having it not being labeled cheating. We've talked about opening the relationship up under the conditions that she tells me and checks if I'm okay with it, she discloses it with any partner she has, she only does engage in physical intimacy with the same person as a one night stand with no possibilities for reaching out, and she only does so when she is at the extreme breaking point of sexual needs. I just don't know if that's the right choice but it was the only thing I could do to not break up immediately. We've already clarified that it's not some excuse to just cheat on me but it's purely for sexual needs.\n\nI'm not going to engage in any sexual activity because I'm the type of person where strings are attached to it and my libido is also way lower than hers but I'm not going to ask her to abstain for a year. We still love each other and can very easily picture a long term relationship together but I don't know if I've got rose coloured glasses on and I'm just terrified of losing her so I'm willing to do anything or if this is actually a the best option for us.\n\nPlease help if you can, I've been crying my eyes out since last night.

We have been exploring the idea of meeting in a neutral country that has fewer visa restrictions, making it easier for both of us to travel.\n\nOver the course of our relationship, we have had extensive discussions about our future together, including the possibility of settling down and getting married. However, this journey has been emotionally taxing, particularly due to the time difference between our locations. I have tried to be flexible with my travel plans, but she has faced challenges of her own. She's been held back by the finalization of her divorce paperwork. Although she has been separated from her husband for three years, he has been unwilling to sign the documents necessary to finalize the divorce.\n\nAt this point, I find myself feeling less hopeful about our situation.

(22F/30M)\n\nI (22F, America) am in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (30M, Norway). Just to address the age gap upfront: we’ve had many open, honest conversations about it, and both of us (as well as my family and friends) are comfortable with the difference. This also isn’t my first long-distance relationship, so I knew what I was signing up for.\n\nI love my boyfriend with all my heart. We recently had our first in-person visit where I stayed with him in Norway for 9 days. While we spent time sightseeing and enjoying being together, we also treated it as a trial run of living under the same roof. By the end, we had a long conversation confirming that we *could* see ourselves living together in the future. Our long-term goal is for me to eventually move in with him once our finances are stable.\n\nWe already talk and hang out online nearly every day, so it’s not like we aren't close. But, ever since that visit, I’ve been feeling especially lovesick. I find myself constantly aching to be with him in person again, and endlessly think about my next trip. Sometimes the feelings get so overwhelming that I even have intrusive thoughts about just \"running away” on a 90-day visitor visa, even though I know that’s not realistic or healthy. (For anyone wondering why he doesn’t visit me here in America, I have a strong personal dislike for America, and I’d rather put in the time and money to see him in Norway instead.)\n\nI also want to clarify: my boyfriend truly loves and cares for me, even if he’s not as outwardly emotional about the distance. He’s neurodivergent and struggles with empathy, while I’m very sensitive and empathetic, so I feel the strain more intensely than he does. He shows his love in steady ways, and we’re both committed to the same future together.\n\nSo my question is: for anyone who’s been in this position, how do you cope with the constant longing and lovesickness without letting it spill into work and daily life? Do you have routines or rituals that help soften the ache between visits? And how do you balance being present in your own life while still nurturing the relationship? While I do have my own hobbies and other friends and am not strictly dependant on my boyfriend's presence to be happy, I feel the longing hit especially hard while I am at work.\n\nAny advice, tips, or even shared experiences would mean a lot.

We're both 18 and he's getting his final year this year and i'm getting a job. However, even when i'm in colege which i have 10 hours outside at school (not including the 2 hours of traffic back home) and he only gets 5 to 8 hours (home by 3pm), i always want to call him first thing as i get home, even if i have to study while in call, that's what i wish to do. But he goes to sleep as soon as he gets home from school, and when he wakes up, time for gaming and friends, not me. I (F18) overthink a lot because i struggle with high cortisol production and overall just hypersensitivity (and yes i've tried medication and therapy and so far it was a temporary fix only), which makes me very clingy to him and sometimes hurt when i get little to no time to even text eachother. We met 2 times in 2 years, IRL i'm the priority, he goes out of his ways for me, he takes me to visit stuff even tho he hates museums but he knows i love it, he ignores all screen unless its to watch something with me, he wants to cuddle all the time and is overall very affectionate verbally and physically. However, in texts or calls, he rarely calls me, when he's on he's always playing games wanting to listen to music or playing with his friends (including females), otherwise he's sleeping. He often tells me he cant call me because he woint get time during the day or week but i see him in a group call playing with friends as soon as he says that, and yes, he tells me he's going to play with them because i've already comlained about how he used to not tell me when he goes to play while i'm waiting all day for him to pay attention to me.. We call like maybe once a week or something. WHich pains me, i'm a very clingy person but he is often busy with school, friends or asleep, otherwise yes he texts me a lot and also expresses that he loves me and calls me pet names but it feels dry and distant compared to how loving he was irl. It really pains me, i know i'd love to see him play irl because we're both gaming nerds and i have no issues with that, i just wish he'd play while in call with me and spend time even 5 min with me instead of his friends being his first pick when he gets time.\n\nI dont know what to do, i have no friends except my little sister, and i'm trying to make friends but they often disappear before i even get to spend more time with them. I tried multiple games to spend time alone but being lonely for multiple days is painful. I want to help myself be less dependent of him, or do something to help him with his time but i dont want to cause any argument over it.

That if there is love, we can do everything!\n\n\n to sum it up it’s over 2years already, last year he suggested the plan for me to invite me to Italy but then he suddenly goes unreachable and inconsisten so I can’t communicate with him well, then until I get frustrated and mad at him about that because it feels like I don’t know where he’s leading me so I communicated to him about that, I expressed my frustrations. And ended it up, I told him one last chance, if nothing is going well then it’s done, I decided out of frustration, anger and and pain with my emotions, plus my uncle died way back home so I can’t fully grieve about what’s going on inside me and my surroundings. It was a bit easier for mo to move past on those months after may, till October. Full of his silence. He told me he can do I better.. but then he didn’t do anything on those  months, so I thought we’re done truly. I cried and prayed every night but I still feel unsettled with it, October came and then he reach out h\nWith a hey how are you, then later called me and saying I’m sorry can you forgive me.. I thought about it for few days and then he reach out again and then allowed him back again with saying promised me you won’t disappear this time and don’t do like you did, and show up, I needed your presence, actions not just words and he agreed, , he told me he arranged his travel to meet me last March 2025 but few days before March ends he called and I asked him why aren’t you coming as you said  and he told me, that’s what I want to tell you that I cannot come because I went with my family trip, so I get frustrated with that and he promised me to move that plan to October. On the May 2025;  I suddenly felt something weird and tried to reach him out, we had a good shot of communication last April then May felt something weird on my, I saw a post of him on Instagram with his Thailand trip, I felt hurt because he was able to travel to Thailand but not in Hongkong as I am here, I felt jealous because I saw a back of a girl, a hand of a girl on some of his photos and told me it’s two different girls a, one is a friend and one is his tour guide, but dinning in a Michelin restaurant with a friend or tour guide? That’s make s me feels wired and hurt, after that I asked him about him. He tried to explain his part and tried to make me regulate. But later when I tried to comment on the photo with emoji 🤨 removed me as his instagram follower so then I can’t see his post, I asked him he said, because we fought about the girl photos and that I’m getting obsessed with the girl even if he explain already. And that this is for my peace he doesn’t want me to keep thinking about it. I thought about it, I said maybe he\nIs intentions was true and reasons was genuine. We made up. \n\n\nEnd of July we talked and told me he was not able to come up with the plan on October to meet as he change it agin du\nNeto reason he can’t because this time his dad is going to finally have the knee surgery, and he need to come with him and he will accompany his dad, I felt frustrated again because as you know he can’t come up with the plan and promise that he said, but again he promised me he will come by March 2026, and he assured me he will come even if I will say I won’t wait.

So I’ll start with me, I’m 14 (almost 15), and earlier on this year I had gotten myself into a relationship that hasn’t ended well at all. My girlfriend, who I haven’t met before, but is exactly my perfect type, (it’s in the looks, the personality, the voice, and that I find most girls from the USA so damn hot) has loved me for a while. She is extremely happy about the relationship (or well, was) and would always call and text me whenever she could. Until the 9th or August I believe, when her parents forced her to block me. Now she struggles bad with her mental health, and I knew this could mean that without being there to comfort her her, she could spiral really fast. And that was exactly what I didn’t want. In the text she talked about how her parents went through her phone and found out about us and that she had to block me. For the time that I was blocked, I was worried sick, and luckily she came back around less than a week later because she was being a lil sneaky thing and snuck behind her parents back to talk to me. We were both crying and at that point I was depressed and wouldn’t speak to anyone or do anything u enjoyed for the time I had lost her. And blah blah blah I don’t think anyone really needs to know about anything UNTIL.. It happened again.\n\nHer parents went through her phone and found out about us again. Luckily my girlfriend told me it was going to happen and gave me some details to work with to get her back. She isn’t allowed to have her phone for a whole year, or date anyone at all until 21 or possibly if she moved out and her parents were feeling generous (which they never are, those evil bastards). We used to call on discord a lot because we both played games on our PC and we enjoyed the screen sharing part, that wasn’t were we mainly called though, we talked on Snap, TikTok, and iMessages too.\n\nWhat I do know currently: \n- She doesn’t have access to her phone for a year\n- She has blocked me on every social\n- I know her full name and address\n- And weirdly enough, through the use of an alt Snapchat account, I found out that she has been online in the last 24 hours\n- She normally uses her phone after she has woken up (around 12-2pm EST), so any contact would have to be attempted after or around that time.\n\nSo loosing her again basically destroyed me, I thought about suicide and have been for this week, I’ve tried suicide prevention services, and I’ve talked to close friends. But it never seems to be enough, I feel like I have a void inside deep inside of me that is ripping me apart day by day. I did send her voice-memos despite being blocked on iMessages because I thought there would be a possibility that she would see them in the future. And I have been blocked one of my alt Snapchat accounts, as of now, my second alt hasn’t been blocked. \n\nNow I am basically venting about it here on Reddit, because I loved her and she is now 1 of 3 people I have lost contact with in sad ways (whether that be suicide or abusive parenting),but I’m also asking for any help or advice regarding getting her back. I will try near to anything to get her back, it’s messing with my mental health, education, and overall mood throughout the day. But for now I’ll leave this post to sit and  probably leave it here.

Our sex life took a pause and started back up when it went away. We creatively found time for each other by leaving the children with her mom overnight and going to hotel. Grandma had a sleepover and so did we…\n\nOut of 15 days I was there, I only had her all to myself for the last four. After the kids were back in school, it was like a weight was lifted off our shoulders. There was no more responsibilities there was no more holding back. We really do have an amazing physical relationship. It’s so powerful and loving and beautiful. I miss her so much.\n\nI was married before and I have two children. I could remember the moment of conception on both instances. I shit you not. I had one of those moments with my wife and I remember instantaneously thinking. What the fuck just happened? \n\nThe two of us talk about it all the time and say we definitely wanna have a child with each other. We both agreed not in the middle of this immigration journey.

The trip went perfectly: we laughed, traveled, shared a lot of romance, and had no issues at all. But on the last day, just before she had to leave, she suddenly broke up with me. She told me I was the perfect guy, but that she wasn’t ready for another relationship, even though she wanted to be.

But as soon as she landed back home, she called me crying, saying she didn’t mean to break up and kept spamming me with messages.

Tbh we dont know nothing really about each other i only know he has a daughter and bla bla… Ok, but ngl… he is horny 24/7 and talks about norhing. If i talk about any topic he turns everything in sexual way like jeez im so tired. He also is someone who told me my exes treated me bad and he would never do the nudes things, but comes out, he is saying after we had arguments via online that my exes treated me right and no wonder they despited me etc. and he really overdo it w nudes. Once i also accidentally mentioned marriage and he said he is divorced but she didnt signed it so actually he is still married lol. And she will never sign it he said. Means he wouldnt be even able to ever marry me. Also, prob this child which he already has, is already enough for him… dunno. I cant have a normal convo w him cus yh… he ignors and rather sends his dick.\n\nIm often think about my 1st ex… he was so genuine…🥹\n\nI to be honest am so depressive , i am on antidepressants, i just feel like, i dont wanna waste my time. I wanna build a family, marry once, have a good job.

I’m considering getting a divorce.\n\nMy husband and I are a long distance couple, we met here on Reddit while being in different countries and our relationship has mostly transpired at a distance (continents and time zones away). We have been together for almost two years and decided to get married two months ago.\n\nRecently, he came to the country I’m currently residing in for two weeks. Everything was ok, we had some disagreements but we worked through them. He’s always been the most patient and sweetest man to me. Since yesterday night was his last night here and I know how much he wanted to play board games and socialize, I invited the classmates from my postgrad program to my shared apartment to play games and drink.\n\nMy husband began drinking immediately and by the end of the night he had basically drank about 70% of all the alcohol by himself. I have seen him drink and hold his alcohol before so I trusted he knew his limits. However, last night I saw a version of him I have never seen and it has truly scared me. \n\nHe began being loud and slurring, then he said he wanted to go to a bar but since my friends were leaving and his flight requires us to be up early in the morning, I told him I don’t think it was happening. At around this time, one of my friends who had already left called me terrified and told me that a guy had followed her and was harassing her and that she’ll send me her location because she was extremely scared. I told her ok and offered to send a taxi if she needed for her to come back here but she said it was ok and a girl she saw on the street was helping her get home. \n\nI began putting away and cleaning the mess in the apartment while checking my friend’s live location. At this time, I noticed my husband putting on his shoes. I intercepted him at the door and asked where he was going and he said to the bar and I asked him if he was going alone and he asked if I to come with to which I replied no because we have to be up early tomorrow and he hadn’t even taken the keys and it’s dangerous to go out at this time. Then he went back into my bedroom while I cleaned and I thought everything would be ok, but then I saw him head out. After realizing it was too quiet while I tidied up I realized he had left the apartment completely. Soon after, he called me and was being incoherent so I asked him where he was and why he left. At this point I began crying because he had taken the only set of keys I had and I felt terrified of going out to search for him alone without my keys (without a way to return home if I was in danger, especially after what my friend had told me had happened to her).\n\nHe continued being incoherent and this went as a back and forth when he didn’t want to tell me where he was or was too drunk to. He kept hanging up and while that was happening I was also getting updates from my friend so I missed a couple of his calls. I called him back once more and he asked me WHAT DO YOU WANT? So I hung up. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to do, I called one of my classmates who also lives in this building and asked her for her keys because I wanted to go out looking for my husband. I was terrified for him because he had taken his phone, wallet and passport with him as well as the keys. Without hesitation, she and another classmate came over and offered to go out with me to search for him. \n\nThe three of us went out and sure enough there were guys in the street who catcalled and tried talking to us, we ignored them but honestly I felt extremely grateful for them being there with me in this situation. I was on the phone with my husband trying to get him to describe where he was but he was truly not making sense at all and I began to get frustrated, so one of my classmates offered to take the phone from me and try talking to him. She did and after walking for around 15 minutes we saw him stumbling in the middle of the street. We went to him and he immediately collapsed on the floor. \n\nHe laid there for a while, while we tried to wake him up and put him on his side. One of my friends went to get a glass of water and at this time a few passerbys had stopped to ask if everything was ok since it was a weird scene I guess: three women trying to move a guy on his side in the middle of the sidewalk at midnight on a weekday. We managed to get him awake and sitting up and tried giving him the water but he kept spitting it, so then we tried to get him up and moving towards the apartment building. My classmates were incredible, they helped hoist him up and pull him and help him walk (he was mostly shuffling while we carried his weight).\n\nDuring this time, he kept asking my friends where they were from and trying to talk to people on the street. He asked a group of guys if they had penises and also tried to talk to a homeless guy who was on the floor. We kept trying to keep him from engaging with people because he was being obnoxious. Then, he kept talking loudly to one of my classmates, he stopped and tried to grab her wrists while talking loudly to her. I saw her get visibly uncomfortable and I stepped in and told him hey please stop trying to grab her, don’t grab her like that. He looked at me and asked if I was mad and I just told him let’s keep walking. He then pushed me, not too hard but I did stumble. My friends told him not to be mean to me like that because I’m just worried for him and we’re just trying to get him home. He then said hey (my name) fuck off. It took every bit of me not to cry at that moment. I was already feeling extremely embarrassed about how he had been acting and about him trying to grab my friend and screaming at people in the street, but this was too much. \n\nWe continued walking and he screamed his head off on the way, shouting incoherent things. As we approached the building where I live, my husband suddenly took off running and we had to run after him, then he tried to pee at the door of the building and I had to stop him. There were police near the building and I wanted to avoid him getting arrested. We got him inside the building and he collapsed in the lobby in front of the elevators. We got him up and moving and then when we reached our floor he ran again towards the very end of the hall and again tried to pee. Again I had to run after him and literally shove his zipper back up again. I got him to the apartment and he entered my room and closed the door. I was left to thank my friends and say goodbye.\n\nI was afraid of what I would find in my room, but when I got in he was just passed out on my bed snoring. He briefly lifted his head when he sat me enter and said you don’t care about me. I hid behind my closet and sobbed for a few minutes wondering what the hell did I get myself into. This has been one of the most embarrassing and stressful experiences of my entire life. I can’t stop thinking that if it hadn’t been for my friends, I would probably still be out there without a key and a means to come home, exposed to who know what dangers, roaming the streets of the city searching for this man. I am terrified. \n\nI have to mention I also just underwent an invasive medical procedure which required me to not do physically exerting activities for a week or two and he knew this and still he had no qualms putting me in this situation. I have realized through this and other situations that this man doesn’t have any regard or compassion towards me at all. When he woke up after throwing up all over my floor, he dismissed what he did and said it was all easily solvable. He watched me almost puke all over myself while cleaning his disgusting puke off my floor. Yesterday night I didn’t sleep at all because of this and I felt the cramping this has caused on the area I was operated on throughout the day. I don’t think he understands how deeply this has altered the image I had of him, he is exactly like my father used to be with my mother and and that terrifies me. I am seriously considering getting a divorce soon.

Our communication has been less open, and I've felt like I'm doing all the \"right things\" in the relationship based on what she's said in the past, but it's not leading to a closer connection. I’ve been feeling frustrated and, honestly, a bit suffocated. I felt bad that she couldn’t openly express her feelings, and conversations often turned into arguments.\n\nLast night, in a moment of frustration, I sent her a long text message expressing this. I was trying to communicate that I feel like she's not being as open or direct with her own feelings, and it's making me feel stuck.\n\nHere is the exact message I sent her (translated from Hindi to English):\n\n>This is why it feels even more suffocating, that I'm doing everything you're telling me to, but still, distance keeps growing. You can't openly express what you are feeling, and then I get angry not at you but at myself. What exactly should I do, so that you can openly express what you are feeling? If you're missing me, then say you're missing me. Or if you're feeling love, say 'I love you.' Give the order openly without blaming, 'be a child'\n\nAnd this was her complete response:\n\n>This is your problem which you are imposing on me... Your unemotional unavailability and suppression is leading to this. But you don't want to address this.\n\nI was completely taken aback by her response. My intention was to open up and ask for more open communication from her, but she immediately turned it around and said it was my fault, calling me \"unemotionally unavailable.\"\n\nWhile I don't feel like I was blaming her, I can see how my frustration might have come across that way. Maybe she's right about my own issues\n\nI want to solve this. I don't want to lose her over a text message, but I also don't know how to move forward.\n\n**My questions for you are:**\n\n1. How should I respond to her message now? What is the best next step to de-escalate and show I want to understand?\n2. How can I address her point about my \"unemotional unavailability\"? Is this a common thing in relationships, and what does it even mean in a practical sense?\n3. What's a healthy way to have this conversation in person?

Since then things haven’t really been the same. \n\nAlmost every week we have arguments about the fact that he thinks i’m insecure because he doesn’t tell me when he’s going to do things. He’ll promise me he’ll go online and play games with me and then it’s hours before I hear from him. He tells me he loves me every night, and that he wants to be on the phone to go to bed. \n\nRecently he had a court case where his bosses gf represented him, afterwards they decided to hangout and he didn’t tell me until I asked what he was doing. When he told me that they were hanging out I told him I wasn’t comfortable with it and they still went on a walk on a (in his words) “public trail in the woods”. When I looked at his Life360 it showed him at her house for 22 mins and then he said she went back to his (and her bfs) house and THEN went for a walk.\n\nThe last day or two it’s been tense and I tried talking to him about it but he got upset and it turned into an argument. I’m not sure what to do because I love him so much and I don’t want to lose him, but right now I just don’t know how to go about this. \n\nTonight he seemed irritated so I asked if he would like a night without a facetime for bed and he said “Yeah, I guess” so I hung up. Two hours later I called and said I really couldn’t sleep without him and he said “You were the one who asked for it”, which I wasn’t doing.

Her friends all know she is with me, so it's hurtful when communication has to change and she treats me differently around other people. There's no \"I love you\" except for bedtime and no words of affection or flirting almost like I really don't even exist. (Whereas when I see my friends or have events, I always message her and make sure I tell her I miss her, I wished she was with me)\n\nI have tried to maintain normal conversation and ask her about her day, how she is, but she barely answers any questions. When I have commented on her outfits and called her beautiful she has also ignored this and simply said what she was doing. Now, she has turned to posting stories with cryptic messages. From a song about \"Being A Fool\" in love, missing chances, to another song about \"Words\" where the singer says they can't express their love through words, but you need to believe it through their song. I tried to ask her if she was okay, since she's been silent. She told me she's fine and was at the beach. I said her communication seemed a little different and asked if she was sure, she then asked me \"What do you expect anyway?\" and proceeded to talk about how she's going to eat now. I apologized and said I didn't know it was the wrong time for talking. She thanked me and left it at that.\n\nShe messaged me two hours later to tell me she's going showering. I asked about her plans and she told me she's going to go spend her evening with her female friends watching the sun. I felt heartbroken because to me this is an activity I would do with my partner. When we meet up in person she never plans anything romantic, it's always physical. When we did have a chance to go on a boat I tried to talk to her, but she was on her phone. I asked if she had any questions for me, she said she already knew me and \"Ruined\" the romantic evening by texting her friends 24/7 then taking photos. I asked her to dance with me but she refused. (This hurt me because she sings and dances with friends, but when I asked her in public, she refused. I had to dance with someone else when I got called up. Everything made me feel lonely. I felt like a stranger in her country.\n\nNow, she's on vacation, so I didn't tell her the sunset viewing bothered me, I simply.. wished her and her friends a good time. But a part of me hurt me. I don't want to be controlling or tell someone what they should/shouldn't do - but I also feel she should understand that the LDR is hard for me, I want to talk to my person, not feel like a complete stranger or last priority. She doesn't need to update me every two or three hours, she could just talk to me properly in the evening rather than shutting me out completely or giving surface level responses.\n\nAIO or am I right to feel neglected/unloved during such situations?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She should have stayed for about a month, but after the second date she had to cut her trip short and fly home. I thought it was unlucky, because she intrigued me and I'd have liked to have more dates her. While she was on the plane, we kept messaging, and she told me I was totally her type. I admitted I felt the same about her.

I’m gonna go by Doe (19M) and let’s call her JB (18F).\n\nWe’ve been together for a year. We’ve had some arguments, but usually we talk them out and make up. On Monday, though, she broke up with me. We had already been on a 3-week break after an earlier incident. I’ll explain.\n\nI’ve had other relationships before, but this one felt different and real. We met in person around 6–7 times. First time was at her aunt and uncle’s house. Second time, we split an Airbnb half-and-half — cooking, watching movies, going to the park, late-night drives, sleeping together, smoking, holding hands. We were so close. I even went to her prom as her date and we took tons of photos.\n\nThe first big issue was in June during a school trip in NYC. I was upset at how she spoke to me, so instead of sitting with her and her classmates, I walked away and spoke to her teacher. She cried, left with her friend, and texted that I embarrassed her and wasn’t her boyfriend anymore. That break lasted about a week and a half. I apologised, promised it wouldn’t happen again, and started therapy. She told me I needed to mature, and I tried.\n\nIn August, we reunited at another Airbnb. She hugged and kissed me when I arrived, and the trip was great. Cheesecake Factory, the park, the beach, seafood boil, her favourite diner — we cried when saying goodbye at the bus station.\n\nBut later in August 26, I argued with my roommate and called JB for advice. While screen-sharing, she asked what sites I’d been on. I admitted I had watched one explicit instructional video before our trip — literally one video on how to please her. I showed her my history to prove it, but she was disgusted and said I betrayed her. I apologised many times, surprised her with her favourite foods and coffee, wrote long messages about how much I loved her.\n\nShe kept saying she needed space. It hurt, since we’re long-distance. She sometimes told me she still loved me, which confused me. I gave her a few days, but after three weeks I finally asked where we stood. I reminded her of everything we’d been through, even how she once told me I was her safe place after her emotional support cat was sold.\n\nShe told me she cries herself to sleep and misses me, but doesn’t think she wants a relationship right now. She said she needs to focus on herself after graduation. That broke my heart. She also said the NYC incident is still stuck with her, even though I’ve been working to change. She claimed our serious talks drained her, and she didn’t want couple counselling or weekly check-ins.\n\nI felt like she was weaponising the past against me; she said I was manipulating her. We argued, and later I had a panic attack, collapsed, and ended up in the hospital for a day. I told her, and she was worried, but even before that she had said she didn’t want to date anyone right now — maybe in the future we could reconnect.\n\nWhat confuses me is that when we first met, she pressured me to ask her out, and I resisted because of past heartbreak. She was the first person I could cry to in years. Now I feel like my time was wasted.\n\nWe still share our locations on Life360, but I don’t know what to do at this point.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I asked why and he said he’s feeling more then one emotion, I said okay, he then said he’s gonna shower and sleep and then goodnight and has been offline since, I tried calling him because i’m on the verge of tears and I feel like he’s in the wrong here but no pick up, he’s probably asleep so I won’t hear from him for the next 8 hours (we have a very big time distance, i’m in the UK he’s in NZ, i’m on a gap year). \n\nIf we were staying long distance at this point I think i’d break up with him but I really love him and I know we’re better in person, and I want to give that a shot when i’m home, but if we’re both hurting and both hurting each other and fighting every 3 days with both of us struggling mentally already I don’t know how we’re supposed to get through the next 3.5 months without starting to hate each other.

I’m pessimistic by nature, but I can’t help but wonder… is there even a point in trying to make this work, or am I ignoring the red flags?

We've been able to spend time together in-person twice during the past 7 months, for about a week back in spring here in the US, and then for two weeks in Sweden last month. We had a wonderful time together, and he introduced me to his parents, it went great, they told him how much they liked me, no problems.  \n  \nPretty much as soon as I returned home from Sweden, I started to pick up on this hot-and-cold behavior. It wasn't always this way and I even struggle with wondering if I'm imagining it, because when I have asked him about it, he insists everything is fine and that he is just tired and I should \"just relax\". The trouble is, though, there are overall concrete differences I can point to between recent behavior and what things were like before. For instance, we have always called each other cute goofy pet names in Swedish, especially when saying goodnight, and although I still do this, he rarely reciprocates anymore. He doesn't want to talk on the phone as much (has outright declined to do so a few times when I've asked, even), and doesn't initiate playing video games or watching tv/movies together on the weekends, while previously he was eager to have our phone calls and would be asking me as early as Monday or Tuesday most weeks what I might like to play or watch together in the upcoming weekend. \n\nWe are both introverts and highly value our alone time, but even when we were together for those two weeks last month, we had no problem giving each other that space. He would chill at his PC while I cooked, or sometimes I'd just take a nap, or hang out in the kitchen listening to the radio, drinking my coffee, and reading or crocheting while he did his own thing too, so I don't think it's just post-visit social burnout. \n\nI'm trying to be cool about this and not overthink it, but I've been through relationships in the past where men were not honest with me, and I eventually gaslit myself into believing when they told me I was imagining it, only for everything to come out later and turn my life upside down.

Only a few months into dating, I moved to NYC last year for college and they stayed in our hometown many states away to take community college classes and work because their plans to go to school in Europe fell through. \n\n(Backstory). At one point, they had gotten a job that had room and board -2HRS time zone from me, and it was hell. We barely spoke and if I wanted to have a decent call I would have to stay up till 4am sometimes. Even then, it was like pulling tooth and nail to get them to spend time with me. I tend to be more anxious-attachment style while they’re more of an avoidant-attachment style. It also didn't help that I was trying a new medication for my depression and it was making everything worse. With all of that piling on top of each other, they finally made the switch to morning shift and it was way better. Moving on, that summer I had started working at a sleep-away summer camp and they moved back home from their job in the middle of the summer. The pattern of being distant and having to fight for them to talk to me started back up again, and it did that again when I moved back for college. I had another talk with them about how it felt like I was on a rollercoaster of us spending time with each other to no time at all, and my battle with wanting to stay together because I love them but that I wasn’t getting my relationship needs met. We discussed taking a break or breaking up, but neither of us wanted to do either. So we’re still working on things but it’s currently on an up.\n\nOnto how I’m feeling currently. I’m very proud of them and excited for uni to begin but I can’t help but feel nervous. Specifically, I'm the most nervous about us being so far away from each other, the time change, and how I'm worried they'll revert back to neglecting me.

I feel very lonely because I actually just moved to a new city, and I feel stuck with my marriage.

It was really great for the first two years. However in this third year the honeymoon phase has for sure ended. I've brought up with her how I miss all the little nicknames, and just general messages. But lately I kind of feel like I'm a chore to her. I've brought this up with her a few times now and she has been very busy with finals and what not. I've done a lot of work and self-reflection, reading up on attachment styles, and making sure that I'm living my own life too. But after about a year of doing this work, it still feels pretty one-sided in the affection department. She's never been in a relationship before, and although I've expressed I like her affection, I think it's hard for her to show. When we're talking it's great and everything is awesome. I can communicate with her about anything, but at the same time I feel like I'm just begging for love at this point. We plan to meet up next year for the first time, it's just getting kind of hard to stick it out when I feel like I'm just a second-thought most of the time, or a chore. I think I might love her more than she loves me. Should I try to communicate this with her again? It would feel like a broken record at this point I think but I also don't know if she's really getting the full picture of how I feel. I love her to death but I also love myself.

It was an awful breakup where we'd unblock each other, edit previous text messages, look at each other's social medias. Obviously we cared for each other but we knew at that point we were awful towards one another and needed to grow but we keep looking back like we still wanted to be at each other's lives. YES A HUGE RED FLAG I KNOW. \n\nIt's been months being \"friends\" and we've been chatting less other than the usual catching up. We're both undergoing therapy and getting the help we need. I'm not saying we're perfect right now as there is still a bit of tension but we're still in contact. None of the petty posts or the editing of messages or deleting of messages.\n\nRight now I'm in a dilemma. Obviously I still love and care for this person. I have no intentions of being in another relationship because ive been focusing on myself and I'm still in love with them. We'd still call each other \"my love\" or send cute messages at times but not ALL the time. Maybe a few days of not talking. The last time we spoke they told me they had no intentions of getting back together with me and just wanted to remain friends. He also said he's not looking for a relationship at all.\n\nI'm fine with that.\n\nBut what's with the pet name calling, and other times we'd even broke to say I love you. I don't know it's night time right now and I'm overthinking things (might've had a bit to drink). He's had history of saying things he don't mean when feelings are overwhelming him which is one of the things he's focusing on bettering himself. \n\nHas any of you ever experienced being friends with an ex and end up dating again in the future when things turn up better? I would also like to ask for advice, maybe on how to continue on being more than \"friends\". Like should I continue inviting them to watch stuffs with me or play games with me. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do. I want to continue being sweet to them and prove that I am doing better. I was an avoidant type because of my trauma which did cause strain in the relationship and now I'm getting better from that but I'm scared I'll keep being sweet and it might turn them off.\n\nBefore you comment I should cut things off we've tried that and broke no contact in two months that's why we remained friends because we just can't be away from each other. It's toxic yes and we should grow seperately but I guess we just can't get away from each other. In a way we can't help caring and looking out for each other.\n\nFor context we're 22.\nWe were together for 8 months and broken up for 4 months.\nThe \"awful break up\" was blocking each other to focus on getting better but we keep editing our last messages sending little notes wondering how the other person is. Even went to the point I posted about being (still) in love and they thought I had a new partner and got upset but I explained it was for them. \n\nYes I know it's red flags everywhere but he's honestly been the best person for me and I'm very much in love with him despite us meeting young.\nI'm a bit of a hopeless romantic and I've been told I'm blinded by my love for them so please be gentle with your comments.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

For most of it, we lived together. But in mid-July, he went back to his hometown, and since then, everything has changed.\n\nThe last time he actually called me was August 4th. After that, for more than a month, there were no calls at all — no video calls, no voice calls, nothing. Because his parents are strict and he’s preparing for government exams, I can’t call him either. But before he left, I had told him very clearly that communication is important to me, especially in a long-distance relationship. Still, nothing changed.\n\nAbout nine days ago, I finally sent him a very long text. I poured out all my feelings, explained how much it hurts, and told him what I wanted in a long-distance relationship. I told him I can’t go days without talking on the phone. He replied with a long paragraph too, assuring me he’d start calling twice a week (normal calls). That gave me hope.\n\nThen Monday came. He texted me asking if he could call, but I was in an online class, so I said, “Can we talk in 30 minutes?” He said it was difficult for him to call and that he would call tomorrow. I agreed.\n\nTuesday — nothing happened. No call, no messages explaining why he couldn’t call. Wednesday passed — nothing. Thursday too — nothing. I waited, but it felt like he wasn’t even trying.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, I couldn’t take it anymore. I sent him a breakup message, saying that this long-distance isn’t working and it’s best to end the relationship. He asked me why, but I just said I didn’t want to go into details. He replied, “Okay.”\n\nThat night, I sent one last message. I told him I was angry, that holding on was hurting me too much, and that I had no choice but to let him go. He just said, “If you’re 100% sure, then okay, I’ll let you go as well.”\n\nI tried not to continue the conversation after that, but I couldn’t help myself. I asked him how he could let me go so easily. He replied that if I was very sure about breaking up, then he had to let me go. He added that maybe when he asked me why I was angry, I should have told him instead of staying vague. He said it wasn’t easy for him either, but honestly, his actions didn’t show that. Even after this, he didn’t try to call me or ask what exactly happened, why I was angry, or why I was breaking up.\n\nHis words were basically: “If you’re 100% sure about the breakup, then I don’t want to force you to stay with me. I have to let you go because asking again won’t change anything.”\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nNow I’m stuck questioning everything. Did I make the right choice? Is this normal? Was I expecting too much, or was he simply not putting in effort?

This happened on a Wednesday in January, I just continued on my way home and nothing else happened. \n\nAfter these days, on Saturday my friend and I decided to go party at a bar, after this and I found this girl at the bar. So since I was drugged I had to go talk to him, it turns out that he is from the United States, the truth is I had never met a foreign person, at least I had never had a long conversation, he told me that he was traveling from California through all of Central America until he arrived here. At least she spoke Spanish because I don't know much English, from that day on I couldn't stop thinking about her and since we added each other on Instagram I decided to talk to you the next day and by the next week we had already gone out, another thing is that I am bisexual and although I knew I had never had a relationship with another woman, she was going to be here for a few weeks, which turned into 4 months and in a matter of 1 month she offered me to live where she was staying, although it was short, it was an absolutely beautiful relationship that came out of nowhere, We had a lot of connection being from such different worlds (in fact she showed me this social network and since she left I decided to use it to see what was happening) (I hope she doesn't see this because it makes her very embarrassed, I know that she usually enters this site, in fact I think she thinks I would never use this, I really liked it a lot) we met and although it was something quite quick, she was a person with whom I had a good connection, we shared ideals and life goals. She wants to travel the world and so do I, the thing is that she had the chance to do it and I have never left my country, it could be considered that I am a poor person here, although I work to get ahead it is quite hard, that is why I am grateful that she invited me to live with her these months, she knew that I had nothing and she helped me just by being together, although I must say that what I had also gave some money to help her, because she is not a person with a lot of money either, just normal. And I study and work, in addition to that with our effort and thanks to the fact that my aunt lives in Bogotá we were able to go there, to some parts of my territory, and we also went to the sea, she invited me because my birthday was coming and I lived in the center of the country so I did not know the sea, it was something so beautiful no one had ever been so special and nice to me, after being in so many relationships where everything was so dry, my love was reciprocated and it made me feel loved, I improved my English, we analyzed life and society, we went to a techno festival, we supported each other when we were super sick and we cried to each other because we knew she had to go, and she did. \n\nIn reality I was quite bad, at least I expressed it all the time, I began to feel anxiety and a lot of sadness just thinking about her leaving (although I always knew it) I think I hurt myself, because I already knew what would happen and I gave myself the opportunity to fall in love, I know it was a very short time, but as I say, I felt very loved, she did things for me that no one had done in any relationship, and it's not that I've had many, but I have had about 4 fairly long relationships, maybe I had only encountered bad guys. So I was bad and we both started to feel anxious and I think the problems began, also a bit of cultural clashes to be honest, stupid things that we started to fight about but we solved it, a lot of emotions and misunderstandings. \n\nThe latter happened in a period of two weeks, we went to the beach and when we returned she could only stay in Colombia for about 3 days where we packed all our things and gave some away, she had been in Colombia for 4 months and in Latin America for about 10 months (I think) so we started packing, I was very anxious we fought, these days we went to the bar where we met, there was not as much good music as that day, and there were few people, we danced like never before and we kissed, we cried, We took pictures, we decided to go through all the places where we spent moments so we could remember it with more nostalgia, we played a little game where we pretended to meet again, the next day we went to eat at a restaurant, we gave each other our last gifts and we cried, she cried too, after almost not seeing her cry and I was the one who did it the most, she did it, we got home, we had our last night together, we didn't fuck, we just talked, to wake up and take her to the airport in the morning, we woke up, our last day together, she played songs on the guitar, we had an alarm for when we had to leave, this alarm went off, this shitty alarm, our time was up, it felt like a stab to my heart previously shattered by life, we said goodbye to a tragic pack at the airport, I cried too much, that same day I had to go to my mother's house with my suitcase after having lived away for some time, heartbroken, I went out drinking with my friends until I waited for her call that she was gone in Los Angeles, and that's where it all ended, 5 months have passed since she left, we still talk and I can't forget her. \n\nSometimes I think that I will never get over her, it's strange, she was only here for 4 months, I've had relationships for years, I thought that this wouldn't affect me and we wouldn't talk again, she's not going to come back, at least she doesn't have a date, she wants to continue saving to be able to tour Latin America since she's a traveler, so I would have to start in Colombia, but I think that now it's difficult to get a job in the United States or something, we don't have a plan, and obviously things have changed, she has her life and I have mine, now I study and work and life is complicated, I have the dream of being an artist so I have to be focused on this, but it is difficult for me, sometimes I feel like I will never get over this. Almost every day I fantasize about her coming back. Since we can get to know each other better, plus we talk almost all the time, I think I'm not as bad as before, but I just don't know how much I can last if I continue with my crazy fantasies, I'll probably never see her again in my life, neither of us have money and the truth is what we did was crazy for love.\n\nTechnically we are now separated, but we still talk every day and tell each other our things, I still lack connection, it's obvious, plus she doesn't know much Spanish, and we are busy but on top of that we talk every day and send each other Instagram reels. \n\n\nI just wanted to vent here, I'm at a good point in my life.

I was surprised, but said yes.\n\nHe explained: she’s in her 30s, shy, classy, successful, and tired of cocky, unavailable men. She wants a family with a loyal gentleman. His wife (a psychiatrist) is her close friend, and they both felt I was the only man they knew who fit her values — genuine, family-minded, tall, funny, reliable. The next day, I had her number.\n\nI opened politely, and she replied warmly. Now, 3 weeks in, we’ve exchanged \\~800 texts and had several hour-long video calls. Conversation moved from polite basics → personal → lightly flirty.\n\nShe works in medicine, runs a private clinic, comes from old money, studied at top universities.

She’s gorgeous, and we share humor, goals, interests, values, even Zodiac (which matters not so much to me, but it does to her).\n\nThe challenge: distance.

He (M23) broke up with me (F21) yesterday through text. We were together for 2 1/2 years and saw each other 2 times during the relationship. I flew to Switzerland to see him for the first time in May and it was so perfect. I saw him again in July, but it was only for a few days since we had scheduling problems due to work. For the past month, I felt distant from him because it felt as if he would choose to be with his friends over texting and calling me. I was never against him being with his friends, I just wanted to feel like a priority to him again. We usually call every day, but we haven’t called since Friday because his friend was staying with him for a few days. During the same weekend, I found out my dad had to go back to the hospital, so I‘ve been very anxious and badly needed support from him. I told him the news, but he was unable to call me since his friend was always with him. He checked in on me through text on Tuesday and everything felt fine, he even said he loved me and gave me support. Then, on Wednesday I noticed he unfollowed and removed me as a follower on all my instagram accounts. With how bad my anxiety has been, this made me feel like spiraling. I messaged him questioning if I did anything, what happened, etc. He never responded until the next day. When he got home from work I tried to call him many times, but he kept declining immediately. He finally told me he was calling his mom, then proceeded to send a very long breakup message. He said he has felt unsure ever since the July visit because he felt as if the distance was too hard to keep up with. This unsure thought was always in his mind for the past 2 months apparently. He always said he wanted to move to America with me even though I told him I was open to going anywhere. He said he still loves me and would’ve worked it out if we were in the same place. After, he ended up saying that he feels like he’s too young to leave Switzerland now that he has gotten closer to his friends there this year and wants to be with family. I kept insisting for him to answer my calls so we can have a proper chat, but he kept refusing since he wanted everything to end now. I understand long distance is hard, but he had never expressed the struggle he felt about it to me. Eventually, he ended the conversation and blocked me on everything. I‘m so heartbroken because I did nothing wrong and we both spoke often about our future plans. The past month we were planning his first visit to me in November for my birthday. It feels as if my world is falling apart as I‘m very sentimental. He is the very first guy I‘ve ever told my family about. I can’t bring myself to delete any memories or things that we have gotten each other. I desperately want him to come back to me because he is my very first love. I feel like I didn’t have enough time to process my thoughts and what I wanted to say before he blocked me. All I wanted was a final call during the moment. I want him to come back soon, so I can talk this out with him.

Everything has been great but there is this one problem or two I guess. But just a little bit of summary, the way that I have been brought up its not okay for us to drink or smoke often. I have seen my dad and mom drinking but it's very rarely like about once in 3 months or so. Now my boyfriend since he moved out of his house to college he has been drinking very regularly, it started with drinking once a month to now drinking every weekend. \n\nNow it's been two years, he has completed his college and now is working but the pattern still is going on. We've had multiple fights over it and we always try to come to a middle ground of he shouldn't drink more than once or twice a month but he never follows through. Also one other issue is, we've been in a long distance relationship for 3.5 years now and since he started working (since last 6 months) our fight have increased. The other reason for our fight is I feel he doesn't give me enough time. So we both are working individual and also are in different time zones. I do not have a lot of life or friends or actually I DON'T have any life or friends at all where I live so he's my only source of support and my only friendship that I have. \n\nNow as I mentioned we both work so we only get weekends to ourselves to talk but he chooses to be with his friends during all the weekends. The first month of his job was hell for us because he kept going out with his friends and drinking every weekend and we kept fighting. Then he had to go to another city for training for the coming 4 months and that's when we got to spend time with each other every weekend, I was always there for him and everything. Our relationship was really good. Drinking didn't go down though it was the same (but that wasn't his fault I guess) but he had stopped smoking completely.\n\nAnyways. So those 4 months were great but now he's back in the city where he has his friends and now it's back to the routine so I spend my weekends waiting for him to get free and then we talk. He does come eventually after all his plans are over and might cancel one or two plans of his so we sit together but it's rare so I know that it's not like he isn't trying at all. Plus I do understand that he's living away from home and weekends are the only time he gets to chill with his friends and all so I understand that I can't expect him to lock himself in a room and spend his weekend evenings with me but I dont know. Also the smoking and drinking has again become regular. We have had MULTIPLE fights, mature talks and everything about all of it and each of it has ended with a truce of him understanding where I am coming from and that he will change. His issue is he doesn't want someone to control his actions and he gets triggered by that. \n\nSo now we are moving closer to getting engaged and getting our families involved and it's worrying me as to is this what my life is gonna look like? \n\nHe's the most kindest the most loving the most attentive person. Whenever we're together he treats me like a princess and I know he's loves me a lot. I don't doubt that for a bit. He always supports me he always is there to pick me up when I fall he knows what makes me laugh he always motivates me he takes care of me more than my parents does. So all of that is great.\n\nBut these issues keep coming up and am tired. As I said I don't have any friends I can talk about it too and I don't want to involve my brother into this cause like I said we are soon to get engaged and I don't want him to have a bad impression of him.\n\nI haven't used reddit much but I am looking for any kind of advice or perspective or anything that worked out for someone who went through this.\n\nThank you.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Honestly, our relationship has been pretty close to perfect. I’ve been in toxic relationships before, and he’s the complete opposite of anything I’ve known. I'm super close with his family and they treat me so lovely compared to mine own. We communicate well, we make time for each other, and while we do have the occasional disagreement, we always resolve it the same day and never let resentment build up.\n\nAbout a year ago, we took a big step and moved to a different state together. And while we’re living in a tiny, not-so-great apartment, I’ve never been happier doing life with him.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky: a few weeks ago, his company unfortunately shut down. While he’s not too stressed about finding work again, he has plenty of opportunities, it turns out he might be getting an offer from a major company in the U.S. If that happens, he’d likely need to move there (we are from AUS)\n\nI’m genuinely so proud and excited for him, but at the same time, I have no idea what this means for *us*. We’ve talked and cried about it (both of us in tearS) and we’re just at a loss. We love each other deeply, but this is such a huge, life-altering decision.\n\nI would never stop him from chasing his dreams, and I do believe we could make long distance work if we really tried. I don’t know anything about visas or how that process would even work, but I imagine we could figure it out over time as well. That said, there’s also the fear: what if I eventually move over there and things don’t work out? What if we put so much into this and it still falls apart?\n\nI’m also still in the early stages of my career compared to him, which makes everything feel even more uncertain. I don’t blame him for being confused, so am I. But not having a clear answer on where we stand or what we’re doing really hurts. I feel like I’m stuck in limbo, waiting.\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated (please be kind).\n\n**P.S.** I know I’m young and that if this relationship didn’t work out, I’d eventually find love again. But this *does* work. We’ve always said that if something ever tore us apart, it would never be because of how we treat each other rather it would be because of our careers.

How do we work this out?\n\n\nWe’re in a long-distance relationship (I’m from Europe, he’s from the US). His dad is Hindu and doesn’t eat beef, so his mom doesn’t either out of respect. My boyfriend is Hindu too, but he has eaten beef before—though his dad doesn’t know, and he’d never tell him.\n\nI wasn’t raised religiously—my parents are basically atheists. I believe in God, right and wrong, and a bit in karma, but nothing strict.\n\nOur issue is about the future and raising kids. I don’t want to raise them with any strict religion, just to be good people. He wants to raise them Hindu. He doesn’t mind if I eat beef, but he doesn’t want it cooked in our house or served to our future kids. I understand his perspective, but it bothers me since it’s not my religion, and I want our home to feel like ours. It’s not my belief so I’d like to cook it occasionally for myself if it’s my home too.\n\nWhat confuses me is that he still eats beef occasionally (and likes it), but feels guilty because of his religion and parents (his dad). I don’t want our kids growing up with that same guilt. We agreed they won’t eat beef when they’re little and can decide for themselves later, but I worry his parents will interfere and cause drama. I feel like it should be our decision as a couple, not influenced by his family, and I wish he’d stand up more for that. So that’s mainly it. He is already worried about them finding out that our kids will maybe decide to eat beef later on and his dad could assume that he does too, which would lead to a huge argument. \n\nSo yes, that’s the main issue. I don’t like how he is already scared that if our future kids end up eating beef, his parents will find out. cause then his dad will assume that he eats it too (which is technically true) and there’s gonna be a huge drama. I just don’t want to live like that, hiding it just because of his parents. This is our life and it’s gonna be our little family and I think it’s none our both our parents’ business, only ours. Even if that sounds harsh.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or has anyone been in a situation like this? Also, I know I’m pretty young and he is too.

Like shouldnt I want to talk to them everyday? They have been busy ppl so a lot of them cant talk everyday. But im sure that makes them feel unwanted. Idk. Maybe it was their first LDR. But is this me not having complete interest? I get invested and feel like the distance creates a bond. But i know that not b the case on their end. I loved the 1st and the 3rd and the 2nd I was okay with the seperation. I dont want this cycle to repeat.

I give a lot to myself to the mental state of the LDR but maybe dont really get to know my partner. I think for the latter it was because she always wasnt sure because LDR wasnt for her and I was afraid of losing her. So I just preserved the false peace we had and it broke in our last discussion. She triggered a really deep wound and I made some mistakes becuase I had slept only 2-3 hrs per day when we were talking that 3 day stretch. conversely i triggered her trauma from for ex but I was respectful, just said it in a sharp tone. no bad words. I felt we could have grown from it. I have 5 weeks of no contact. its been 3.5 weeks since she blocked me after for a total of 8.5 weeks since the fight and 13 ish weeks since the initial pre breakup Idk. i wasnt there for her when her dad passed away, I was initially and then 2.5 weeks later she gets mad at overcrossing her boundaries w/o explanation and breaks up with me. Why couldnt i have the emotional maturity to ignore the break up and focus on her. I really didnt want to lose her. and so I crried a lot in front of her. she is the only one whos ever seen me like that. but maybe she lost respect for the lack of masculinity. i was just being real. She wanted someone that would lead her and said I was a child at heart. So is this due to our differences? Idk. I still love her.

I live in Italy and my partner lives in South Africa, we've been dating for 4 years online but we've been lucky enough to to be able to meet many times for long periods thanks to tourist visas and my supportive family. My partner would like to move here but it's proving almost impossible, she was able to study here for a year, and then come by on a tourist visa every few months.\n\nWe attempted to get her to live with me legally, we had every document ready and submitted but a police visit needed to check that she actually resides with me (which was supposed to take 1 to 3 months) never came, it's been almost 2 years, we even went to check at the station 3 months into it and they laughed at us saying it would be at least 6 months. She couldn't work legally without this so she had to go back. We found places willing to hire her but they want her to already have a working visa, working visas seem impossible to get. Working and/or staying without proper documentation would be really easy but I don't want to risk it.\n\nI am in university and I'm lucky enough to have my family supporting me financially through that and further education, as long as I'm performing well (and I always have). However they will not support us getting married until I'm done with education and have a job so that's not an option. I considered quitting school and working but that would not only limit my earning potential but also create a rift with my family. Waiting for the end of my education and getting a job feels so far away (at least 4 more years for master and I would like to pursue a PHD). I wanted to do university in her country but my parents didn't approve of the universities that offered me scholarships over there.\n\nI have interned in religious organizations that help migrants but they seem to only help migrants that get here illegally. I understand their struggles and I would never wish that for my partner, and I love helping them learn Italian and navigate through life in Italy, however when it comes to my partner who is trying to come here legally these organizations can't (or won't) do anything to help.\n\nSo my situation is this, marriage is not an option for a long time, working here seems impossible, studying here is prohibitively expensive for a foreigner. I don't know if my mental health can handle the constant visits that last a few months and then months of not knowing if or when we will get to see each other again. I already had struggles with mental health in my teens and my mood stabilizers/therapy don't seem to be helping much when my life gets uprooted every few months. I have terrible mood swings for weeks before and after she leaves, and only really get better when I can start concretely working on ways to meet again. Recently another tourist visa expired and it's looking like it will be at least  5 months before we can get another one.\n\nMy questions are;\n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences trying to move to Europe?\n\nDoes anyone know organizations that could help with finding a job and getting the proper documentations for someone looking to immigrate?\n\nDoes anyone suffering with mental health issues have any healthy ways to cope with these constant changes and unknowns?\n\nThank you for reading this far, even if you have no way to help I'd love to hear your success stories as they might cheer me up.\n\nTL;DR I live in Italy and am looking for ways to help my partner (ZA) citizen to move here (legally).", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

It’s just that he’s become more dry and he used to be so energetic when texting me, so it’s making me feel worse. im clingy and im trying not to be, by giving him space- but lately it feels like im the one texting first, and he hasn’t texted me good morning for two days, and barely even said i love you anymore. yesterday he thanked me for giving him space and communicated how he felt, but he’s still acting off kinda?

{"id": "u/namicchi_1147", "user": "u/namicchi", "text": "My boyfriend (28M) said he finds it difficult to give me (27F) attention and is not open to communicating about it\n\nBefore dating me and my boyfriend were close friends for a couple of years in the same city (we were classmates) and started flirting when we were in different cities after graduation. Then he moved back to my city for work. We kinda started dating but it was always not so serious. In my life I always had some abroad plans so when we started dating, we thought that we only start this because we can’t control our emotions and can’t keep being friends only and at some point of my life i might go to a very far country that he might not able to come (but my initial abroad plan was cancelled because i didn’t got a scholarship that i need so we dated in the same city for years). \n\nAfter a year of dating, i started to be the person in the relationship that requests more attention (after the honeymoon phase ended). Somehow we managed to still stay in a relationship for 3 years even though we broke up for short whiles due to some fights related to us not fit each other that much or him not giving me girlfriend attention (only giving wholesome friend type of attention). \n\nLast year I moved in a different city for studies but i was visiting once in 3 weeks so we didn’t have a long period that we didn’t see each other. And he visited my city once (me coming to his place was much easier and economic than him coming to my city as i don’t have anywhere to host him) \n\n\nThis year I moved to a different country temporarily for 6 months. In 2 weeks ill go back to my country actually. In these 6 months we never met as i didn’t go back to my country and he didn’t come to the country i live now (he didn’t put much effort to get a visa even tho we were talking about him coming and us traveling together) \nthe first 2 months I was trying to have online calls and dates so that we still have a bond. When I invited him to these he was joining and having fun. But later on, my life in this country got more and more busy and I didn’t invite him to anything online. He also didn’t do it so many weeks passed without having contact other than short texts. As time passed I also got more distant to him and valued my friends and life in this new country more so i wasn’t nagging him much about the lack of communication. At some point I mentioned him that we got more distant and he agreed. He told me that he doesn’t know why it happened and he was joking that (as if talking about a business plan) “well we need to take action about this issue” when i asked him how he feels about this. Usually he has a personality that doesn’t share his emotions and jokes to change the topic or the focus of the question. \nI was talking this with my therapist also and I was telling her how he doesn’t show me attention. My therapist told me that I need to openly tell him that I need attention so I did, I called him and we had a convo about attention and I asked him “I want this from a boyfriend, can you give me the attention I need?” and he said “I am not sure if I can give the amount of attention you want, my personality isn’t like that and if I fake it, you’ll understand and it will be not genuine” and we decided to think more about this and not decide anything now. \n\nRecently I had another session with my therapist and she told me that how I describe attention might be different from someone else as it can be a vague term. So she wanted me to describe it. This made sense for me and I asked the same thing to him on text. I told him “my therapist mentioned this and that blablabla so, how do you describe attention?” \nhe responded me like “how i describe attention?” “I think we both know what attention means and we dont need to have this conversation” I just sent sad emoji face to that and he said “ I dont know its just we dont have anything to talk about and i find it difficult to do small talk and show attention, its like we’re very distant” and then i told that “okay nevermind i just asked because we talked this with my doctor so i wanted to ask you before i forget” \nand then he said “im sorry, are you okay?” and i said i am okay. so that was our last texts and i dont think we’re gonna talk much later \n\n\nthe thing is as he is a close friend and a boyfriend for such a long time i feel like he was the right person for me and he was sweet when we were not long distance. So im not sure if we live in the same city and get along well everything will be okay? or should i see this as a sign that he is not really into me anymore? what does it tell about a person that is mostly a good boyfriend when you are together but doesn’t do much to keep the spark alive when you are apart?\n\ntl;dr: We are an OKAY couple when we are in the same city but during long distance he stopped giving attention.

Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.\n\nAnyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.\n\nLong story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.\n\nUnfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.\n\nI guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps? I have a toddler and a baby coming, and really don't want to have to do this alone if I don't need to.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/Free_Boysenberry2680_1156", "user": "u/Free_Boysenberry2680", "text": "My Husband Told Me He’s Filing For Divorce Today\n\n\nMy Husband (34M) told me (32F) that he’s fed up and going to file for divorce.  We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.\n\nBackstory: \nMy husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years. \n\nHe can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined. \n\nAnytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.\n\nPretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.\n\nI thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong. \n\nEver since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.\n\nYesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”. \n\nIt felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive. \n\nHe ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since. \n\nAt this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling. \n\nHe left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.\n\nHe came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.” \n\nI responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce. \n\nAfter he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.\n\nI’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.\n\nI’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.\n\nREDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out. \n\nTL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.\n\n____________________\n\nUPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.\n\nFor the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more. \n\nSince this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:\n\nDaily plan: \n* Morning reflection / meditation\n* Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3\n* Workout\n\nWeekly plan:\n* Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)\n* Read 50 pages of self help books: \n    * The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1\n    * The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1\n    * Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15\n    * Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30 \n\nI told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes. \n\nI have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself. \n\nI can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post.

We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).\n\nAfter 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.\n\nThe night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.\n\nWe moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.\n\nIt’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.\n\nWe now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.\n\nTLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together.

What should I do?\n\nHello so, I (M25)  have been dating this guy (M25) for over a year. We are a gay couple. We had never had an argument before, and everything seemed perfect. We had a strong emotional connection and it truly felt I had met my soulmate.\nThere is one issue though. I have a medical condition that requires me to have a surgery to be sexually active (a circumcision). At the beginning, we had discussed this and he told me he would be ok waiting for me to have the surgery. I hesitated because he had expressed how he felt sex was an intimacy was an important aspect in a relationship, but he would be willing to wait given how well we connected.\nTwo months after starting dating officially, I got the surgery. Unfortunately, after recovery I learned that I would need a revision (second surgery). At the time, my boyfriend was very supportive and still said he would wait. \nNonetheless, around that time I got a new job and started grad school at the same time, which kinda delayed the entire surgery process. My boyfriend was supportive of the new job and me going to grad school.\nAt month 6, so like six months ago, we had our last conversation about the surgery, in which he expressed it was taking a toll on him. The reality was that although our relationship was perfect otherwise, we were never sexually intimate in any way at that point. I said I understood how he was feeling and that I would prioritize the surgery once I got on my new insurance from my new job. Life happened and between work and study, I couldn't prioritize the surgery. I never brought up that topic again, and he never did either. And as I said, everything else in the relationship was going well.\nSo fast forward to two weeks after our one year anniversary, he confessed he had a one night stand with a random guy. It was shocking for me to learn that. I was upset, angry, sad and disappointed at the same time. He never talked to me in the last 6 months about his frustration. I had the power to fix the problem. He could have told me and I would have gotten the surgery. \nHe did seem remorseful and showed me he would start going to therapy right away, but I feel conflicted. I know he loves me, and I love him too, but I don't know if I can ever trust him again, even if he confessed and can see that he deeply regrets his actions. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend confessed he cheated after us dating for one year due to us not having sex, which was not possible because I needed a surgery.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Growing up, I thought he was brilliant — but I now see he never considered anyone else’s opinion, argued endlessly and philosophically, never reached resolutions, and often discredited me or my mom.\n\nHe was diagnosed around age 70 with Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Hemicrania Continua. I try to take that into account, but his behavior has gotten worse over time.\n\nI have been living abroad for the past 4 years, and I regularly visit. I was visiting him for a few days this month. During one of his never-ending “talks,” I told him I think he behaves like a victimist narcissist, because he reframes everything so he’s the victim, discredits my feelings, and never takes responsibility. He did exactly that: he denied everything, accused me of being the narcissistic and victimistic one, and discredited my own experience of having lived 26 years with him, which led me to identify that pattern and express that to him with examples. He was not happy about what I said, but I eventually had to cut the conversation off because I had other commitments.\n\nLater that day, after I finished my commitments, he came to my room and insisted we continue talking. I refused and tried to leave. He blocked the door, grabbed my arms, and started screaming. His face and eyes looked almost possessed. He wouldn’t let go. I screamed at him to release me, but he held on tighter. For the first time in my life, I was genuinely afraid of him and feared for my life.\n\nI have never been in a fight before, and the first fight of my life was with my own dad. The one person who was supposed to protect and support me was instead the person making me fear for my safety.\n\nI tried to get free without hurting him, but he ended up stepping on something and fell. I helped him up, hoping it would calm him, but it didn’t. I attempted to pack while he kept grabbing me. Finally, in panic, I see his arm reaching my neck, and I bit him and pushed just enough to break free. I ran out the door and as far as I could before stopping.\n\nLater, he called my cousin (30F), saying my mom and I were “against him,” conveniently leaving out that he physically restrained me.\n\nThe next morning, I returned with my older cousin (51F) and uncle (80M) to collect my things. When I walked in, the same arms and nails that had dug into my skin the day before were now reaching out to hug me. He acted loving, like nothing had happened. I said “no” firmly, which he immediately used against me by telling my uncle, \"Do you see how she is with me?\". He followed me around, tried to block me again, but I stayed focused on leaving. If my relatives hadn’t been there, I believe he would have tried to stop me again.\n\nIt’s been almost two weeks. I’ve blocked him. I don’t think an apology would be sincere, and I’m scared of what he might say if we speak again. I’m planning to start therapy to process this, but I would appreciate advice or experiences from anyone who has been through something similar.\n\nTL;DR: My dad (73M), who has a personality disorder, blocked me from leaving during an argument, grabbed my arms, and raised his arm toward my neck.

For the first 6 months I would say things like, “you never have homework,” and he’d just say he already did it. But we were together almost all the time, so that didn’t make sense. Eventually he admitted he had dropped out. Around then I also brought him around my college friends—he barely said a word, gave me nothing to work with, and I finally told him he could leave. He did, though we reconciled that night.\n\nMy friends are so important to me. I’m an only child and they’ve always been like my family. They’re great people, with kind hearts, and they always show up for me. But his inability to connect or even be nice to them has been a huge issue. We tried several trips with them where I hoped he’d bond with the boyfriends, but he always ended up mad at me for something small, blowing up my phone with complaints, and wishing we could just leave instead of hanging out with the group.\n\nOne of the worst times was 2 years ago in Miami for a friend’s wedding. The first day he was fine, but the next he got upset, saying “why do they get to make all the decisions?” I’m very go with the flow, so that kind of stuff doesn’t bother me, but he made it into a fight. At dinner he started sulking again when asked to take photos of us, acted annoyed, and then shut me out—just one word answers and wouldn’t even look at me. It was so obvious and embarrassing. He refused to go out that night and the rest of the trip he kept the same attitude.\n\nThis kind of thing happened over and over. Even after college, anytime there was a get-together—Super Bowl, Halloween, anything—he always had excuses not to go. Meanwhile, I was working full time and he didn’t have a job, just school. But he wasn’t studying, he was just playing video games.\n\nAnother issue is his extreme OCD. If I left anything out, even for a second, he would get angry. I know it’s a real condition and I’ve tried so hard to be more organized, but I also have ADHD and it’s not always easy. Still, no matter how much I tried, it was never enough.\n\nWe also never went on dates. He hated going out because of anxiety and depression. I always wanted to get out of the house and enjoy new experiences together, but he didn’t want to.\n\nOver time, I’ve lost myself. In the last city we lived in (which he constantly complained about), I paid rent for both of us while he finished school. When we moved back near family, I thought it would get better. He did finally get a job, but the fights only got worse. I became depressed, and he blamed me for being less happy, saying I was “killing the mood.”\n\nFights would escalate to him saying things like “we’re done,” “get out,” or “I wish I had a girlfriend who cared about what I like.” Meanwhile, he never cared about anything of mine. I was just exhausted.\n\nStill, he is like a best friend. He knows me better than anyone, and I know he loves me. But he only ever changes for a few days before going back to the same patterns. I realized I couldn’t see myself marrying him or being happy long term.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I signed a lease. I was planning to tell him after a bachelorette trip, but the day before we got into another fight and I blurted it out. He was upset, then sad, then understanding. When I got back, things were heavy, but this past week he’s been kind and trying to make our last days together good. He’s broken down crying, telling me I’m the love of his life, and I do believe that I am to him.\n\nI love him so much, but I can’t do this anymore. It kills me knowing I’m taking most of the furniture from the house, leaving him in an empty space. I’ll miss him terribly, and I’ll miss his family—being an only child with older parents and no extended family, I loved how welcoming and warm they were.\n\nBut after 5 years, I know I need to try to find myself again. I feel awful, and I keep second guessing myself, but deep down I think it’s the right choice. Even if it breaks my heart. I don’t know if this is right. It just all feels so heavy.\n\nMy question is: Should I fully move on and close this chapter for good, or should I leave the door open for the possibility of trying again in the future after we’ve both had time to grow separately? If my goal is to heal, grow, and eventually have a healthy long-term relationship (whether with him or with someone else), what should I do next?\n\nTLDR: I (26F) am ending a 5-year relationship with my boyfriend (26M). He never connected with my friends, avoided social events, and often picked fights. His OCD, anxiety, and depression made daily life hard—we never went on dates, and despite my effort it was never enough. I supported us financially while he was in school, but things didn’t improve after he got a job. The fights and negativity wore me down, and I realized I couldn’t see a future with him. I love him and his family deeply, but I need to leave to find myself again, even though it breaks my heart. My question: Should I focus on moving forward and letting go, or should I consider the idea of trying again in the future after time apart?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/super_advice_dog_1170", "user": "u/super_advice_dog", "text": "My (40f) husband (40m) says I am killing our marriage by not drinking\n\nWe're married 18 years. Have kids for 5. When we met I didn't drink but started drinking socially as my husband and whole peer group drank alcohol and I was feeling intense peer pressure. I did enjoy it (maybe even too much sometime), and had fun.\n\nOver the years, especially at work events, I noticed that alcohol increases my anxiety, and despite feeling like an odd one out on many events, I switched to only drinking alcohol with my husband and family friends.\n\nThen we decided to have kids, we kept trying and of course I stopped drinking when I got pregnant. Then I breastfed and had another baby, and at the beginning of this year finally finished breastfeeding.\n\nTried alcohol again a few times and didn't enjoy it at all. As if my taste buds just went bad and all alcohol just tastes horrible. Even from half a glass of wine I am getting migraines now, and on top of that my anxiety skyrockets to extreme, including panic attacks.\n\nI've done a lot in the past half a year regarding my anxiety, focused on health, sleep etc. and decided to not drink or take anything mind altering at least until I am sure this is not going to affect my mental health negatively. Plus, we have kids now and I am the one waking up to them every morning - parenting is hard as it is, and introducing something that makes me feel worse in all aspects is not a great idea. I don't mind him getting a drink, don't judge him for that, although he keeps saying I do.\n\nMy husband is pissed. Devastated. He said it was fine while I had a reason and now I am just making up one. That alcohol is a dealbreaker for him and it was a big part of our relationship.  That I am taking a stance that will ruin our marriage. I offered to find other things to connect over, he refuses. A few months ago he wanted to get some wine - I also took a glass to keep him company but didn't drink mine beside a few sips and he got offended. Says no person in his life has turned down a drink with him except me and that he feels rejected and alone.\n\nI get that and I don't want him to feel alone. I do not oppose to him having a drink or going out with friends. I like the company and happy to get something non-alcoholic when we hang out. Of course, the frequency of those events have decresed dramatically since having kids. We don't go on dates - I offered a few times and my husband refused saying it's because I don't drink. He keeps questioning me and saying my decision is ridiculous. He also said that I am singlehandedly killing our relationship by not drinking.\n\nFrankly I have no idea where to go from here. He says we'll divorce or he'll find another woman to drink with. Unless I agree to a two drinks a week, he says our relationship is over.\n\nI just don't understand this. Feeling completely lost. I don't think alcohol is the issue here, but according to my husband it absolutely is. He is not an alcoholic as far as I know. I understand it's about connection and we did drift apart during these crazy years of having kids. I neglected myself to take care of the family and our relationship took a hit. I am doing way better and actually making time to shower, go running, do better at work. Went to a psychologist to sort out anxiety and panic attacks. Made more time to spend with my husband. We mostly watch TV in the evening and continue home renovation in the afternoons. Weekends are traveling with kids. He refuses to go on dates with me, saying it's because I don't drink - although I don't mind him drinking.\n\nI too, miss the connection we used to have and want to keep the marriage alive. There's also kids, who need their mom and dad. It sounds completely weird to me that the connection we had was alcohol, and I know it wasn't. It's my fault of completely neglecting myself and our relationship these past years, but I was in such a bad place without help and I don't know if I even was capable of doing anything differently. And now it just went to absurd - my husband is saying that I took a stance of not drinking and gave him an ultimatum, which in turn forces him to give me an ultimatum - drink or separate. I tried explaining why I don't drink but he doesn't understand it and says it's my whim which breaks the marriage.\n\nHow do I keep our marriage together? We used to be close, and happy, and I miss that a lot. He won't even hug me anymore, and now doesn't want to talk to me. I know he's hurt and feels alone and I want to reconnect, but he's been turning down my attempts.\n\nTL; DR: I stopped drinking after getting pregnant and having kids. Cannot tolerate alcohol anymore, plus my anxiety skyrockets. My husband says I am singlehandedly killing our marriage and he'll find someone else unless I start drinking again. I want to keep our marriage together.

When we’re were both 20, and 21 I told him that I would like to start a family by 25. I was kinda depressed at 25, my frontal lobe definitely developed and I started to feel resentment towards my boyfriend, obviously we didn’t start a family and I just recently turned 26 but feel sad, almost 5 years have flown by and I feel like we’re still where we were when we first started dating.

I don’t know what to do\n\nTL;DR We met in 2023 and we moved pretty fast after we met. I wanted to slow down but he said he knew what he wanted and that by me saying I wanted to slow down it meant I wasn’t taking him serious but I was so we kept being “together”. A lot of the things he had done/said looking back now I was so naive. I thought maybe this is how relationships are, learning to accommodate one another and to take their words into consideration. I was never asked to be a gf and I thought I was making it too big of a deal. Yet we still called eachother bf and gf. Hes my first boyfriend and I lost my virginity to him and I was dumb enough to have sex with him on our first date. I’ve been on dates with other guys I didn’t have sex with them but when I went on a date with my bf he was so different. I knew I wanted to be with him. Through out 2023 he accused me of having sex with my stepdad just because I don’t have that good of a relationship with my mom. He accused me of cheating, he would go through my phone, he had my location but I couldn’t have his, he accused me of being too mysterious, I’ve been so patient and explaining to him what your accusing me of is not true. How can I prove something that never happened? How much more do I have to explain myself??\n\nfast foward, 2024, I found out he’s been cheating. Lol what a surprise I know. Looking back I should’ve known. I was so heartbroken, I think I still am. I’ve never felt this way before. I also found out I was pregnant and had gotten herpes type 1 and 2. I felt my world shatter that day. The whole 2024 we argued so much I had so many things to say and questions I wanted answered, some were truthful and some were lies. He kept talking to multiple women. Got on dating apps. But still told me he loved me and that they mean nothing. I cried every month that year. We got into a really bad fight at the bar the cops came and people recorded us. We still ended up together.\n\nEntering 2025 he kept talking to the same girls again and new people. meeting up but no sex. He says he only talks to other people to use them not to replace me. I went through his phone and found messages from 2020 that show he’s been fucking around with the same people for YEARS. It sounds horrible and you’re probably wondering why I’m still here. Aside from his cheating behavior and anger he’s the sweetest. I see him try so hard to show me he loves me by doing things he knows mean something to me. Rereading all of this I sound so brainwashed and stupid. With or without him I’m sad. I see no point in meeting new people when other guys  are gonna do me worse or still do me wrong one way or another. If I do date other people how do I even bring up I have herpes? I feel like I have no way out but to be here and try to work through it. Right now we aren’t talking because I didn’t have enough money to buy him a Gatorade so I said no you can’t get a drink so he took the one I bought and drank almost all of it and saved me like 3 gulps. From the gas station to my house we argued and it got silent at the end, He was supposed to drop me off to my car but instead dropped me off at my house away from my car (he can’t be seen at my house we have cameras and my mom doesn’t want him there) he made me walk from my house to my car, he parked on the side of the road and walked me to my car on the other side of the side walk!!!!!!

I struggle to defend my fiancée in certain situations, and it is tearing her to pieces. This post is probably going to be all over the place, so I apologize in advance.\n\nI am not good with conflict, especially when it involves those I love—specifically, my mother, father, and my fiancée. Whenever these situations arise, I cannot find the words to defend my fiancée when I know something being said is wrong. This leads her, understandably, to feel as though I do not care enough about her to defend her—that I’d rather side with my parents, or that I am not afraid to lose her.\n\nIn my head, I feel like I know all of the right things to say, but I just cannot find the ability to say them. I understand when a situation we are in is wrong, but I cannot bring myself to defend her. It's like I try to hide in my own body or mind, because I do not want to deal with what this comes with. I want to give some examples of what I mean.\n\n**The Cruise** — My father invited me and her on a family cruise they were planning. My fiancée and I thought it would be fun, and we talked about it back and forth. The next day, my father called and said it would be better to leave it as immediate family. I went along with it and gave zero pushback. When I told my fiancée what my dad had said, she was of course upset—because she had been invited, and then uninvited. I had no questions for my dad about where this came from, why she was uninvited, or why she was invited in the first place. My fiancée (girlfriend at the time) was upset because I did not defend her. I didn’t question my dad—I just went along with it.\n\n**The Bridal Shower** — My fiancée was speaking with me and my mom, and she mentioned that she wanted to do her bridal shower around six months before the wedding. Since we’re looking at getting married in May, if she did it the “traditional” two months before, it would fall during the Canadian winter, which wouldn’t be ideal. My mom pushed back and was adamant that six months was way too early and that it *had* to be two months before the wedding. My fiancée was understandably upset with me for not defending her, because ever since I proposed, we agreed we were going to do things our way. I didn’t step in or push back on my mom. Looking back, I should have said something like, “Why does it have to be two months out?” or “We already have a plan we envisioned, and we’re going to stick to it.”\n\nThere have been other times I haven’t stood up for us, always involving my parents. I’m not one for confrontation, and ever since I was young, I’ve done whatever my parents wanted. My fiancée, on the other hand, is used to standing up for herself in situations like these. She stands up for me with her family 100% of the time, and I admire that—but I just can’t bring myself to do the same.\n\nI love my fiancée. I know I need to stand up for her and her feelings. I just struggle to physically do it, and I’m scared I won’t change. I want to stand up for her. I want to support her no matter what, because she is my other half and she would do that for me any day. I just cannot find the way to actually do it.\n\nIt’s like I freeze up. I can recognize that “this situation is wrong,” and I can think of what to say, but by the time I figure it out, the moment has already passed and I can’t say it anymore. I don’t know how to change this. I don’t know how I can become more automatic with my responses, instead of overthinking to the point where I can’t speak, defend, or rebut.\n\nI struggle with upsetting those I love. I feel torn between upsetting my parents or defending my fiancée. I can’t find the ability to face my fears and stand up for us, no matter what the other opinion may be. It’s hard for me to go against the people who raised me.\n\nWe’ve been off for the past couple of days because of the bridal shower argument. I’ve been reflecting, and here’s where my head is at so far: I need to understand that everyone will always have an opinion, and if my opinion upsets someone—no matter who it is—it shouldn’t matter. I need to defend my fiancée when something is not right, especially when we’ve agreed to do things our way, but then as soon as someone challenges us, I just freeze. I need to get over my fear of conflict, because I think just *starting* the conversation would be enough for me to defend her—I just need to get there. I get anxious about starting fights, especially with my parents.\n\nI am looking for feedback—anything to help me get over my fear of disappointing people I care about, so I can defend my fiancée and myself.\n\n**TL;DR**: I have a hard time defending my fiancée against my parents. I freeze up and cannot find a way to initiate that part of the conversation until I’ve overthought it and the moment has already passed.\n\nI read a comment on another post, that read \"Think about why it is that other people's feelings matter more to you than your wife's.\" and this hit home for me. This sparked more and more thinking.  \n\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: just an update for anybody that is seeing this post later. This is the next morning. I’ve read through and responded to most comments as much as I could. I appreciate everybody’s input. I was not looking for Reddit to solve my problems. I was more looking for some guidance and a kick in the ass to get the help I need. I’ve always contemplated therapy, but I think it is what I need and some of the people commenting have introduced me to CBT therapy which I’ve never heard about so I appreciate that as well. \n\nThank you for all of the people that have given me good advice and also shared stories. I appreciate that.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I was talking normally but suddenly he yelled at me saying what are you even talking about I don't need your permission to go fight with someone who I have a problem with and in the end he cut the call on my face. I was really stunned and obviously felt hurt too. Later he called and apologised and said that the reason he acted this way over it is because he felt like I was displaying him as weak and thinking that I feel like he would lose and stuff like that. And also mentioned that in his childhood some things have happened where he always felt weak and was always termed that way that's why what I said triggered some memory.I didn't say anything on it but 8 still felt really bad about it. A few days later I was telling him about something sensitive like my father had yelled at me about something so I crying about it to him and he was comforting me but then I said you also yelled at me why am 8 telling you this. I was still crying and in the heat of the moment here. But then he started to say \"what you were doing you deserved it\" and \"I would do it again you made me feel that bad that's why 8 did it\" and I felt really hurt About it so I said you're just like my father and that I don't feel like telling you anything you're so terrible etc etc . Then we had a heated argument. Note that my point was that if I didn't intentionally trigger any memory then why is he harsh with me and his point was that intentionally or unintentionally you did trigger it and the memory is so bad that it's deserving. At the end of the argument he told me what the probelm was , he said he was $a'€d when he was a child. He also was always called weak and wimp by everyone since he was a kid and that's why it happened.  He had never told me this especially the first part. I was really stunned and felt bad for him. But now he doesn't feel like talking to me he doesn't feel like facing me cause I know it and he never wanted me to know but apparently I had pushed him to that limit. He's barely talking and no matter how much 8 try he can't seem to forget about it. any advice ?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend has opened up about a past memory and he feels bad talking to me or facing me now.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He and I have barely been dating for a few months but about a week or two ago I realized I might be a lesbian or aroace. I really thought I liked him but I always struggle to tell the difference between romantic and platonic feelings, so I think thats what happened again. I tried to get those feelings back but it just makes me regret it more and more. He's done nothing wrong, he's an amazing guy, but I just don't like him.\n\nI planned to break up with him this upcoming Sunday since he would have 3 days off from work, so I thought it'd be perfect so he could have time to process it and relax. But recently his workplace has been getting more toxic since his managers are racist and make fun of him because of his adhd. And then a few days ago they called him in for a meeting and told him they were replacing him from someone in another store. I think they're just going to be switching places but the managers at the new place are also racist.\n\nI know I need to break up with him before the relationship goes on any longer but I feel so horrible and I don't want him to get more depressed than he already is with life. His family is horrible to him and his self-esteem is nonexistent, plus he never talks to anyone else because he says he's not social. When we first became friends, I had to put in so much effort since he's so afraid of being himself. Last week, I tried to help him become friends with someone that he already somewhat knew, but he just stayed quiet the whole time. And whenever I say I have plans with a friend, of course he doesn't stop me, but he just ends up alone on his phone the entire time until I'm back and it makes me feel bad.\n\nHe's truly not a bad person, he's just given up on life and I don't want this breakup to be his last straw. I have a script ready on what to say but I don't know if its nice enough to not hurt him. I don't want to tell him about my sexuality or that I lost feelings for him, I just wanted to tell him that the reason for breaking up is because of my mental health, which isn't a lie. I don't think I'm mentally capable of a relationship right now or maybe ever. I have no idea what my life is going to be like and I struggle with depression too. I just wish I could have those feelings for him but I really don't.

We broke up maybe a month and a half- 2 months ago for a few days, then a week and finally 2 weeks and then got back together it was her who wanted to split. She said at the time she hadn’t felt seen, mothered me which I disagree with, trapped. \n\nWe both saw other people during the breakup but did not sleep with them and made us both realize we were happy with each other. We got back together almost a month ago and talked about us laying out finances, house plan, kid plan, marriage, engagement. Everything was looking up and we decided to get a dog even though we have 3 cats and she told me when we got back together she is in it for the long haul, marriage etc. she said I’ve changed and I am the perfect guy.\n\nFlash forward to last night she told me that she’s not breaking up with me but she is feeling trapped because she said I rushed her to get back together when I gave her her space I moved out temporarily for 2 weeks, let her do her own thing, we went to dinner the Sunday before we got back together it was nice, came home and made love I went back to my place because she said it felt like a mistake/rushed. Then told me an hour later to come back over because it was cold in the bed without me, from this point on it was like we were dating again all week and the Sunday after dinner and everything we attended church and got back together and got the dog the next Saturday, we have been attending church every Sunday since.\n\nToday we talked after she was off of work and she told me she needs her space and doesn’t know what to do because I am the “perfect guy” I changed everything I did that she hated before the breakup, and I have been selfless and she isn’t sure why mentally she is like this. I told her during our breakup how I felt, where I stood if we got back together. She told me today too that she felt like she had the pressure of me and her parents and her whole family pushing her to get back with me because they must like me enough lol but she blamed me for feeling rushed and I don’t know how I did rush her when I gave her space she needed and she hit me back up. \n\nWe’re still together as of right now but do you think we should split, fix it, I love her so much and she is a girl I would marry and I would love to raise a family with but I’m not sure what to do\n\n we broke up last night for good she is done and wants to move on because she doesn’t know what it is about her but she can’t commit to me but I love her and I want to give her everything I have and more and I think that fucks me up more than anything because she tells me I’m the perfect person but she can’t get over stuff from 6 years ago, like me saying really mean ass bully type texts when we first started dating til maybe 2 years in and standing her up at a wedding 5 years ago but the past year and a half to two years she said I have changed and right now I’m the “perfect” guy in every way but mentally she can’t figure out why she doesn’t want to be with and why she has to try to stay in it, should we just breakup and stay apart\n\nTLDR we have our struggles but I love her and I know she loves me but what is she talking about with not wanting to commit anymore", "disorder_norm": ["MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

There was definite attraction but we decided to take things slow. We started official dating 3 months ago. We both are really happy together. He is definitely my person. \n\nI met his friends few weeks ago for the first time in a party. He knows a lot of people but has only 2-3 close male friends.\n\nAt the party, I realised most of his female friends were literal models. Every single one, extremely beautiful, great dressing sense, overall very impressive. My bf went to an elite boarding school and has lots of friends from there and they regularly keep in touch. I started feeling like the odd one at the party but I kept it to myself. I could feel the girls were a bit uncomfortable with me, it might have been because I was new to them but I kept feeling like they were looking down on me. \n\nLater when he dropped me home, I did talk to him about feeling a little less about myself after seeing his pretty friends. He was very understanding, counted down all the reasons why he would always choose me in a room full of people. \n\nI have met his friends a couple of times after that..and I realised my insecurities won’t go away.\n ‘Why would he be with me when all these amazing women who are also really kind exist?’ \n\nTo give a brief description, I am 5’4” / 55kgs.

I am trying to do multiple things to be more feminine. But I feel very stupid at times because as much as I want to be it, it doesn’t feel like myself. \n\nMy bf has never really complimented me for my appearance, he doesn’t do it for anyone really. \n\nMy bf has started noticing me being dull and he tries to cheer me up but I can’t help myself. I have started to feel like he deserves better than me. I can’t bring myself up to discuss this issue further with him because I am already feeling really under confident. \n\nI need someone to give me a little more perspective. What can I do to help myself here? \n\n TL; DR - Ive been dating my bf for 3 months after knowing him for years.

{"id": "u/ThrowRAbig_oop_1183", "user": "u/ThrowRAbig_oop", "text": "My boyfriend (27M) lied about subscribing to explicit content and I (25F) am struggling to rebuild trust\n\nMy boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about six months. We’re both busy students who live in different cities, so we usually see each other ~2x/month.\n\n**Incident #1**: Back in April, Instagram suggested a recently created account my boyfriend was following. It had a suggestive username and a VERY busty, revealing profile picture. Curious, I went to the profile and found it was a gaming account with only 10 followers (including him). I soon discovered he was also following the same girl’s art account and main account. She’s a very talented artist, but he “liked” very few of her art posts, but nearly all of her revealing photos. Granted, his liking history was before we met so I don’t hold that against him on its own, but he followed this gaming account *after* we had become exclusive. When I brought this up, he explained she’s someone he met about six years ago through activism, and that he followed her gaming account because he likes to “support people’s hobbies” and added that he thinks she has a boyfriend. He offered to unlike the revealing photos and unfollow the gaming and art accounts, but wanted to keep her main account for “activism connection” (though she hasn’t been doing any in recent years AFAIK). He was very calm when I confronted him.\n\n**Incident #2**: In late July, we were chilling on the sofa and I saw another very exposed cleavage photo sitting on his phone. He quickly turned it away and said, “oh, just a silly subreddit.” Unconvinced, I looked up r/ cleavage…and there it was: the exact photo. When I asked if he was subscribed, he said yes but claimed he “just scrolls past” and had “just been too lazy to unsubscribe.” Later (after more probing), he admitted he did actively look, was also subscribed to r/ tits, and acknowledged he knew it would hurt me but continued anyway. Again, he stayed very calm when confronted, so I wonder if he was trying to seem unbothered so I wouldn’t think he’s guilty.\n\nI should note that my chest is on the smaller side, so I can’t help but wonder if he secretly prefers the opposite body type. I tried to move past the Instagram incident and take his word for why he followed that account, but the Reddit incident makes me feel like it’s not as likely he was just “supporting her hobby.” My trust in him has taken a serious hit from all of this. I also felt it was an insult to my intelligence that he thought I’d believe his “just scroll past” excuse.\n\n**My conflict**:\n-  He is autistic, and I have ADHD and am likely autistic too, so I understand the dopamine-seeking + social nuance struggles. He told me that he might have a minor addiction and had unfollowed other explicit content after we got together, but has struggled to completely cut himself off. I just can’t tell how much is neurodivergence vs. a lack of respect.\n-  He’s been extremely apologetic and reassuring, never got defensive, and insists he finds me attractive and wouldn’t rather be with someone with a larger chest.\n-  But he has a history of staying in unhealthy relationships because he didn’t think he could do better, which makes me wonder if he’s settling for me.\n-  Since this happened, my body image has taken a big hit, and some days I struggle to reciprocate his physical affection. He notices when I pull back, but it seems like he doesn’t fully grasp how much this has affected me.\n-  My mom says I’m overreacting and that “guys are just like that,” but my friend (who introduced us) told me that this seems like a pattern and wouldn’t be surprised if this keeps happening, so it’d be a dealbreaker for her. I told my new therapist about this yesterday, and she agreed this is a big red flag.\n\n**What I need advice on**:\n-  How do I know if this is something that can be worked through with boundaries, or a dealbreaker?\n-  How do I rebuild trust after he deliberately sought out explicit content and lied about it?\n-  For those who’ve experienced similar situations: what helped you decide if the relationship could be saved?\n\n\n**TL;DR**: BF (27M) followed a busty girl’s gaming account on Instagram and later lied about subscribing to explicit subreddits of women with the opposite body type from mine.

I was a neglectful and distant partner who would repeatedly break my promise and forget things.

We have been together for over a year and she means a lot to me, and I do not want to lose what we have. At the same time, it has been getting harder to handle certain patterns that are wearing me down. Her happiness seems to depend almost entirely on me, and that dependence has become overwhelming. While I enjoy supporting her, I cannot be the only source of her security or emotional stability.\n\nThese patterns were present before, but they have intensified since I started university. During the summer, we met frequently and spent long periods together. Now that I have less free time because of my studies, we see each other much less.

These fears sometimes result in nightmares, even when we are sleeping next to each other. She frequently wakes up upset, and even though I try to comfort her, the situation does not improve.\n\nThere are also smaller patterns that add up. She worries about small things I do or say, checks my phone when we are together, and wants us to spend much of our time on calls, even during periods of rest. These behaviors make me feel restricted and monitored.\n\nWe also have some differences in lifestyle and preferences. They are not extreme, but they have affected how comfortable I feel in certain situations. Combined with the other issues, it sometimes feels like we are not fully aligned in how we live and interact, which has been difficult for me.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling emotionally exhausted. I feel like I am constantly careful not to trigger her anxiety, which limits my own sense of freedom. Despite investing a lot of time and energy into supporting the relationship, these patterns have intensified rather than improved.\n\nI am torn because I care deeply about her and our relationship. Ending things would be complicated and painful, but I am also concerned about how sustainable this dynamic is. Both families know about us, we have many mutual friends.

During that break I found out through a mutual friend that he got very close to some other girls who r his juniors. One of them apparently has feelings for him, and they sometimes hug. I even saw some group photos where he had his hand on her shoulder and they look really close which broke me.🥺💔\n\nHe told my friend that hel'll reduce contact once l'm back, because of me..But he also said it'll make him feel very bad because those girls only \"stabilized\" him by being around while I wasn't there. He even says she's very humble and not touchy, and that she told him she'd be happy if I came back & that just confuses me. How can someone be that sweet and be a one-sided lover while knowing one already has a partner? Am overthinking that the girl is just waiting for me to backoff while being too nice to him and they'll be in a relationship once am gone 😭.\n\nOn top of all this, we won't be talking for another 2-3 months as we had a deal that he'd focus on scoring good marks first and then we'd reconnect. So l've got all this information now and I don't even know how to react while we're not in touch.💔\n\nMy insecurities are at peak. I'm overthinking constantly and feeling really low.. even feel like leaving him because the pain is that bad🥺. I don't know whether to confront him when we talk again, to trust him, or to walk away.

Why do I feel this way and what does it mean?\n\nHey everyone. I'm in desperate need for some relationship advice. I 23M and my girlfriend 25F have been together for almost two years. We moved into an apartment at 1 year as it made sense for both of us money wise and we just wanted to be with each other more. \n\nIn the beginning, we were very physical and touchy. Affection was not a problem for either of us. But now at two years. I'm no longer interested in sex and I'm extremely unaffectionate. I work shift work (7pm-7am) and I'm on anti depressants. So when we have off time together I just wanna relax and do nothing as I'm exhausted. She on the other hand is very affectionate and she's starting to have some issues of not feeling loved/cared for. I completely understand why she's feeling this way. I use to be affectionate in the beginning. But after getting this job (which I've only had for a year) I've become a different person basically. I have also started going to therapy but have only had 1 session with my next being in 2 weeks.\n\nAnother thing I'm struggling with is I feel like I'm looking for validation/affection from outside my relationship. Our joint friend group has a couple single females in it and I feel part of me wanting to hangout with them more. I feel like I'm looking at a \"grass is greener\" situation and don't know how to stop that feeling. I'd never act on anything well in a relationship either. \n\nThe reason I'm seeking advice is because I really don't know what to do. Am I losing feelings or am I just out of that honeymoon phase and looking for the adrenaline feeling of a new relationship. Why do I now not feel affectionate with my girlfriend like I use too. And what could I do to regain that spark back. Shes very affectionate and open to trying stuff to make me more affectionate. I also care about her deeply hence why I'm making this post. I wanna figure this out. \n\nI definitely can give more info if needed. Figured this would be a good starting ground and people could give me some advice \n\nTL;DR: I'm not affectionate towards my girlfriend and I think I might be losing feelings.

We’ve said I love you to each other and he gained my trust enough for us to be sleeping together. I thought that he truly loved me for who I was but with what happened last night, I’m not sure.\nLast night, after sex, we were bored and decided to have some deep conversations. We made a list of questions on ChatGPT and had it choose randomly. \n\nThe first random question was “What is the funniest thing that’s happened to you during sex?” And he answered first. I learned more abt his past sex life so I felt comfortable enough to share mine but he didn’t see it the way I thought and asked if I was hiding anything from him. Though I said no, he suspected one thing I could be lying abt was my body count. That, I have not lied abt. It was always 3 people before him. \n\nBut I then told him that if it’s outside of sex itself(so like on call and sending pics and stuff) there were abt 3 in high school. He started to get judgy so I told him that I’m not proud of it either and I basically ruined my life with it bc the last guy that I did stuff with, he took a screenshot of my nudes and kept it saved, that went on to being shown around his friends (the entire American football team) and rumors about me started spreading and I became known as the high school s-word for it. \n\nHe started making comments on my “hyper sexuality” bc most of the times we do it together, I’m the one asking him for it so I also explained to him that after talking with my therapist that I realized my actions and my mindset wasn’t because of a high sex drive but bc of a collective of past traumas that had shaped how I view life and myself in a very obscure way. \n\nAfter I told him that that was my most shameful secret he just got up, put his clothes on and left the room without me. I followed him out and I asked why he’s just leaving me after I told him that and he asked me why i didn’t tell him before he asked me to be his gf. I tried to make my point that I couldn’t tell him that yet we were barely getting to know each other and I even asked him if he would’ve still asked me to be his gf if he knew this and he said no. I asked him if he thinks I’m a s-word for that and he said yes. He also started saying that he was dating to marry and if I really cared abt him then I would’ve told him before we became official bc if we get married and if someone who has those photos leaks them somewhere, it’s not only me who’s going to be affected but other people as well. But I told him that I didn’t tell him before we became official bc I didn’t know whether I could trust him with that side of me yet. Yet he keeps saying that I shouldn’t have kept something like that from him and he wouldn’t even hold my hand or treat me like he loved me. He doesn’t say I love you back he just left and said bye and that’s it. \n\nWas I wrong for not telling him it before he asked me to be his gf? Where am I in the wrong on this?

I'm debating the relationship with him because while he checks all my boxes (we laugh together, I love his sense of humor, can have intellectual conversations, I'm attracted to him, similar lifestyle and aspirations, he is smart and has a great career, handsome), our relationship can feel like we're friends or bro's about half of the time. Firstly, the most important aspect of this is that I know that he cares about me and he has expressed so and his actions show that he cares. However, he is very particular and needs things done in a certain way, as well as sometimes turning up his nose to doing silly things or even things like me touching his thigh while driving because it feels in masculine. He is also very weird about bodily functions and sometimes acts disgusted by things like womanly cycles on clothes. In the bedroom it is great just lacking the experimental nature I usually enjoy. I think he is down to do maybe 70% of what I am interested in, but this is a big part if a relationship for me so I would want more. \n\nHe never calls me pet names except while we're in the act of sleeping together because he says he just doesn't do that. We also have had conversations about how there may be something missing, and that while he is satisfied with a few texts a day, I want more talking and just generally a lot more deeper conversations and words. I think where I'm struggling is that I am a deeply independent person, but I just want to feel loved too. My job is high powered and stressful with a lot of responsibilities that deeply fulfill me, so in a partnership I want to feel adored and simply be able to have the small little things like kisses and compliments. I feel like the only way to feel connection with him is through physical touch and sometimes discussions about things, but there are no future plans and we both admitted that we love each other but are not \"in love\" yet.  \n\nAnother issue is lack of emotional leadership. I brought up exclusivity which he was happy about, but I was hoping he would take the next step into asking me to be his gf. Which I was not because we never called each other that. That only semi happened when we were having a discussion last month and I brought this up. To which he shyly said that he would like that.  So we were essentially exclusive and committed to each other sans title. I'm not blaming him for being shy, but he is a very boisterous man and says his mind so feeling like there's no emotional leadership from his end feels quite empty. I also think sometimes he can be pretentious, and I don't like feeling like he will turn his nose up at something randomly. He was considering moving to another area for a job and we would have broken up then but he stayed, and a small part of me wishes that I wouldn't have to make the decision and it would have just been made for me in this way. \n\nI care about him deeply, really respect him, and he feels like a dear part of my life, but I am just perhaps looking for advice on what this means and is this enough to walk away? I know he cares and he's shown up for me over and over, but I feel lonely in a lot of ways and like I need a greater quantity of affection then he enjoys giving, Not sure if that is a weak reason to have doubts. I'd appreciate any insights! \n\nTLDR - A guy (28m) checks all my (29f) boxes but is a bit pretentious and lacks emotional leadership.

This isn't my first relationship ever, but I definitely consider it my first serious relationship. We've always had a super strong bond and even on days that we spend time together when I'm not really feeling it, she and I always have a lot of fun with each other. We bounce off each other in both silly and serious ways extremely well, we both think about the future often, we both enjoy a lot of similar activities, and overall we seem to on the surface be a really good match for each other. Despite all of this however, I've really started thinking about splitting ways as of the past few months and I've come to no conclusion on my own. There are a lot of factors for me wanting this, but I suppose I'll just try to write them down in some natural order and let the thoughts pour out. Apologies if I write this story a little bit all over the place. :)\n\nFor one, as my senior year is closing up in HS (I'm a September baby so I'm older than most of my class) I cant help but feel like I'm missing out on something. Not necessarily other women, though I'd be lying if I said that wasn't a factor, I mostly just feel like the early adulthood single experience is a very important time in a lot of peoples lives. I know for certain there's a lot of growth to be had during this period of time, and a lot of connections that can be made with other people or memories made, and I can't help but feel like I'm holding myself back from all of this if I decide to stay with my current partner. I feel like I have no room to go anywhere or grow in any way, and whenever I'm with her I start to feel like I'm the same person I was when I met her, despite me knowing just how much I've still changed over this past year. It just makes me wonder.. if I feel held back now, what would that be like in 10, 20 years? I also feel like I shouldn't start out my adult life the exact same way it'll be when I die. I suppose in simpler terms, I feel stuck.\n\nAnother factor is that I feel like she is unintentionally extremely emotionally manipulative, and strangely enough I feel like it's only been amplified over time. My own theory is that her lack of a strong example of a good relationship in her parents possibly plays a role here, but I don't really know the reason. Either way, it feels really shitty. A great example is this last weekend. We've hung out basically every single Sunday since we got together, it sort of just became \"our day\". While I definitely enjoy this time with her, all she ever wants to do is sit and watch movies. Literally every single time, sit and watch movies. I've never really been a movie person. Of course I'll make compromises and do some things with her that she enjoys, but it seems like I never get to do anything that I enjoy (eg. outdoors stuff). Despite her claiming an interest in it, she always has an excuse to just sit and watch movies instead.. and it sucks. Wrapping back though, I feel like a good example of what I feel like is emotional manipulation is this last weekend. This last weekend I really just wasn't feeling it anymore, and in my own mind I think it's reasonable after over a year to maybe not spend every Sunday together, especially just watching movies, so I just politely told her how I wasn't really feeling it. She went totally ballistic, freaking out, and went to her same arguments of \"I miss you though!\" or \"well but I want to!\" etc. Eventually she pulled out the \"do you still love me?\" card, to which I basically politely told her that she was losing her lid and really needed to just try to understand where I was coming from. That's not the only example I have, and my friends have had some experiences with her in the past that I really don't like, but that's besides the point.\n\nBottom line is, I love her a lot, I really genuinely do. But, I feel like I'm strapped down to something that will only hold me back. I feel like I'm sort of \"trapped\", but I'm afraid of leaving because I both feel like I was lucky enough to get her, but I also know how much I love her and a lot of things about her and I know how painful all of it would be. I've had a few conversations where we ended up deciding to just \"work it out\", but I still find myself back here. I'm really not enjoying much of my time with her anymore, I can't even bring myself to read or answer texts half the time anymore, and I just feel like I owe it to myself to have a free adult life where I don't feel like I'm babysitting an adult 12 year old (as much as that sounds mean). It's a shitty spot to be in, and I agree with something my dad told me, which was \"if you're feeling this way about it now, it's probably not going to get any better if you wait until you move in together\". I also struggle because I don't want to be in a situation where my hypothetical future kid comes to me for relationship advice and I can't provide any because I've only really been in this one.\n\nAll of this really is extremely difficult to navigate, and I really could go into it in more depth and I might reply to comments and do that if I feel like it's necessary, but I feel like just having some advice tailored to my personal experience will probably help me to make a decision of some sort one way or the other. They'll at least be more helpful than reading posts of people with *similar enough* experiences, lol.\n\n**TLDR**; My GF and I have a seemingly good relationship, but I feel held back and don't know what to do.\n\nI know it'd hurt both me and her badly, especially with how close we've gotten, but I feel like I should focus on what I think is best for my life. I want to make it clear that there really isn't any ill feelings between us. And, as of right now, I feel like parting ways to focus on my own life and personal growth/experience is the best thing. It's tricky to navigate all of this, so I really would like some help.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Is this a red flag?\n\nHi Reddit, I need some outside perspective.\n\nI’ve been in a long-distance relationship for a year now. Our birthdays are a month apart. Mine came first when we had only been dating for 3 months. I didn’t expect a gift at all (he didn’t have money), I just wanted him to be the first to wish me happy birthday. He did exactly that—set an alarm for midnight, and I was honestly really happy with that.\n\nThen his birthday came the following month.

I just listened because my financial situation has been rough (I’m the breadwinner of my family since my dad left us with debt, and money has been very tight).\n\nOn his birthday, I wished him happy birthday. His reaction felt kind of… disappointed. Two days later, he asked me directly, “So what are you going to give me for my birthday?” I was shocked and said I didn’t know. Then he sent me a link about a girl who bought her boyfriend an expensive gift and said, “She bought her boyfriend something expensive, but my girlfriend didn’t even get me something cheap.”\n\nThat really hurt. I reminded him that I didn’t get anything on my birthday either, and I never demanded anything. I could’ve compared him to my exes who gave me gifts without asking, but I never did, because I don’t care about that.\n\nWhen I told him maybe he should just date someone richer, he got mad and said, “I don’t need material things.” But it feels like he does—otherwise, why bring it up and compare me to other girlfriends? Meanwhile, he still relies on his parents and even gets gifts from them, while I get nothing and carry all my family responsibilities.\n\nNow I can’t shake the thought: is he just trying to use me financially in the long run? Because honestly, the item he wanted was actually quite expensive in my country’s currency.\n\nTL;DR: My LDR boyfriend didn’t give me anything on my birthday (which was fine), but when his came around, he was disappointed I didn’t buy him a gift and compared me to girlfriends who spend big on their boyfriends.

I used to be very jealous when we first got together for 2 reasons — 1, I was extremely insecure from an old relationship and prior weight gain, and 2, he had no filter because his last relationship the woman he was with didn’t ever get jealous.\n\nOne thing to note is I’m bi, I appreciate a good looking woman but I’m more attracted to men. That being said I don’t make a huge deal of every male celebrity I’m attracted to. My boyfriend was different and would speak explicitly about the women he liked, maybe because I’m bi he thought I’d like it? I don’t. For example, talking about a Marvel movie would lead to him talking about how sexy Scarlett Johansson is. Look, I get it, but I don’t need to know, if that makes sense.\n\nOnce when we were talking about the movie Knocked Up he said he just couldn’t get into it. Fair enough but I tried explaining how it’s an interesting look at relationship dynamics and he immediately launched into “I couldn’t get past how Seth Rogen was with Kathryn Heigl, who I always thought was sexy as fuck.” Dude.

I was in the process of putting away dishes and likened her to Sofia Vergara on Modern Family, but said I liked that character better.

So, over the past year I've become friends with Naomi (34F) and really value our relationship. A few months ago, she started hanging out with Irene (29F) and the two of them seemed to become close very quickly. I had met Irene in group settings before, but a month ago we hung out one on one for the first time. Irene and I spent a whole day together and I enjoyed spending time with her. After I posted some pictures on social media, Naomi messaged me with a warning to be careful around Irene. I don't know all the details, but apparently Naomi told Irene some personal things about herself and Irene broke Naomi's trust by revealing what Naomi told her to another friend of hers. Irene apologized, but Naomi doesn't want anything to do with her anymore.\n\n  \nThe thing is, I trust Naomi's telling the truth and I value my relationship with her more than I value my relationship with Irene. I've never had a bad experience with Irene, but I know people have different sides to them. I've also been victim to having someone treat me poorly, but our mutual friends didn't believe me because the person harming me was supposedly too nice to do such a thing. So, I wouldn't want to dismiss Naomi just because I've only ever seen Irene be nice around me.\n\n  \nBut I feel like I'm in a difficult spot now. I don't even think Irene knows I'm aware of the situation with Naomi and if I mention it to her then that'll reveal Naomi's been talking to me about it. And I wouldn't want to make things harder for Naomi by doing that of course. So Irene's just messaging me like everything's normal. I could act cool around Irene, let the relationship fade and try to make it seem natural. I know two of my friends don't necessarily have to be friends with each other, but I'd still feel wrong and like I'm not doing right by Naomi if I just act like Irene didn't do anything to hurt her.\n\n\n\nThe main difficulty for me is that I'm even closer with Irene's other friends, none of whom I think are aware of the situation. So if there are group events I'm likely to see Irene again and I don't feel like I can talk to our mutual friends about the situation if they pick up that I'm acting cool around Irene. And I suppose it would be really awkward if Irene picks up how I'm acting around her. Has anyone experienced anything like this?

Then somehow we started flirting and exchanging explicit photos and messages. Eventually I developed some feelings for him and realized that around May or June. In August he told me he's dating a woman, but they're not exclusive and they both don't want commitment. Since they're not exclusive I decided to tell him I like him. He made weird boundaries, like explicit messages would be crossing boundaries but he still likes my explicit pictures and call me hot etc. Yesterday I've sent him a Tiktok that said something like \"praying for people who think you can have a true connection with someone you met online and never met in real life\". I've sent it more as a joke and he took it seriously and said that I \"needed that 10000000%\". It made me sad, his behavior in general makes me upset since he's giving me a lot of mixed signals. I'm also sad that he's not really in a relationship with her but won't find any time to even text me back during the day.  He thinks that I'm being weird for being upset at all. I don't know what to do with this whole situation. Should I just stop talking to him? Can this be dealt with in any other way?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Initially, as we discussed it we were both open to the idea of moving in together. She lives alone in a 1BR apartment but we would find a 2br since I would need an extra room for my office. Now, as we approach it in two months, she suggested we do a trial move in by me staying at her place for an extended period of time instead of immediately moving in together. \n\nI’m not against the idea, but it concerns me that she’s suddenly creating what feels like distance. She previously moved in with her partner after 6 months and she said it felt like they just became roommates so she’s afraid that will happen with us too. She also stated that she’s concerned that the LDR is what keeps our infatuation high and if we are dating locally our connection may not be as strong. To me it sounds like she’s unsure of our relationship.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I address this?

Thankfully, a complete stranger found her and she ended up in hospital, rather than a mortuary. \n\nAfter contacting her mother, I was given the hospital's phone number and I called her every day for two weeks in the early hours of the morning to make sure she was okay and so she knew someone out there loved her. As the date of her discharge got closer, she got happier knowing we could spend more time together and at the prospect of visiting in a couple of months.\n\nWhile trying to find out if she was okay, I contacted her best friend (who I had not contacted before) to let her know she went missing, then gave her the room number and phone to call if she wanted to visit or talk.\n\nThe day she was discharged we talked a little. She had returned to a life full of people not angry, just disappointed with her. After I woke up today, she told me she had a serious question, \"would you be okay without me, if you knew I was alive in the world?\" I did not know how to respond to that.\n\nHer friend had given her an ultimatum: she could stay with her and continue her job on the condition that she cut contact with me and our mutual friends for reasons I don't understand at all.\n\nWhat followed was an agonising conversation for both of us. We both still love each other, that is blindingly obvious. We were both in tears the whole time. She could not name a single bad thing I'd done in the six months we've known each other, and the only reason she could think of for breaking up was that she might make me sad in the future because she sees herself as a burden. After an hour of calling, she could not physically talk anymore and hung up. Hearing my voice upset her too much. She felt a tremendous amount of guilt. \"I want the person I love to be happy,\" she said. \"You're the best boyfriend I've ever had,\" she said. \"You have to let go.\" My pleas for her to stay fell on deaf ears.\n\nShe promised to email me every once in a while.\n\nI don't know what to do with the care package I got her.

What I do admit though is that I definitely have insecurities, and sometimes I get scared that he might “disrespect” me which is ridiculous.

Usually it’s either uni stuff or potential work opportunities etc. the only regular is one of his friends girlfriends and I’ve met her before.

I know I’m not scared of him cheating cause I felt relief that they were mutuals rather than him one sidedly following her for example. I’m just scared and I’d like to see other people’s perspectives and just situations where having girl friends in your boyfriend didn’t end up with a bad ending you know?

We have been dating for 3 years and are both getting very tired of the distance and want to start our lives together.

He still has the option for the Arraigo Social since he has lived and worked there for several years but the hardest part is getting a job contract with a company that will sponsor his new visa. I wish there was some way we could close the gap in a new country together with a fresh start. The U.S. doesn’t seem like a safe option with the way they are handling immigration lately and rising prices. He also said Morocco has a poor quality of life unless you are well off, and he doesn’t have job prospects there.

I drove 18 hours just to get to him, and we spent good 6 1/2 days together (5 full days). \n\nSince the very first moment of having him close by my side everything felt divinely magical. We both had the best time of our lives, we were each other's first ever kiss, cuddle and so on.\n\nSeeing his smile, seeing him happy, being there for him, being able to hug him tightly, cuddle him, kiss him at any occasion, and comforting him when he didn't feel good was just so wonderful. We created lifelong good memories together, and we both say that this week was the best time of our lives.\n\nNow, the last 2 days before me having to leave, some tears started flowing because of me having to leave him. Both me and him mutually cried about it, thinking that the time spent together felt so short - it passed so quickly. I comforted him, he comforted me, but as the time got less and less, both me and him started feeling more sad by the hour.\n\nThe last moments where we both waited for my bus to arrive to bring me back home were devastating. We cried like waterfalls, and the moments that are stuck within my mind the most are the few minutes as the bus arrived. As soon as the bus drove on the stop, we both started sobbing uncontrollably. I had to go into the bus and I wanted to look at him for as long as possible, so I looked at him crying, reaching his hand out to me. I said one last \"I love you\", as he had to go, visibly crying, and slowly disappearing behind people, darkness and buildings.\n\n  \nThough the time spent together was perfect, I can not forget the good bye. It made me cry for a good hour in the bus, and I still feel deeply melancholic having to think about it. \n\nThe only good thing is that we will meet each other in a little bit more than three months, so the wait won't be too long.

I am so anxious just thinking about starting to type this. It is a long story. \n\n\nI (25F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been through a lot. We are long distance and he emotionally cheated on me for 4 months with a past short lived situation. This girl also happens to be his mom’s best friend’s daughter. After I found out, he was open and told his mom. Instead of being mad at him for emotionally cheating, she was mad at me for the way I found out ( going thru his phone and reading journal entry about his girl) ad well as bad mouthing me for other things he told her ( He was considering dropping out of college and she blamed me ). I sent her a DM ( her and I have Dm’d before but not often at all) explaining many things and how I have never encouraged him to drop out. After she read my message, she liked it and then blocked me, my business acount and my mom’s business account a couple days later. She even ‘ remove this follower’ to her son. I truly tried to be respectful when I reached out. I have never wanted anything but then kind of in law family connection that we all dream off. I have orchestrated so many family activities whenever I visit her home, family is big to me. \n\nOver the next several months, he and I worked through our issues and he told me he wanted to take our relationship to the next level and close the gap and test and true close distance relationship.\n\nDuring that time, she continued to try to convince him to stay in contact with the woman he cheated with, even in the week before he moved. She bad mouthed me BADDDD. I was banned from her house, she said I would “ She is going to work you like a slave to keep up with her life style, she will eat shit if her mother ever died. She doesnt know how to live without just begging for things and using her mom’s credit card”( completely false, she and my mom are both business owners and she has met my mom several time so idk how she thinks that way of us, his mom is high high maintenance ) \n\nThen, five months after she blocked me, AN HOUR BEFORE WE WERE SET TO LEAVE his state ( I flew in so we could road trip in his car) , his mom unblocked me and sent a long, warm message apologizing for not replying sooner. \n\nShe said she needed time to find the right words, framed her silence as being out of love for her son, and wished us happiness. She also invited me to her house to give me a hug before we left.\n\nThe problem: she did NOT acknowledge blocking me, banning me from her house, speaking badly about me, ETC! Her “apology” blamed her silence on being emotional about her son leaving, not on her actions toward me. It felt manipulative, self-serving, and incomplete and it triggered massive anxiety. My stomach twisted, I cried, and my heart raced just reading it.\nI want to protect my boundaries and demand real accountability, not be manipulated into accepting a non-apology. She is literally like the queen bee of his household and everyone just deals with her BS. My bf even told one of his brother what she has done and the brother said “ That is sociopathic behavior. You should go.”\n\nMy bf’s mom isnt the only issue, he is too bc he is so close to her that he sometimes is wishy washy with being neutral with and being on her side vs giving me the space I need after I was completely abused and traumatized by her. So he sees her message as an olive branch and wants me to accept it; he even said that if nothing smoothes over, he’d rather I didn’t go home with him for his  birthday (October 13). My parents are split on advice: my mom says I should send a measured message asking if his mom is willing to talk, and my dad says to ignore her entirely and let him handle his mother himself.\nI don’t want to make the first move for either of them. This is about my feelings and seeking justice for myself. I’m not willing to back down or accept empty words, and I don’t trust his mom to be accountable ( or at all lol) . At the same time, I want to support my bf, show up for him and assert dominance in his life as we are in a serious relationship but I’m terrified of being manipulated or forced into being the “bigger person” in front of his family when that women hurt me BAD.\nMy questions:\n* idk if should go to his birthday whether or not things are resolved?\n* If I do go, how do I maintain boundaries and make it clear I will not accept a fake apology?\n* If I don’t go, how do I explain it to my bf in a way that protects my dignity and boundaries without making him feel punished?\n\nTDLR:\n\nBoyfriend emotionally cheated. His mom blocked me for 5 months, badmouthed me, and banned me from her house. She finally unblocked me right before we left his state and sent a vague “apology” that didn’t acknowledge her actions. I want accountability, not manipulation. His birthday is coming up, idk what my next step\nShould be?

At that time she said she didn't talk with another dudes, and it turned out she talked with someone even had sexual convos per phone nudes etc. but the problem isn't that she talked with someone, the problem is that she lied about that in the first place. I was asking questions and after some time she said that she lied. After that, I broke up with her because of trust issues.\n\nShe texted me after a while, had a big apology and we started over.\n\nAfter some months she broke up with me again because she went to college, and she said “long distance doesn't work out for me” and I heard from her myself that she went regularly clubbing getting drunk there went on a date even.\n\nShe said she hasn't been with anyone. After that she begged me to come back non-stop for almost half a year, and now I'm back with her, but the issue is I can't trust her. I really want to but i can't.\n\nas an example she said she is at a PC Café like we call it here she was playing Valorant with her girlfriends and I checked the teammates she had because I have paranoia.\n\nShe said she is out with the girls, but even then I can't trust her because of the past, I always think they are some dudes with her.\n\nSo the biggest problem I have here is that she broke my trust AND she doesn't respect my boundaries.\n\nShe says u can't have female friends, but she has male friends from college. I'm honestly a good-looking dude, and she says u can't wear compression shirts because its too revealing. And I said “ok u can wear everything u like except this piece because it's a bit TOO much IMO”, but today she wears it and said ups sorry forgot.\n\nShe had summer holidays and since she is back at college she texts me at 12am at night stays for 5 minutes and lefts. i know she is a social person but just write me 5 minutes daily and go to bed really? She follows dudes, but she always asks about the girls who i follow. Then she resists me to unfollow them but when i ask about the dude she is following (after she asks ofc) she just says they are just dudes from the college i talk about exams.\n\nI don't want to lose her because i love her and i don't want her to be with another man but i can't stand it anymore. The releationship feels like a one sided one.\n\nAm i the problem?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Advice needed.\n\nHey Reddit, I need some outside perspective on my long-distance relationship because I'm starting to feel crazy.\n\nMy (34M) girlfriend (29F) lives in Spain and I live abroad. We've been together for a while (more than 3 years together) and I’m mostly doing all the travelling as I’m more flexible and earn more than she does. For the last year, the plan was decided for me to move to her but sometimes I have my doubts due to quality of work, lack of support network, etc. She is willing to move in the future, but she cannot do that now due to her work.\n\nLately, she's been frustrated that my job search in Spain hasn't been moving as quickly as she'd like. I'll be honest, it's been hard to find the motivation. It's a huge move, leaving my job/family/friends behind is daunting, and the job market is tough. I'm committed, but I'm struggling with the pace.\n\nHere's the current issue: Her friend is having a birthday party in Spain soon, and I really wanted to go. It's a chance to see her and her friends and feel connected to my future life there. I told her I was planning to book a flight and attend the party.\n\nShe got angry and told me that she doesn’t want me to come to the party. Her reasoning is that if I use my money and time to fly over for a \"fun trip,\" it takes away the urgency for me to find a job and move. She says it's a \"waste\" and that I should only come when I have a job secured. She also outright refuses to visit me here for the same reason—to \"force\" me to be the one to make the move.\n\nI feel like this is incredibly manipulative. She's using a fun event I was excited about as a punishment to pressure me into acting faster. It feels less like she's my partner and more like she's my manager withholding a reward.\n\nOn one hand, I get her frustration. She wants us to live in the same country and feels I'm not moving fast enough. On the other hand, I feel like her method is controlling and is making me more resistant and anxious about the entire move, not less.\n\nSo, Reddit, is her tactic a normal level of frustration in a long-distance relationship, or is it a major red flag?\n\nTL; DR: My GF in Spain is forbidding me from visiting her for a friend's birthday party. She says it's to \"force\" me to focus on finding a job there so I can move, instead of taking fun trips. She also refuses to visit me for the same reason. I think it's manipulative.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We’ve been together for 3 years, and for the last 2 years we’ve been long-distance.\n\nWe met in early 2022 at a wedding, got close through mutual friends, and started dating that June. Things moved fast — we were deeply in love and spent most of our time together. By December we even introduced each other to our families, and everyone loved us. My dad even joked I had to marry her.\n\nThen, in January 2023, she told me she had been accepted to a university in Canada. I was completely shocked. She had once mentioned that living in Canada was her “dream,” but I had no idea she was actually applying. I’ve always said I would never do long distance again, so I felt blindsided and betrayed.\n\nWe fought for weeks. Later, I discovered she had also already received a **5-year visa**, and her family thought I had known all along. It crushed me that she was planning such a huge move in secret while we were building a future together.\n\nShe broke down crying, admitted she was wrong, and said she only kept it secret because she feared I’d leave her. She promised she would just study for one year and come back for me. Eventually, I forgave her and said I’d try. She swore there would be no more secrets.\n\nShe left for Canada a month later. Because of her immigration situation, if she leaves Canada she can’t return, so she hasn’t been able to visit. Meanwhile, I’m still in South Africa — my visa renewal is delayed, and I haven’t had luck finding overseas sponsorship jobs as a software developer.\n\nIt’s now been 2 years. We talk every day, and emotionally we’re closer than ever. But I miss her so much. My main love language is physical touch, and the distance is draining me. I’ve stayed loyal and resisted temptation, but it’s hard.\n\nRecently we’ve been discussing our future. She wants to stay in Canada to build a career. I told her I can’t put my life on hold forever and that if she comes back, we can get married and build a life together — but I can’t keep doing long distance. She said if she comes back, it’ll be only for me, but she needs time to decide.\n\nI love her deeply, but I’m tired of the uncertainty.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Recently, she broke up with me because she felt I was being controlling/manipulative (I’d get upset when she hung out with friends, she felt like she had to walk on eggshells, etc). She said she loved me but not the same way anymore, and that her mental health was being affected.\n\nIn her breakup message she said things like:\n\n* “As far as I feel right now, I don’t want to have a relationship with you anymore.”\n* “Maybe after a long few months we can hangout casually.”\n* “We both need time to heal and figure out what to do with our lives.”\n\nI respected her wishes and planned to go no-contact.

He was planning to get into MBA since last year, luckily he got into a good college and left in June, and we're in LDR since then. We decided we'll meet as soon as he gets his internship finalised which will be in October first week, because MBA is quite busy and the first few months are really challenging and important. I've battled depression for a long time, but since he has appeared, he has always been absolutely amazing at being there for me and taking care of the small things even though he's far. He is a pretty optimistic person and keeps telling me we've a future together even though I get cynical at times. Overall I feel safe and happy being with him, and I feel we can thrive together. \n\nBut lately something has been bugging me. He isn't very quick at opening upto people so at his college he has made a sole female friend so far. I always felt that lady had her eyes on him, but he kept reassuring me that she doesn't, and always emphasized on how she's the only one he can talk to. He does have some male friends as well but he says they aren't very good at understanding emotions. \nThere was one time when I called him and he said he's studying with people and we disconnected call. 15-20mins later he called me again and said he was studying with that girl, and he lied because he felt I would be angry if I got to know. He then promised he won't repeat it and we didn't talk about it again. But I could never really let that out of my mind and always felt uneasy about it.\n\nRecently he told me that other students have been teasing that girl by pairing her and my boyfriend together, and that she was frustrated because of that. Then he said she asked him to meet and talk, where she told him that she ACTUALLY had a thing for him. My boyfriend told me he cut off the friendship with her, because being friends meant giving her hope. \nAfter that day, he's been very annoyed and told me multiple times that he feels alone now, because his only friend is gone, but at the same time he can't talk to her either because he doesn't want to give her hope. I tell him that he can always talk to other friends, and he agrees, but then comes back to feeling lonely again. He says he's sad it had to turn out like this because that girl isn't a bad person. Since the last 3 days we haven't spoken as much because he's always annoyed, and if we talk, this situation is all we have talked about. And I am really not sure how to deal with this because in my head I know it's something that can happen with anyone and I have been trying my best to give him the comforting words and be as understanding as possible, but it keeps bugging me how he keeps talking about it and nothing else when he talks. He says he doesn't have any romantic feelings for her at all and that I've nothing to worry about but seeing how disoriented he has been ever since the incident, I don't know anymore how should I feel about it. \n\nAm I overthinking this?

We’ll say it quietly at the end of a call. He did it first but I think it was an accident. I’ll whisper it before he hangs up but like, should I wait until we’re in person to have that conversation or should I just do it? I’m really tired of saying “I adore you” and “I care about you” when I LOVE him. \n\n\nI really don’t want to freak him out. Can you even love someone after 6 months of knowing them? I don’t have much dating experience, please be respectful. 😭", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Leading up to the day, he seemed consistent and promising over text. I was genuinely excited and put time into getting ready — I wore an olive green silk dress, comfy heels, and a leather coat since it’s chilly here in South Africa right now.\n\nWe agreed he’d pick me up at 6 PM, but he only showed up at 6:40 and was unreachable until then. When he arrived, he was dressed very casually (definitely not “dinner date” ready). The first thing he said was, “Wow, you really prepared.” I expressed that I value time and respect, but he brushed off my concern and said I was acting like it was the end of the world.\n\nInstead of heading to dinner, he told me he had an appointment at 8 PM and wouldn’t be able to go through with our plans. Since I was already dressed up, he suggested we just get takeout instead. We drove to a pizza place, but while waiting for the order, he tried to touch me inappropriately, even after I told him to stop.\n\nWhen we got back to my apartment building, he parked in a darker corner and tried to force himself on me again. I pushed him away, grabbed my things, and left. He later kept calling and saying he “missed me,” which I found mind-boggling after what happened. I blocked him.\n\nThe next morning, I cried. Not because of him specifically, but because I felt so defeated about dating in general. I know one bad man doesn’t define my future, but experiences like this make it really hard to stay optimistic.\n\nI’m sharing this not to trauma dump, but because I think it’s important for men to realize how common and discouraging these experiences can be for women. Dating today feels incredibly difficult, and I don’t want this to shape me, but it has definitely left me wary.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Stacy had talked to her and she said that the woman “Cindy” thought that I was cute. So next time we were there I talked to Cindy, and I got her number. Stacy told me after that Cindy really enjoyed our conversation and was excited to go out. So we went on a double date. Stacy had also warned me that Cindy hadn’t dated in 4 years and her last relationship was really bad. So I should take it slow. So I did, I was really respectful, I made sure she was comfortable the whole time and I didn’t make any moves on her. \n\nThe date was probably the best date I’ve ever had.

So I was feeling pretty good about things. \n\nWe kept texting and I did notice a drop off. She maybe texted me 1/3 of the amount she used to. She then sent me a message saying she wanted to start out as friends and then she canceled our second date saying she had to do something with her roommate, and didn’t really respond when I asked her to lmk when she’d be freed up again. I spoke with Stacy last night and she said that Cindy had been saying that she was nervous to go out again. That she felt like the date went too good.

About a month ago, I matched with a guy on Hinge (31M). Both of our profiles said we were looking for a long-term relationship. Our first convo got flirty, and I made it clear I wasn’t looking to mess around casually. He told me he understood and was genuinely into me. For our first date, he drove 1.5 hours to take me out to dinner. We had amazing chemistry, fun conversation, and we ended up hooking up. I hadn’t had sex in almost a year and I wanted to — no regrets. I am not someone who attaches after sex, and it was amazing. The next day he texted saying he had a great time, that I’m amazing and “was worth a 12 hr drive.”  We texted every single day, and he came back the next week. We had dinner, watched a movie, spent about 8 hours together. I made it very clear that I only am physical with people if I’m exclusive. He said I’d made that clear, that thinks I’m special, has never met anyone like me, and likes me. He also got weirdly jealous when I mentioned an ex, saying he didn’t want to hear about exes or people I’d slept with. We texted heavily every day, lots of flirting, things like “you’re worth waiting for” (we didn't see each other for a week), \"You’re hot and smart and sexy, “you’re too pretty to be sad.” We were joking, complimenting each other, and even talking about cuddling/spooning/sleeping next to each other. It felt like he was leaning into couple-y territory — saying he wanted to see me, that he liked me. At one point I told him I wasn’t used to having such an immediate attraction and didn’t usually come on so strong (as we both were), and he told me he loved it and wanted me to keep it up.\n\nWe planned to see each other Saturday, and I told him my Friday plans had fallen through so we could see each other both days. Out of nowhere, he texts me: “[my name], what do you think is the end goal with us?” I asked him to call, and on the phone he told me:\n\n• He’s had a hard time with relationships this past year.\n\n• He doesn’t feel like he wants to be in anything committed.\n\n• He likes me and thinks I’m amazing, but “pretty much knows” it won’t turn serious.\n\n• He didn’t want to hurt me if I wanted something serious. I told him that all I was asking for was spending time together and getting to know each other. I wasn’t asking for marriage or for him to be my boyfriend. He said that he “couldn’t say with 100% certainty that things wouldn’t go further.” I said flat out that I didn't want to be with someone who didn't want to be with me, and he got frustrated and said that's not what was happening.\n\nThis was confusing because his profile says “looking for long term.” From the beginning I was clear that I wasn’t looking to just mess around, and he said he understood and was into me. He told me he hasn’t been seeing or sleeping with anyone else, it’s just me.\n\nI told him my only goal right now was to keep spending time together and see where it goes, but it sounded like he was saying he knew he wasn’t that into me. He insisted that wasn’t the case. I asked if he was unsure about what would happen, or if he knew it wouldn’t be serious — he said he wasn’t sure. But he also wouldn’t make a clear decision either way. Finally I told him I wasn’t going to make the call for him, but that I don’t think he would’ve brought this up if he didn’t already know what he wanted. He agreed. So I said goodbye and hung-up.\n\nI don't know why people do this. He was laying it on thick with the flirting, compliments, and physical intimacy talk, then pulled back as soon as it started to feel real.

Ive been texting this guy for a few months and I feel like I have been pretty heavily leading this guy on, I don’t dismiss any of his attempts to flirt and sometimes when I simply dont know what to say or feel bad to say no I agree. Even whenever he asks to see eachother soon I say I miss him too and agree to meeting up and then when the time comes I make up an excuse. I really dont like him but I feel terrible especially now when its gotten this far. I genuinely dont think I have ever broken things off with anyone or really delivered bad news on my behalf because I feel so bad for the other person. I dont mean to mess with people like this I really dont.  In all honesty I’ve thought about ghosting him but that seems worse on his end and I worry about ending up in a situation where I happen to see him later after that. I know I need to be honest but I dont know how to go about it. Should we stay friends after?? I feel like saying I dont want to even be friends will give him the impression I never even enjoyed knowing him, yk?

During that move, I decided to do a software engineering bootcamp.\n\nIt’s been about a year since I’ve had a job, and I’m honestly so tired of being jobless. I gave software engineering a try, but I realized it’s not for me. On top of that, I have a lot of limiting beliefs:\n\t•\tI don’t have a bachelor’s degree in computer science\n\t•\tI’m a foreigner\n\t•\tTech is in a down cycle right now\n\nAll of this made it really hard for me, and eventually, I gave up on pursuing it.\n\nSo, we moved back to my home country and now I’m looking for work again. The good news is I am getting interviews, but the bad news is that I feel like I’m emotionally draining my fiancé.\n\nHe’s been really supportive; he built a whole spreadsheet with me to track applications, outreach, and coffee chats. He believes networking is the most important thing right now, but I really struggle with coffee chats. I don’t enjoy them, and because of that, I haven’t prioritized them. This frustrates him a lot, and we end up in big arguments. He feels like I’m not trying hard enough when I don’t follow the process the way he suggests.\n\nFrom my side, I am trying but when he breaks down my process, it makes me feel like I’m constantly falling short. Mentally, I’m not okay. I don’t feel like the same person he fell in love with, and I know this whole situation is tiring for him too.\n\nAnother big issue is that he has told me he doesn’t feel comfortable going into marriage with me right now because he feels I’m not consistent and he just feels like I’m not reliable and what if we have kids and i can’t pull my own weight like do research for schools etc . he’s brought up a prenup multiple times. I don’t mind signing it, but it really hurts me that things have gotten to this stage in our relationship because of my career struggles and the way I do things spills over \n\nMoney isn’t a huge issue since he’s financially stable, but I also don’t want to just sit around doing nothing.\n\nI guess my main question is: How do I navigate this dynamic without damaging our relationship? How do I balance his accountability system with my own way of doing things, when I feel so mentally drained? And how do I process the fact that my career struggles are now affecting our marriage discussions?\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR: Quit my job, moved abroad with fiancé, tried a software engineering bootcamp but gave up. Now back home, job hunting again, and fiancé wants me to network heavily (coffee chats, spreadsheets, etc.) while I feel drained and resistant. He’s also said he doesn’t feel comfortable marrying me right now because of my job search consistency and has brought up a prenup multiple times.

We had a strong attraction, great chemistry, and some amazing moments together but there were also repeated arguments and patterns that left me unsettled.\n\nSome examples:\n\nWithin the first few weeks of dating she pulled me up on my messaging consistency, saying I messaged her differently on weekends and she found it “disrespectful”.\n\nI had travelled to another country for work and she started an argument because I didn’t messaged her as soon as I landed (I had poor signal, had to urgently catch a train and was planning on messaging her as soon as I had time).

She pleaded with me not to end things, saying she’s “not normally like this” and I’d regret giving up on her.

She seemed more accepting than I expected, even mature about it, but I can’t shake feelings of guilt. She clearly cared about me, and I did care about her. But I also feel relief now that it’s over, which tells me something too.\n\nMy question is: Did I do the right thing by ending this, or was I too sensitive/not giving enough grace for her stress?\n\nTL;DR: Dated for 4 months, strong chemistry but repeated conflicts (messaging frequency, Instagram post, not texting right after landing, even kicked me in bed after a joke).

Im (27M) and my girlfriend is (29F) we've been together for over 7 years, and recently she broke up with me and has feelings dor someone else and it's all my fault. \n\nHere is the context and full story:\n\nWe met when we were very young, she came from a bad house and i came from a emotionaly stable house. As such when we met i was the emotional support she needed to get trough the hardest years of her life. I was very fit at the time, and very social but then Covid hit. At that time we lived together at my grandfathers house as it was a small house with 2 floors. I was employed at a steady job, a perfect entry level position with infinite chances to advance and the pay was good i also advance to a Level 2 position. She was studying law at the time and it was a very hard period for her, we both had so much potential and life was good and momentum was high. \n\nBut then i made my first mistake as we transitioned to working from home i became lazy, complacent, stopped working out, stopped wanting to advance in my carrier as i felt it was enough because i fell into the comfort zone. During that time she was finishing her studies getting a better job and fighting for all hell to break trough a corrupt system to build a career. For context she had a near perfect GPA. During all that i became lazyer and fatter i loved the idea that i could finaly play videogames that i couldn't play before it was everything i did. At some point near the end of Covid i realised what i had become i went from 76kg of near pure muscle to 96Kg od pure fat. During this entire time, she would beg me to start working out again to be more ambitious to finish my drivers license and i just scoffed at the advice. As she went up, i went down and i dragged her down with me. \n\nI eventually became disgusted with myself once reaching the 96kg mark, and started slowly implementing a better diet as i had years of prior knowledge. I finished an IFBB certification for a nutritionist to have even more success in my journey. And i acctually did it, i came back from obesity and that gave her hope that i would change. In some ways i did but i still wasn't interested in advancing my career or getting a drivers license. During this time we got a big chunk of money from a relative to buy an apartment for the two of us. This was before prices skyrocketed, i was picky and missed the opportunity and hoped that they would go down (i was a naive kid) the money sat and lost value for years while waiting for the prices to go down. The second floor house that we lived in was not a place to live or raise a family, it had roches, it was filthy, we tried to maintain a clean living space but it just wasn't possible. Soon we moved back in with my parents and that's when everything started going downhill. \n\nMy parents are loving and caring but they are lazy, sloppy and not ambitious, my dad would finish his job and just stare at the TV all day, my mom would spend countless hours arguing on facebook, they sort of coexist, they never leave the house and it's only clean when someone comes over which is never. The house would constantly smell of cat food and feces as my parents left the cat sand and food in the hallway. Needless to say i was like them in a sence and she finally saw that it was a problem with how i was raised no ambition was ever implanted into me, just mediocrity.\n\nShe was genuinely unhappy in the relationship but she forced herself to stay as she loves me deeply and saw my infinite potential. She would eventually pull me up and build me into the person that i am today. But that took a toll. She is also very shy. Not only that but as my folks were slobs she would never feel like she could comfortably use the bathroom or go to the kitchen to make something to eat, i would constantly have to close doors, bring her food and such. As a result of me being used to and enjoying a routine and her not feeling comfortable in my parents house, the spark faded even further. I would improve on one thing and give her hope, then slow down and she would have to pull me up. Again taking a toll on her, as she focused on bringing me up i honestly beleive thst slowed down her career. \n\nAs she was picky i let her always pick a place where we would go out simply as i didn't really care what the place was. When we would go to a vacation (traveling is very important to her) i let her choose as i didn't know much as i never traveled with my parents, again out of best intentions as i knew it happened once a year and i wanted her to enjoy. Those good intentions kind ofnspiraled into a sence of fear to choose something as i didn't want to disappoint. In the end my carelessness, cowardace, the routine way of life, her constantly pulling me up and my stubbornness led to the spark fading heavily and her feeling like she is the man in the relationship. You see as she comes from a bad home she always yearned for a stable, mature partner, she wanted to feel safe and protected but i wasn't that. She would constantly be afraid of our relationship ending up like my parents, never going out, sitting in seperate rooms, no love, just coexistence. I hated that my parents instilled in me and deeply rooted their bad habits and actively fought against them. It felt like fighting myslef and i despised myself for it. I would come back to my old ways sometimes, but as time went on that happened less and less, i was fighting it off. \n\nShe would of course get hit up by guys but she would shut them down as she loves me deeply. But the years of forcing herself to stay with me as she saw potential thst never got realised took a heavy toll, the spark was gone. She would lash out at the smallest things and then eat herself alive as that's not how she wants to behaive and she knew i didn't deserve that. The constant small fights would chip away until everything was gone. \n\nDuring the years i did fight off my bad habits i was making steady progress and that sense of hope is what kept her going. I would constantly fight off my fathers implanted bad habits and actively told her im not like that and she saw i was fighting it. The final nail in the coffin was when we went with her aunt to a spring, instead of spending time and having fun i spent most of the time on my phone, i was lazy, not interested in much, just relaxing with occasional walks. As that reminded her of my father all the fears came back. As we are at a family starting age, specially her, she couldn't find a way to trust me anymore. And that eventually manifested in her falling in love with someone else, someone that had all the qualities i lacked. She feels guilt and is conflicted about her feelings on one hand she has feelings for someone else, but yet she deeply loves me and just wanted to spend her life with me but couldn't trust that i was changing into what she needed\n\nWe had our final talk about trying to save our relationship 2 days ago during our trip to Greece. She couldn't trust me anymore that i could become the person she needs and we broke up.The irony in the entire story i did grow into the person she needs, hell im on the verge of being everything she needed.  Over the past 6 months alone I finally found and bought a home and a good one, im in the middle of getting my drivers license, 15 more practical classes and i can get the license, im actively studying and applying for better positions and am trying to climb the corporate ladder, i used my IFBB nutritionist certification to set everything up to start a private business on the side as soon as i move into my new home (my parents home is not a good place to set up a food based business as you might guess), im more attentive and take more responsibilities. As my grandfather unfortunately passed, i work near every weekend to renovate house so we can rent it out. Unfortunately my current schedule doesn't allow me to go more. I now have the hunger of ambition that she tried to wake up for years. But due to her previous experience with my fathers implanted bad habits she can't bring herself to trust me to become something when she fell in love with someone that can provide stability and safety, it would be a huge risk due to my past bad pattern of habits. I don't blame her, not in the slightest she has to put herself first after years of trying to make something out of me but god does it hurt. \n\nShe never wanted things to go this way, it ate her up that she had feelings for him when she loves me more than she loved anyone else. In the end she said she doesn't love him, she loves me, but she doesn't want to be with me in a romantic way with the person that i am now. I told her that i love her more than i love anyone else and that i cant expect her to wait for me, but that i will use these next few months to build myself into the person she needs and deserves i will build myself into someone who can make her feel safe and regain her trust trough actions not words and will come back for her. I don't want anyone else, the love that we built, the things we went trough together im not letting that slip away.\n\nNow with my entire lore out and about here come the questions:\n- While every long relationship is bound to end up in a routine in a sence, i hate that, i want to be more spontaneous as i was before, how can i reprogram my beain to do that?\n- What else can i do to show her i've changed once once I've completed all my goals or better yet how can i improve further?\n- How do i approach her again after i finish my goals for a second chance? \n\nPlease provide any ideas you have as it will mean a lot. \n\nI would like to point out we are still in Greece together im not gonna lie it's weird, but im focused on making fond memories with her and letting her enjoy her holiday, she needs it. \n\nIm definitely going to focus entirely on myself, my body, carrier, health, physical and mental and am going to see a psychologist for advice as well. I've already come far and will go even further. To confirm im not just doing this for her, i need to be better i want it more than ever, but damn me if i let the love of my life slip away.\n\nShe talked about our relationship with her family namely her aunt that witnessed me acting as my father on our trip, she also met him and was dumbfounded by how arrogant he is. I asked if she would be okay with me speaking to her and some of the other family members as they will be able to criticize me fully and i need that, i need to know what more i can improve. She smiled at the idea and gave me her number and blessing. \n\nIm not going back half baked, im giving it my all, the best version i can be for her. We are both rational and mature adults, we don't know if once i complete my goals, she will feel anything in a romantic way again. But everything that we've been trough is worth any struggle and even if norhing changes i will know i gave ir my all. I just hope that after all is said and done after we meet again she will feel the same way.\n\nTl:DR - my girlfriend is breaking up with me due to my previous lack of ambition and bad habits i picked up from my father, she needs to feel safe and secure as we are at a family starting age. I now am that person that can provide all of that, and very close to becoming even more but she can't trust words alone. Im going all out to win her back and need advice along the way.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We have a house, a cat and 2 small kids (3.5y and 1.5y) and love them to death. Together for 12.5y, married for 5y.\n\n**TL;DR**: Stuff has happened in the past, and I don't feel happy. However, I'm not sure whether it's just burnout/depression, or if I'm actually better off without her.\n\n**Full story** *(keep in mind this is just my side...)***:**\n\nFor me, problems started early in our relationship after she was secretly chatting with other men and even arranged to bring one to our apartment at the time, recommending me to go visit my parents during that time. I know she danced with and kissed the other man in a nightclub and they stayed in the apartment later. She swears nothing happened, as they both realized that it's a mistake and he then slept on the couch. However, this is not the story I initially heard, but what she told me this year. At first, it was more like \"he just sent me home and then left\". Now, I don't consider myself stupid and, honestly, I don't think I've heard everything. However, this was \\~10y ago and I don't think I really care anymore if anything happened. I am, however, a bit devastated to have found out I've been lied to all this time. We broke up for a bit, but got back together due to me being in a dark place and naive (I know, I know...).\n\nWe've had issues with physical closeness (sex as well, but not just that) for over 6y now. I've tried talking about it and seeing what I could do and/or change from my side. She has listened and seemingly cared, but nothing has changed. I'm definitely no expert, but it has felt like she could be asexual, since she has been completely fine with going multiple months without any sex.\n\nWe had planned for kids years in advance and when the time finally came, I told her that I don't think it's a good idea due to us having issues with physical closeness and this is something I need. Promises to change, yada yada... Voila, we now have 2 amazing children and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nWith the added stress of raising kids, whenever I've brought this topic up again, she has told me that it's hard for her after having kids. I feel I understand that as much as I can, and I've been patient. I'm an active dad and she has told me that she appreciates how much I play with and care for our kids. Of course I haven't been perfect either and I feel I could've given her even more time away from the kids. But, this isn't a new issue, since it was present long before we even had kids.\n\nThe last few years have been very stressful due to buying a house and decorating it, as well as doing **a lot** of work in the garden, all while raising 2 small kids. Now that the kids have grown up just a bit and go to kindergarten, I've discovered myself thinking about what I want. I don't feel happy and have doubts whether I truly can be happy in this marriage anymore... I feel like I've been the one holding us together and that I've been the \"comfortable\" choice. I feel I've been sort of neglected for a long time now, even though I've openly and calmly expressed my feelings and needs. Still, nothing has changed... Until now.\n\nMy wife noticed I've been \"off\" lately - more quiet, serious and sad. I told her that I don't think I've been happy in this relationship for years now and am thinking whether I want to continue. She was, of course, very sad to hear about this, and started asking about what's wrong. I told her the same that I've written here, and then some, and I've seen real change in her. She's suddenly very touchy-feely and initiates sex daily. However, I feel a bit indifferent about all of this... Why just now? Why not when I tried different ways and words to talk about this for years? However, after a few weeks I felt myself opening up a bit again.\n\nI had a feeling she might tell some of her friends about this situation, so I gave in and snooped a bit (yes, we have access to eachothers devices. And yes, I know it's wrong, but that's a separate topic). I saw a group chat with 2 of her girlfriends, where she didn't have one positive thing to say about me. All of this hurt me deeply, because **I know** that I'm not the person she made me out to be. I talked about this with her and asked why she felt the need to picture me in that light. She replied that she was looking for comfort and the best way she knew how to get that was to talk negatively. I understand that people often love drama and gossip, but this is your partner and the father of your children... This situation made my doubts even worse.\n\nI've been reading books and others' stories online. I've also been talking to a therapist and my dad about all of this. I would **love** to hear other peoples stories about similar situations.\n\nMy dad is divorced and now living with a new woman - said he's happy now. This was very good to hear, because he told me he hadn't felt happy for the last 16 years of his marriage with my mom (most of their marriage). He told me this about his marriage (rough translation): \"Once a soup has gone bad, you can heat it up again, but that won't make it good\". The difficult thing for me is, I can't be sure any decision I make is the right one. My dad also told me that I won't know until I find out. I feel this is a tough thing to \"find out\", as it's a life-changing decision, but I do agree with him.\n\nThankfully, we're both doing well in our careers: she makes \\~2x the average salary in our country, while I make \\~3x. What makes it harder is that I would never give up my kids, so anything less than 50/50 is not even an option for me, but she has told me that she couldn't do 50/50 as that's not enough for her. She also added that she doesn't feel like she would want to even get along with me if we were to divorce, and I feel that would devastate our kids (if not now, then later). I've always thought \"all relationships have problems\" and while I feel that's true, I still think I should feel happy...\n\nAm I just burnt out? Am I just looking for something new?\n\nOr am I truly feeling that this is not right? If so, is it worth throwing away everything we've built?\n\nOr should I try to fix everything again and risk feeling the same way sometime later in my life? I just don't want to ever say that I've been unhappy for 16 years, because hearing my dad say that broke my heart...", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/nihilscientia_1295", "user": "u/nihilscientia", "text": "Am I (M36) overreacting on finding out some truths about my fiancée (F30) on the beginning of our relationship?\n\n\n\nMe and my fiancée know each other as friends since 2021. On Sept. 3rd of 2023 we went out for lunch, it wasn't supposed to be a date, and ended hooking up that day. We had lots of talks about it for a couple of weeks because both of us felt it wasn't just a hookup but there was something more to it. On Sept. 14th she sent me the cutest audio saying she wasn't in the mood to just hookup, that she wasn't in that phase of her life, that she didn't want casual sex, and I fell in love with her when I heard it. It was some of the most beautiful things I heard in a long time. I was with some good friends when I heard the audio, they warned me about her feelings and not to screw it up and hurt her. Some backstory to their warning, I was *very* promiscuous during my single life and she knew about it as well. I'm extremely open about my life with my friends. From Sept. 14th onwards I stopped hooking up with other people, even calling off a threesome I had planned with two FWBs. I didn't tell her I had stopped hooking up with other people that day, I just wanted to be with her.\n\nOn Sept. 17th we hooked up again. Our hook ups weren't just casual sex or dates, we'd spend most of the day together when we could, like we were dating, even sleeping together in each other's home. We got together a few more days and around Sept. 27th I had to travel on business with another long time female friend. She mentioned being nervous about me going on a trip with her and was afraid we would hook up on the trip, so I asked her if she wanted exclusivity. She said she did and I told her I wanted to be exclusive too. On Sept. 30th she went to a party with her friends, this will be important later. Between Sept. 17th and Sept. 27th we were physically together for a total of five days but talking every day since Sept. 3rd. At this point she was calling my mother her mother in law and we had nicknames for each other. It very much felt like dating.\n\nI returned from my trip on Oct. 2nd and from that day onwards we were together pretty much daily. I asked her to be my girlfriend on Oct. 7th and she wasn't clear on her reply, but on Oct. 10th we formalized it and became boyfriend and girlfriend. One of our first serious talks was about me stopping contact with my ex girlfriend (who I dated for 10 years and was just a friend at that point) and former hook ups, even though I was very much exclusive with her, and on that day I deleted all my former contacts and blocked some of them. My former girlfriend was always hitting on me so I understood that need from her of going NC.\n\nFast forward two years later, we're recently engaged, she is with her sister and in the context of their talk she jokes with me about \"we're exclusive only when we started dating because when we hooked up we were free\" - and that did not sit well with me because to me we agreed on exclusivity when I traveled on business on Sept. 27th. On that same day I notice her scrolling Instagram and I saw her looking at two posts of people she had hooked up with in the past. I never talked to her about this boundary, but I felt like if I deleted all my former contacts then she would have done the same.\n\nAn important note here: I am not good at all with communication and feelings. I might just be autistic, in fact I'm currently investigating this with a therapist.\n\nThose two facts, her remark and her scrolling IG, were cooking up in me during the day and later that day I had a small panic attack and opened up with her. I told her I felt our relationship was asymmetrical because of it, that if she asked me to delete all my former contacts then she should've done the same as well without needing me to ask her. She agreed and proceeded to unfollow and block her former hook ups.\n\nThe remark was still bothering me and after a *long* discussion, about one month of it, some snooping on her phone (yes this was wrong of me but I wouldn't have found some truths without it), a lot of trickle truthing and some gaslighting of her, this is what I learned:\n\n- She hooked up with a FWB on the first week of Sept. 2023, let's call him A. I don't mind about this because I also hooked up with someone else on the same day (coincidence) and we had no concept or expectation of exclusivity at that point.\n\n- During our relationship she tried a couple of times for me to meet A, who lives in my former town, hiding the fact they used to be FWB. When I asked her about it she first stated they were just friends, then later \"they just kissed a few times\", and only after a few arguments she admitted they had hooked up several times in the past up until Sept. 9th 2023. They know each other since they are kids.\n\n- She always deleted messages from A and admits to doing it because he was always hitting on her. She ended up deleting Instagram after all of this. To me it feels like she was keeping him as a rebound.\n\n- She was sure I was hooking up during my trip with my female friend, and only later into our engagement she found out she was wrong. I know this because one day she complained about me seeing my female friend and we had an argument where I explained to her she is strictly my friend and has been for several years.\n\n- Since to her I was hooking up with my friend, she hooked up with another long time (about one year) FWB on the party of Sept. 30th. Let's call him B. They went back to her place and spent the night there. She texted me good morning that day while he was still with her. Around 11am she asked him to leave and lied to him she was going to have lunch with her family so she could be alone. She tells me she deeply regrets hooking up with him that day. Before and after (next day) her going to the party we were talking about how much we missed each other. She omitted and lied about this several times before admitting it.\n\n- On Oct. 10th, when we officially started dating, she and B were texting about her going to his place to hook up, but she didn't and ended up spending the day with me instead. She claims she never hooked up with him again after the party and just talked about it. I believe her because I read her texts with her friends over these events. Again, I know it was wrong of me to snoop but I wouldn't be sure otherwise.\n\n- She and B didn't use protection when they hooked up. She always knew I was very concerned about protection because I myself was extremely promiscuous. We only stopped using protection after I did my yearly STD exams on Dec. 2023 and verified I was all clear. I kept using protection with her for 3-4 months (Sept-Dec) because it's the adult thing to do and out of concern for her. Again, I was very promiscuous when single and sometimes it happened I engaged in unsafe sex acts. After she told me the truth about this she also did her exams and is also all clear.\n\nCurrently:\n\nWe've been having arguments about this for 50 days now.\n\nI'm feeling betrayed because I felt like we had an exclusivity clause at that point early in our relationship, even though I understand it wasn't clearly defined and communicated. I also hate the fact she was discussing with her FWB about hooking up on the very same day we ended up formalizing our dating.\n\nShe feels like it wasn't wrong or cheating because to her we were just hooking up and it was very early in the beginning of our relationship. She claims I'm making a bigger deal of it than I should.\n\nThere was a lot of trickle truthing and gaslighting until she came clean about the whole thing. In the beginning she used to tell me I was paranoid about it, that she didn't hook up with anyone in September other than me, and got her friends to reinforce this lie. She lied and omitted a lot at the beginning of our arguments over all of this. This has severely damaged my trust in her. I also feel like there might be something she's still not telling me because she basically only confirmed the things I found out about. Also, most of this happened about two years ago so I understand it might be hard for her to remember somethings.\n\nI was extremely angry at her trying to get me to friend A while hiding the fact they used to be FWB. This feels morally wrong for me. As if it's an excuse and justification for them to keep close ties even though she asked me to go no contact with everyone I used to hook up or date.\n\nWhen researching up on all of this I get the feeling we're in an anxious-avoidant trap. I'm usually a secure attachment type of person. I used to have 100% trust in her, never snooped on her phone or anything like that. Since all this started I'm feeling very anxious and she tries her best to avoid talking about all of this. She claims she doesn't like to talk about her past and that we should just move on from this, thinking about our present and our future.\n\nGoing devil's advocate, when we started hooking up she was still in the \"mourning\" phase of a past relationship where the guy cheated on her with a close friend. She has mentioned this several times, to me and her friends, that she was emotionally blocked at the time and didn't see herself in a relationship just yet.\n\nTo be clear: I would NOT have a problem with all of this had she just straight up told me the truth in the beginning. I understand the beginning of relationships between friends can get messy sometimes. I just wish she was honest with me from the beginning as I was with her. I never hid from her the fact I hooked up with other people before Sept. 14th.\n\nHer sister told me I should just \"get revenge\" and hook up with someone else but to me this just feels wrong. I don't want to do that and it wouldn't fix anything at all. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind or something.\n\n*Before we started having these arguments our relationship was pretty much perfect.* I'm deeply in love with this woman. I want to marry her and have children with her. However, these events have deeply shaken my trust in her. It feels like I'm mourning the death of the perfect persona I admired of her and I'm left accepting her as I know her now, someone capable of sleeping with other people while being with me and lying.\n\nI'm feeling very anxious about these issues and I don't know how to best handle it. Every time I talk to her about it, it turns into a huge argument. How can we fix this situation as a couple?\n\nNOTE: English is not my first language, it's Brazilian Portuguese. To us \"hook up\" means \"ficar\" and \"to date\" means \"namorar\", they are similar but different concepts.\n\nTL;DR: Two years into our relationship I find out my fiancee hooked up with a FWB when we were around date n. 6 when I was travelling with a female friend. At the time she claimed she didn't want to just hookup so a relationship was implied. She feels like it wasn't cheating but to me it does.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Recently I started feeling emotionally distant due to the lack of quality time I think we spend together. We both have full time jobs, and he has an additional part time job that he works for fun that takes up a decent amount of him time on the weekends (ideally I wish he’d stop working this job because I can see that it’s burning him out but that’s a whole other issue).\n\nMost of the time we spend together is co-existing in our apartment either doing separate activities, for example I’m reading while he’s gaming, or we are watching tv together. While I do value this time together and the fact that we can coexist, I really want more intentional quality time together. So I brought this up to him, unfortunately throughout several conversations spanning several days while I tried to collect my thoughts and pinpoint my exact feelings.\n\nAt the end of one of our conversations we determined that we have different perspectives of what quality time is for the each of us, mine being more intentional, and mentally present, without tv or phones, while coexisting is enough quality time for him. At the end of our last conversation, I told him that I am going to make more of an effort to create intentional time together since I know that will help me to feel more satisfied in our relationship, but I had asked him to make more of an effort to do this as well.\n\nSince then, I have made more of an effort, such as suggesting we eat dinner at the table instead of watching tv, or suggesting small activities like cooking, to do together. Since our convo I don’t think he has initiated any time like this, and during some casual activities would be on his phone.\n\nI’m getting frustrated and disappointed with his actions, but is there anything else I can do? I feel like I’ve communicated my feelings but I don’t want our relationship to end over this.

For purposes of this Reddit post I’ll call him Josh. His long term best friend, I’ll call him Ryan, we have both know for many years. Josh has known him for almost ten and I have known him for 7. We were actually introduced to each other through Ryan. At the time we were introduced, Ryan and I were deep in a situationship. We have always had an on again, off again connection since we have met.\n\nAround 2 month after I met Josh, Ryan got back with his ex girlfriend and things between us were ended immediately. To stress, I was 19 years old at the time, and as an attempt to hurt Ryan, I started seeing Josh. I actually fell completely in love with Josh, we are literally a match made in heaven, we complete and compliment each other so perfectly. I do still love Josh.\n\nWe both cut contact with Ryan almost two years ago as a lot of stuff about our relationship got out that he had previously kept from his girlfriend and she felt it was best none of us had any contact anymore, and so we haven’t.\n\nWe share a mutual circle of friends, and while Josh and Ryan are still friends they are no where near as close as they were. Ryan had tried everything in his power to convince me not to be with Josh at the beginning and this really took a toll on their friendship.\n\nSince we share a group of friends, we find ourselves running into eachother at bars and clubs. Anytime I see Ryan, we don’t even have to speak, it will send me into a spiral. These spirals can last weeks. I will do nothing but sit with regret, and think of him constantly.\n\nI have recently found myself having really intense feelings surround Ryan. I miss him incredibly, he was my best friend at a point and I have not found such a strong connection with anyone else. Friend or relationship.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point now that I struggle to be around Josh. I am snappy, mean spirited and outright horrible to him when we are together. I find myself aggravated by his presence and just want to be by myself. Anytime I am with him I am constantly thinking about Ryan.\n\nBut, since we have a child together, and I do still have feelings of love for Josh, do I just stay with him? I know that I will never feel the way I do for Ryan with anyone else, so do I just settle for what’s comfortable? Especially since we have a baby. I know that there is no chance for Ryan and I, he is still with his girlfriend and we haven’t had a conversation since we stopped contact.

Need advice.\n\nHey everyone. So I (20M) met this girl (let’s call her Ara, 19F) while studying abroad in Spain. We clicked really fast, spent about a month together in person (end of May to end of June), and since coming back we’ve been talking for around 3 months straight. At first it was just as friends, but the vibe has definitely shifted into more-than-friends. We FaceTime almost every day, text constantly, and there’s been flirting, compliments, playfighting, her calling me pretty/handsome, and both of us admitting to jealousy stuff I would never normally do with just friends.\n\nHere’s where it gets complicated:\n- Her ex. She broke up with her boyfriend about a month ago (August). She says she doesn’t have feelings for him anymore, but she felt responsible for him because he leaned on her emotionally (he even said his life would fall apart without her). That made me uncomfortable, because it felt like emotional attachment, even if not romantic. Just recently (literally yesterday), she blocked him and cut off all contact because it was too much. She’s also told me she had been mentally checked out of the relationship for a while.\n- My own baggage. I also just got out of a situationship that messed me up. I’ve been processing it for months, and even though I don’t have romantic feelings for that girl anymore, I still sometimes grieve it when I see her around campus. So part of me wonders if I rushed into catching feelings for Ara because of how nice the attention felt.\n- We admitted feelings. We’ve straight up told each other that we like each other. We agreed we can’t keep acting like a couple because it doesn’t feel right right now, but we keep folding and crossing the boundaries we set.\n- The jealousy piece. I get jealous when she talks about other guys, and she gets jealous when I talk to other girls. We both admit it doesn’t feel right to be this jealous “as just friends,” but the feelings are real and hard to control.\n- The distance. We’re planning to see each other in December — that’s realistically the next time we could meet in person. Until then, it’s all long-distance, and honestly that scares me. I’ve seen people clown on long-distance and say it never works. I don’t want this to be just “in love with my phone.”\n\nSo now I feel torn.\n\nOn one hand, I really care about her and genuinely like her. On the other, the timing feels awful: neither of us has fully healed or had enough time to process from our past situations, and we live far apart. We both said we don’t want to hurt each other and that we want to keep the friendship no matter what, but at this point we’re way past normal friendship territory. I think part of this is us filling each other’s voids, but another part feels like genuine interest that just grew through the screen. \n\nWhat I’m struggling with:\n\n- How do I know if we like each other or if we’re just attached to the attention?\n- Should we keep texting/calling and try to maintain this spark until December, or is that just setting us up to get hurt?\n- Are we just filling voids while we’re both vulnerable?\n- Is it worth even trying long distance when people say it rarely works?\n\nI want to respect her, keep the friendship, and not lose her. But I also don’t want to get stuck in something unhealthy where we’re both confused and end up hurt.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I’m breaking down just thinking about this.\n\nI (M, early 20s) am in love with the most amazing girl (F, early 20s). We’ve been together for over a year, even though it’s long-distance. We’ve broken up twice before because we thought we couldn’t handle the distance, but every time we come back to each other — because the love is real.\n\nThe problem is her family. They don’t allow her to date at all. If they found out about me, she could lose her phone, her freedom, everything. So she can’t tell them about me, while my whole family knows and supports us.\n\nOur only way of being together is through late-night calls. Every night we fall asleep on the phone together. It’s what keeps me going. But she’s about to move into a new house and share a room with her sister, who doesn’t know about me. That means no more calls. Just texting. And deep down we both know we probably can’t survive like that.\n\nLast night she told me she feels like she’s holding me back, that I sacrifice too much for us.

I met this girl my age online and over time we became best friends. Even exchanged each others numbers, called, she introduced me to her mother etc. We were just really close, and she had no other friends since she couldnt attend school for a while because of her mental issues, which I wont go into, but I feel as if its import to mention.\n\nWe talked mainly over the summer, like everyday, i had a summertime job, and my day was basically: work and talk to her. And well she didnt do any work so she also chatted me any chance she could get. We talked about everything there was to talk about, we shared some really fucked up secrets about each other, and well we werent afraid to do it, because we trusted each other that much, we could just tell each other anything and we knew that we wont judge each other, or tell anyone else. I had friends IRL too, from my class, but i just prefered talking to her, it felt so much more sincere, so much deeper. I liked her a whole lot, and she was attached to me aswell.\n\nAs time went on, i began to grow feelings for her, i began crushing at her. We began giving a little \"too much\" care to each other. Something \"friends\" dont really do. It felt like a relationship, even tho it wasnt, we percieved each other as the closest of friends. But it felt like something more, the time we invested into each other, the care, the assurance, the \"love\".\n\nThen it hit me. I couldnt do this. I knew that if we went on, we would begin do develop bigger feelings for each other, and eventually it would grow into a long distance relationship. I knew that we arent ready for that, we are still very young, and well, im more of a physical person, i crave contact and touch and well just seeing the person in person. So i knew it wouldnt work. She moves alot because of her mothers job, she even lived in my country for a while, when she was little tho. So i started being desperate, i thought maybe she can move here again, maybe her mother can get a position here again. But no, she could only get a position elsewhere, my country was not on the list. So i knew we couldnt be with each other. There was no way. \n\nI was now stuck beetwen a rock and a hard place, i knew that if we continued talking it would hurt us both because it would be wrong to do a long distance relationship given our age and circumstances, but also I couldnt just stay friends because weve already come so far. I couldnt be friends with someone that i dont see as a friend, but as a crush.\n\nSo i decided to leave her. I left her all alone and she was in a lot of pain. She tried to convince me so much to keep talking to her. I didnt want to do it and i cried alot aswell. But I told her that despite it all we cant continue talking. It felt right but it felt wrong. No, honestly, everything felt wrong at the moment.\n\nFast forward a couple of months. I still think about her daily. And each day i grow a bigger urge to text her again. But i feel like i dont have the right to. I hurt a person who was already struggling with trauma and issues. I played with her feelings in a way. And i just think if i go back i will reopen wounds and potentially hurt her again. But i dont know, honestly at this moment she is all i want. I just want to speak to her again. Theres really no one like her. Ive dated girls in real life and all of that, its all so bland and just insufferable. If you knew her you would know how special she is.

I wanna start doing calls but im not confident with my English and feels like it would be really awkward.\n\nAlso, she's kind of an avoidant type so if i \"cling\" too much she'll just start pulling away or atleast that's how i think.

I think it’s partly my fault, because if she wasn’t available for a while to talk she would apologise, which I thought wasn’t necessary as we weren’t officially anything yet, so when I would do the same I wouldn’t really apologise or acknowledge. \n\nAbout a couple weeks ago I didn’t respond to her one evening, because I thought some space would be healthy as we had spent so much constant time together, and because I didn’t want us to burn out before meeting as she lives abroad but is coming to my home country for 3 months to stay with a friend for a while. Maybe she took this the wrong way and I made her feel unwanted? This was the first time I had shifted the pace since things escalated. I didn’t communicate that I felt like I wanted some space because I couldn’t figure out how to do that without it sounding bad. \n\nShe would always apologise saying why she wasn’t responding, and she mentioned she had some drama with another friend recently which I think took up a lot of her attention, I thought fair enough. \n\nSince then she’s slowly stopped messaging as much throughout the day, I thought it was just maybe she felt the same and that some space was healthy for the both of us, I didn’t think much of it. But this week she hadn’t messaged me at all for 5 days. I messaged her after 3 days saying that I was thinking about her and that I hope she was having a better week than the last, and then she took another 2 days to respond to that, and she said I’m so sorry these past few days I’ve been so busy, and “awww you think about me?”\n\nThis space has made me realize how much I value this connection and I don’t want to lose her, because of how things started out organically in a gaming community there was no expectations, we just started out as friends but with the amount of flirting etc it was clear we both wanted something more than friends but I hadn’t really thought about what that was. Until now, I was against LDR but with her we get on like a house on fire and she makes me want to try. \n\nI want to have a conversation about where we stand because I feel like I am sat in this emotional limbo right now and I need clarity, but with her responses she is controlling the tempo at the moment and I don’t want to come across as needy or desperate lunging out with paragraphs.I feel like maybe she just wanted my attention and now she’s bored? Or maybe I haven’t been fully committed like she has and that’s not what she’s looking for? But this is a two way street, if she had any issues with the space etc she could say that right? I know it’s a man’s job traditionally to lead but these sorts of conversations are a two way street. \n\nAs fun as it’s been with her maybe she’s waiting for me to be more direct about where we stand because she doesn’t want to waste time if it’s not going anywhere serious?\n\nI just need some advice on what to do from here because I care about her a lot and I don’t know what to do.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

In the beginning, everything feels exciting but at the back of your mind there’s that constant worry what if this doesn’t go anywhere? What if I’m just setting myself up for disappointment? It’s tough because relationships do take time to grow, and you can’t know everything about someone right away but at the same time no one wants to feel like they’re wasting months or even years on the wrong person. I think part of the struggle is figuring out when to give things a fair chance versus when to trust your gut that something isn’t working, it’s not always clear, and sometimes you only realize it in hindsight. The fear of wasting time can make it hard to relax and enjoy the process of getting to know someone because you’re always calculating the what ifs. How do you personally deal with that fear?

I  REALLY need advice.\n\nWe've been together for almost 4 years now. At the beginning, I was dating him because he was a good boy. By this I mean, he would not be like other fuckboys. He wanted a relationship and not just sex. He was not into the partying, drinking, football, violent sports, etc. He's a feminist. He's a vegetarian like me. And our ethics and morals and thoughts about minorities align with each other. I thought that I made a very good choice of a partner. He used to treat me nicely and would be attentive and I used to compliment him on this. In household there is constant screaming. We don't have current water nor much electricity. So I pretty much live with him and his family now. (Been doing it for almost a year and I feel guilty). We have been arguing almost every day more and more. And I'm just not happy with the life I have. He still doesn't have his driver's license. I beg for him to work out. And he doesn't. He’s lazy and not productive and smokes too much weed.\n\nYesterday we argued a lot. I said he was rude to me all day. He said it was vc I was rude first. Which in some cases I was. We were playing a boardgame with his sibilings. His sister was talking to me about smt we both like so I didn’t realise his brother was explaining his move. I kept talking to her and then my bf told me to stfu. What made me go crazy was that when I tried to explain my feelings then he started saying that I overreacted. The argument went back and forth in a circle. And I ended up being very self-destructive. Saying horrible things. And he told me that I was performative. I literally wanted to harn myself in the morning.\n\nOne of the things I brought up:  Yesterday we went to the beach with his brother and he didn’t swim nor play ball with us. He laid on our towels (he didn’t bring one) and read his book the entire time. He didn’t walk with us bc he wanted to get hug first. I bring this up to him as one of the things that bothered me bc I feel he prioritises other stuff when I wanted to go to the beach with him and I felt like he wasn’t there. As often he told me he was there and that I got mad “because I read a book?”. Like why is he missing the point? This kind of responses and him saying I’m overreacting when I was trying to communicate made me feel so powerless that I started hurting my head. He then said I was performative. I don’t think he likes me sometimes.\n\nHe's working towards his goals. But I feel like the process is going very slowly. And it tells him to learn how to trade. Because he knows someone that also does it and he has financial independence. And I just feel like he's not really going places as I want to. Because of my situation, I have to make a lot of money very quickly so I can escape my situation and I can get my own place. And for me that's a priority. And he's still finishing his university degree. He's making very little money. I feel like our situation is not getting better anytime soon. And I cannot stand it. Because I know that there are some men there that put in the work and are productive and driven and successful. And that work day and night to achieve what they have to. Because of my line of work, I feel like many men would not like to date me (I’m a cam girl). So idk if I’m being unrealistic and if I would ever get a man like me (fit, productive, caring) to marry me. I'm going to start making a lot of money soon. And that's all I need to focus on because of my situation. I feel financially dependent on him because I can only record and stream on his room. I feel like I have no place to go. And I just feel very unhappy all the time.\n\nI don't know what to do with my life. I feel very lost. I feel like I've lost so many years if I break up now. I feel like no high value man is going to want me. And I really don't want to go back to my house. I only have 4k saved up. I feel like getting old and miserable so be every day is harder. I'm going to have to spend it all if I move out. And things might not work out. And I'm so scared. And I want to give up. Because my life has been always so hard. And I'm so tired of fighting. I feel so alone. Like he won't make the change in the progress that I need. And I'm so lost. I need advice on what to do. Options I have thought about: be in this situation til I make enough (idk if I can keep going),  try couples conseuling, leave and go somewhere and spend all my money and try to make it back.

We went through a couple of breakups and eventually decided we aren’t compatible in a traditional relationship. The “relationship” title and the idea of a lifelong commitment added too much pressure for both of us. That said, we still care deeply for each other and continue to do BDSM together (she’s a sub). We are also planning to live together for a year or two, just to experience living together / 24-7 DS dynamic. \n\nDuring one of our breakups, she discovered Shibari and started playing with several local riggers. I’m learning too, but my skills are nowhere near what more experienced riggers can offer. We’ve talked about her seeing other riggers, and I agreed. Logically, I want to be supportive of her exploring and enjoying what she loves.\n\nBut emotionally, it’s harder. I see Shibari as a very intimate experience. Attending classes and performances together has always reinforced that belief for me. Like it really pains me to imagine her being tied up the same way the rope bottom did in the performance / classes. I define intimacy through vulnerability, not just sex. For her, intimacy is tied more directly to sex — so for her, Shibari is non-sexual and just about letting the rigger provide a unique physical experience. For me, though, it still feels very intimate.\n\nThe conflict is: how do I deal with this difference? Logically, I want to be supportive, but sometimes it is very difficult to be in the right headspace to be supportive. It gets especially complicated because she wants to spend the night with me afterward, when she’s experiencing sub-drop (she says she always feels a strong drop after Shibari). On the one hand, it feels good that she turns to me for comfort and wants to be with me at the end of the day.

Within the last three years I have probably been around his daughter (14) a total of 4-5 times. Awkward.. I know. I’ve battled with this but when I say he worships her, I mean that. So, it’s hard to bring up how he acts to him when it comes to her. For my birthday he made all of these plans for me and then that Thursday, the day before we were supposed to leave for a weekend, he canceled because she decided to come down. I was upset and expressed this to him and his excuse is always “she’ll be 18 soon and I won’t get to spend time with her anymore.” Need I remind you that every time my bday month comes around, she comes down every weekend that month and then the next.. she disappears. Not only that, I’ve always taken the backseat for her. She plays sports and I’m not allowed to go to any games. She told him she didn’t like me because I didn’t get her a bday gift (our 2nd year together). Mind you.. I hardly know her because at this point I had only been around her maybe three times for less than an hour.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I asked him to attend my kids (11M and 8M) football games. It’s always something to where he can’t attend. My boys also don’t have a father. When I left him he ditched his kids and my BF knows that and he knows how important it is for me and them, for him to show up. Well of course, he plans to come and then says he can’t because his daughter is coming down. By this point I’m fuming but I still remained calm when asking him why he’s doing this. He then blames me and says that I never understand the time he needs to spend with his daughter. When my only time bringing that up was my bday and this specific event with him attending my kids games. I’m just over it.\n\nI also realized how detailed he is with her. For her bday he talked about what he was getting her every day up until he got it. Which there’s nothing wrong with that. It just shows that he’s capable of gift giving and making plans but he doesn’t do that for me.. at all! Out of the three years we’ve been together I’ve only gotten a gift for one bday and it was a pair of converse. He never remembers what I ask for, never plans dates and actually follows through but the moment she mentions a gift she wants or somewhere she wants to go, he will literally talk about it for daaaays AND follow through.\n\nIt’s his child so I get it, I love that he loves her but sometimes I feel he’s not capable of loving anyone else.

We live about three hours apart. We clicked fast on voice notes—deep chats, values, family stories. He was driving past my city on the way to see his family, so we met for a first date: a walk in a beautiful park with his dog. Easy conversation. We scheduled a second date for about two and a half weeks later when he’d be passing through again.\n\nBetween dates we talked every day by audio, even while he was in Italy with family and friends for wedding plans. He sent photos with his family, I shared my world too. It felt like a real connection forming.\n\nA week before date two he said a friend from abroad was visiting and he wouldn’t be able to reply much. I appreciated the transparency and let it be. After the visit he said the weekend was intense and he’d rather answer the audios in person.\n\nDate two came. He arrived about thirty minutes late after a long drive. We had breakfast, the banter was good, nothing physical happened which I was fine with—it’s still early. He was heading on to a mountain trip with colleagues. I didn’t follow up after, but he texted that night to thank me, apologized for being late, and said he’d reach out the next day.\n\nThe next night he sent a long message saying that with the distance and seeing each other so infrequently it’s hard for him to build the connection he wants, and it would only get harder once he was back in to a even further a way place where he is doing his PhD (making distance from 3 hours to 4). He said he preferred to stop here, that he enjoyed meeting me, and wished me well.\n\nI replied politely. Later I asked for feedback…was it mainly distance or just not feeling it. He sent an audio saying the connection was there but he didn’t feel the spark, and he couldn’t tell if that was because of distance or if it would be the same even in the same city. He offered friendship and said if I’m ever in his city he’d show me around. I declined the friendship lane.\n\nMy read: the turn started during that four-day gap with his friends. He mentioned more people joined, including girls. After that his energy cooled, the voice notes stopped, he was late to the date, and then he closed it. It feels like proximity won: either he met or re-sparked something local, or the gap simply exposed that his pull for me wasn’t strong enough to pay the distance tax. I don’t think I imagined the connection—he shared a lot—but connection and spark are different, and distance magnifies that difference.\n\nI’m calm and slow-to-warm, so I’m trying to keep things romantic rather than pen-pal next time. If you’ve been in a similar spot, how did you keep momentum when you live a few hours apart?\n\nPs: he was in a previous relationship where the distance was 7 hours, and the miles were usually mostly done by him.\n\n\nTL;DR: strong connection over daily voice notes, two dates, then he ended it with “connection yes, no spark—distance makes it hard.” I think proximity and low tolerance for distance decided it.

Which I thought was weird. He was just like if we feel eachother we shouldnt stop the feelings that we are having. Anyway, we planned our first date a week and a half out due to our schedules. \n\nOn the date, he kissed me about an hour into the date, held my hand and rubbed his hand on my legs. After were were at the bar for a few hours, he was like lets go on a walk. We went on a walk and sat on a bench and made out. I told him to come over and have sex with me because honestly i havent had sex in a long time.\n\nThe sex was great, he stayed the night and we did it multiple times. I made him breakfast before he left and we planned our second date. We went out to eat on our second date we had sex. He told me a few things on this date: I mentioned how i was you ger than him and he told me he normally dates girls 19-23.. Then he told me he lived with his parents.. he told me how much he makes at his current job which I make double that. While I own a home as well. I planned the third date which wad him coming over and I made him a dinner.\n\nHe loved the meal I made him. I dont feel like he was in the mood for sex and I may have just been in the mood to do it so bad. So we did and he stayed over. He just kept saying how tired he was and everything so I dont know if he felt like we had to have sex. But he did have sex with me when we woke up the next morning. I made him breakfast and snuck a i made brownie into the lunch he brought over for work the text day and wrote have a good day at work.\n\nDuring the entire encounter between us we hung out within an entire week. He told me he follows these corey wayne teachings so we wouldn’t communicate a lot due to the corey wayne teachings.\n\nWhen I texted him about hanging out again. He didnt want to move forward. He said I was great and our chemistry was great but something felt off and ye didn’t want to move forward\n\nI know I only spent a few weeks knowing him, but I felt so happy being around him and spending time with him. It killed my confidence as well. I just got not a lot of mixed signals and he always talked futuristic about everything. I feel like i miss the connection and cant stop thinking about it .

Every relationship I’ve had so far was with men at least 10 years older.\n\nIn my last relationship (I was 24, he was 34) my ex kept trying to “teach” me things for four years straight. The age gap became really obvious in our different life goals. He wanted to move to the countryside, buy a house, have kids. I didn’t want to leave the city and I’m just not ready for children yet.\n\nFor the past two years I tried dating guys my own age, give or take a few years, and it just doesn’t work.

And of course my body reacts instantly.\n\nI do see a lot of issues with a big age gap though. Different stages in life for one. I’d still be working when a man who is 10+ years older would already be retired. I wouldn’t have the free time to actually spend with him. Some of them are already done with family planning. I still enjoy going out in the evenings and I think weekends should be full of experiences, not just TV and coffee. That’s just my experience the past few years.\n\nDo I just have to accept this? Is there really no way to change what you’re attracted to? Where does this even come from? Have other women maybe noticed that once they hit their 30s or 40s they started being more into guys their own age? Or is it more about mentality and life experience?\n\nMy family also puts a lot of pressure on me asking why I always bring home, in my dad’s words, “old geezers.” Even though I know it’s my choice I’d still like my partner to be welcomed warmly and not met with comments like “when you were born he was already 10, 15, 20.”", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

He was super handsome, super funny and I thought super genuine. He would pay for dates and was super kind. We were seeing each other for a little over 2 months. He told me he was looking for a serious relationship, I said I was too. However, we never had the “what are we talk”. I liked the pace we were going. Seeing each other once or twice a week. Calling and Texting. I thought it really had potential. Honestly, I had not felt like this about a guy in a LONG time. \n\nOne night, we had a really good date. He kissed me goodbye. He said he would be busy the next day because he was hanging out with some friends. He texted me he got home safe. The next morning, I texted him good morning and to have fun with his friends. I never got a response. Completely ghosted. I never texted twice because after a day, I knew it wasn’t an accident. He didn’t think to text me all day. I was crushed truly. Heartbroken. It seemed like everything was going good then boom, it all went down the drain. I was very upset for about a week and then slowly got over it. This happened about 2 months ago now. \n\nFast forward to a week ago. I’m happy and putting myself out there. I’m at a bar and I see him. He is with a girl. I walk up to the bar. I’m ordering a drink and I hear his voice. He is close enough I can hear him but I don’t think he noticed me. I heard him tell some guy he knew that the girl was his girlfriend. It was like the healed wound ripped open. I left the bar immediately before he could see me. I tried not to let it bother me. \n\n2 days ago, my friend texted me that her friend is best friends with this guys girlfriend (if that makes since). They all went out for drinks I guess. She found out that this girl and my ex met the day after our last date. The day he ghosted me. When he was supposed to be with his friends. I guess they met, haven’t stopped talking since and have officially been dating for a month. Which means it took him a month to ask her to be his girlfriend.

I just can’t help looking at her photos and wondering what she has that made him forget about me so fast. My friend told me she said they day they met, it was unexpected. They were both at this hangout I guess and they spent the whole day and night together. We never once had a sleepover. I was not able to sleep waiting for a text back while he was sleeping soundly with this girl. How he could he go from me to her so fast? What about her made him completely forget about me?

Occasionally, we start messaging again before it dries up again.\n\nI moved to Madrid two years ago, while she lived in Barcelona. As we didn´t talk much, I forgot to tell her whenever I went to Barcelona (twice) and so we never met in person. I have sinced moved back to the UK.\n\nFor the past month or even two months, we have been talking nearly every day. Our chats have become a lot more personal and sometimes even sexual (talking about fetishes, likes and dislikes, sex lives etc) \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was still living in the UK and she was visiting London for a concert. She invited me to come with her since she was alone and wanted to meet me. I was bored since I was waiting for my visa to return to Spain and was frustrated since I waited 8 weeks for it at the time  (it coincidentally arrived as soon as I came back from London.)\n\nShe had her own flat and only one bed, obviously we would be sleeping together. I have done this with both make and female friends before, she said that no sex was going to happen so I assumed it wouldn't go there.\n\nWhile in London, things were friendly. It was nice to be with her although I was extremely nervous. She kept holding my arms, hands and laid on me every time we sat down at a bench. We went to the park and she grabbed my hand and put it down her top to touch her breasts. I was surprised and couldn't quite believe it at first, but it was funny as she was laughing and I was embarrassed.\n\nWe had food and returned to her apartment. We sat and watched a movie before she suddenly turned the lights off and took her clothes off, we then had sex. I didn't quite prepare for any of this to happen. It sort of just happened without me even thinking or wanting it on text to being in this situation.\n\n\nI returned to Spain two weeks ago and we have spoken every day. I told her that I like talking to her and enjoyed London, but as I have no idea how long I'll be in Spain for and that I'm not ready for a relationship (especially one that is long distance). She took it badly at first and was upset. \n\nWe continued talking and she kept asking to come to Madrid where I live. I felt pressured to say yes, because she kept asking if I was interested in her and she wants to see me a lot. She booked tickets to visit and now will be staying with me. While I enjoy her company, I don't really want sex. Yes, it is fun and nice to be intimate and to spend time together, but without a clear thought on what exactly our relationship is and how it became how it is, I feel empty.\n\nShe keeps getting mad at me when I dont talk much or when I don't ask her things that she hasn't requested. She wants to get to know me more and seems controlling and clingy. Every time I stop talking as much, she blows up my phone and gets sad. \n\nI didn't think we had much chemistry and ever since London, she won't leave me alone. I got scared before my flight (4 days after London) since it felt like she was a girlfriend - constantly checking how I was, where I was and how my flight was. \n\nI want to be with her and still talk, but I'm unsure how to feel.

Throwaway account because my friends use reddit and i need a username that doesn’t trace back to me lol. Sorry for the long post ahead!\n\nI met my BF when I was 17 and he was 18. It was right out of the pandemic and I was also coming from a bad break up that I reunited with my highschool classmate during one of my closest friend’s bday party, lets call him Ray. \n\nRay transferred to another school before I could actually meet him so our interaction was very chill and surprised that we knew each other despite not being in the same circles. After catching up for like a week, he introduced me to his friends from his different school, thats where I met my BF, lets call him Eric. \n\nMy first interaction with Eric was actually just in a voice call lol and we bonded over playing video games (it wasnt just us but Ray and his other friends were there). While in a game, I would talk flirtatiously to Eric because I was bored and single so why not…It was i guess 2 weeks of accompanying each other that we were all in a vouce chat, chilling, playing games, watching a movie, etc. This was around June 2022. \n\nThe next month, July, I had my 18th bday celebration but alot of my invited guests canceled and couldnt come, so I just invited Eric and 2 more ppl. While at the party, I kept being touchy with Eric and just being playful in general. After that day, thats when we started to really talk and flirt one another. I wont write abt how we started exclusively dating, we just went out on a lot of dates for 1 month and he asked me to be his gf, yada yada..\n\nFast forward to 7 months of being official, the same friend that had a bday party where I met Ray, lets call her Kate! She invited Eric and I to a sleepover party…And this is where everything went down hill…We were all tipsy and in the dining room table it was Me, Eric, Kate, and another friend Joe. \n\nThe conversation was something like truth or dare and when it was my turn I chose, truth. Kate then proceeded to ask “do i still think abt my exes?” (nonverbatim because i dont remember the exact question, it was 3yrs ago!) I stupidly said yes and a name. Eric was beside shocked and quiet then he went out to the garage and started punching the wall…He was with 2 other guys as soon as he went out so thankfully it was stopped immediately…\n\nMeanwhile, Me, Kate, and Joe discussed what I did wrong, that I didnt have to answer it. I completely acknowledged my fault and after a few hours of calming down, Eric and I talked outside…We were able to resolve the problem, discussing boundaries and where I went wrong.\n\nAfter this event, Ive realized how Eric frequently had panic attacks and depressive episodes when I was not ok or in general, in our relationship. For example, I am the type of person who keeps myself busy when I feel sad. So, if we fight I usually log off the internet and do some homework. I have already told Eric this attitude of mine as soon as I started dating him. \n\nAnother terrible instance we had, was around our 1yr anniversary. We took a whole week break from one another because it was becoming overbearing to carry his issues plus mine… there was a mention of his ex at that time…and we realized that we were not each others ideal type—it really hard to accept that. We knew we were not mentally stable but couldnt afford therapy to help us (keep in mind that throughout our relationship we are college students) \n\nDuring this break, we still said our good morning and asked what we were doing. He was unable to eat because of the anxiety and depression he was feeling. While I tried to unpack my feelings for him with a friend. This friend told me to break up with him because it felt like Eric was “manipulating” me emotionally. After that week, we tried to get things back to normal. \n\nBut there were a lot of instances that I would open up to my friends abt our relationship problems or even blurting out that “I was tired (of our rs)” while I was drunk. All my friends advised me to just break up with him. I stayed because I thought that in the future these problems would be fixed or maybe I also did not have the gut to break up with him and be alone again…asshole i know\n\nFast forward again to our 2nd year. This was the closest we had to breaking up hahah…I am an extroverted person and when I try to become friends with others, Eric always has a stern look and tells me to tone it down a bit. This was due to me having an incident of cheating, it was only one time and it wasn’t during my relationship with Eric but with another ex which was in 2020. \n\nInitially, I felt very limited with Eric thats why I told him we need to take a break again. It was 2 weeks of minimal communication. Another friend told me that if I was staying just because of the friends I made in Eric’s group then it isnt worth staying. \n\nAdmittedly, I did say that, my life has been completely intertwined with Eric’s, my friends were his friends and it felt like the most safe space I have ever had, even better than the friends I made from uni. \n\nYet, again when I was ready to tell Eric to break up I just bursted out crying and could not go through with it. \n\nNow, I am currently having doubts about our relationship. I feel very disconnected from Eric, he isnt that clingy as he gives me my space and we dont usually go out anymore as with financial instability. These doubts come in waves sometimes its for a couple of days then I dont remember it not until I feel distant from him again. I have to also confess that I tried to use anonymous chat sites just to feel thrill ??? \n\nTL;DR: I really dont know whether I should still stay because at this point our families know each other, he has even given me a puppy for my 21st (i love dogs but i didnt want it because I live in a small apartment with 2 of my family members), and our friends are the same. \n\nI know he doesnt deserve a partner who has half hearted feelings but whenever I tell him this he says its fine and we can work through it.

{"id": "u/Whereas master1430_1366", "user": "u/Whereas master1430", "text": "Has anyone actually made a relationship work with such a huge sex drive mismatch?\n\n\n\nI (22F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for about 1.5 years. In the beginning, our sex life was pretty good in that it was fairly frequent and mutual. But over time it’s dropped off drastically to the point where I feel like I’m almost celibate.\n\nFor months I was the only one initiating sex. Around 80% of the time I’d get rejected and he rarely initiated himself. It got to a point where we were having sex probably once every two weeks even though we live 5 minutes apart and spend the night together 3–4 times a week.\n\nI brought up how much this was bothering me and his response was that his sex drive is very low and it’s nothing to do with me. I asked him if there’s anything I can do to turn him on more or if there’s anything new we can try doing / basically make things more exciting and he said he didn’t think so. So it feels like there’s nothing I can even do. The “solution” we agreed on was for me to stop initiating and pull back sexually and he’ll initiate if he’s in the mood. Since then we’ve had sex once in a month. \n\nThe problem is my sex drive is really high. I want sex often and when I’m turned on around him I feel like I can’t do anything about it. When we do have sex most of the time it’s short and I rarely finish so I just feel so sexually frustrated.\n\ni don’t want to be insecure but It is having an affect on my confidence in the relationship. It just feels like he has no sexual attraction to me anymore. I’ve sent him nudes before and his response has been things like just “cute,” which makes me feel like he’s not even turned on by me. So I’ve just stopped sending him nudes too. because we did used to have a good sex life in the beginning I can’t stop wondering what’s changed. It makes me feel like it must be about me even though he insists it isn’t. He once told me that sex with his ex felt like a chore, and now he says his drive is the lowest it’s ever been. So I can’t help but worry that sex with me feels like a chore too. He also used to watch porn and says he doesn’t anymore, but I honestly don’t know if I believe him. It really hurts knowing he seemed to get turned on by porn (or at least used to) but not by me. \n\nWhen I try to talk about this he says that when I get upset over it it makes him want sex even less. The last time I brought it up he straight up said he was “bored” of the conversation and shut it down. this is l a pretty big issue for me and is causing a lot of sexual frustration and overthinking on my end, and it feels like he doesn’t even want to try to fix it or find a halfway happy. I’m left feeling like my needs don’t even matter which just adds to the frustration. If he’s not in the mood, we do nothing. He doesn’t help me finish anymore and there’s no alternative intimacy and I’m just left sexually frustrated.\n\nOutside of sex he’s really affectionate and loving and our relationship otherwise feels good. That’s what makes this so confusing. I love him so much and I know he loves me, but I feel like I’m sacrificing my entire sex life, and the last thing I want is to make him feel pressure.\nAny advice would be appreciated \n\nTL;DR: I feel sexually frustrated and unwanted because my boyfriend’s sex drive is extremely low and he won’t communicate about it.

{"id": "u/Icy-muoberry6162_1368", "user": "u/Icy-muoberry6162", "text": "I (29F) do not want kids, my boyfriend (29M) wants one\n\nFirst thing : my apologies for the possible mistakes in grammar and such, I'm French.\n\nWe've been together for 2 years now. We live separately but a few weeks ago my boyfriend asked me if I would agree to move with him once our professional situations would be stable enough. He's been in a medical limbo for almost three years now, which means he's never really taken the time to think about whether or not he wanted children. In fact, when we first met, he was completely resistant to the subject (which was fine with me, since on the very first date I told him I didn't want children and was considering having my tubes tied).\n\nHe has an older brother who has been a father for a year and a half, and a younger brother who just announced that he and his partner were expecting a child in may. From the moment they announced it, I knew they were going to come after me with \"what about the both of you?\", etc. \"They\" being my boyfriend's family because I do not have one anymore, I'm on my own. My boyfriend already feels quite isolated from the rest of his siblings because of his health problems, I knew it was only a matter of time before he felt isolated because he doesn't have any kid of his own. All the alarms went off in my head, when we discussed it he told me that I was making up scenarios in my head for nothing, that I was worrying too much... I reiterated that there was no way I was having a child, that it was something he would never have from me.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that he had changed his mind several months ago without telling me. He admitted to me two days later that he had known for 5 months that he wanted a child, that he wanted to leave \"a legacy\". We said goodbye on good terms, we still communicate by messages but I can't help but try to resolve this situation which, I know, is insoluble.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I'm mostly sad and bitter. These two years together were tumultuous to say the least, especially because of his health problems. We \"broke up\" once or twice, but I always hung on because a person's health is not a reason to break up for me. I made a lot of concessions and compromises to make it work; in retrospect, I was the one who kept our relationship going. Communication isn't his strong point, and he's what I call \"emotionally constipated.\" It was very difficult to get him to talk about his feelings, to open up to me. At the very beginning of our relationship, he even accused me of trying to \"change\" him just because I wanted him to talk to me. I'm aware of the efforts he made for me, but I remain bitter. Because a hypothetical child who may never exist automatically puts me out of the game when I gave absolutely everything I had for him, as if it didn't matter.\n\nI couldn't list all the reasons why I don't want children because there are so many, but despite that, I was ready to make one last concession: to promise to think about it again the day I have a stable professional, financial and material situation without any guarantee that the definitive answer would be positive. It's really the most I can do because there is no we're having a \"band-aid child\" who will not be wanted by one of his parents. I know it's a bad idea because he will wait on me all these years and I will never be serene because of that, but I can't help but try to find a solution, to not let the boat sink like that.\n\nThe worst part, and I may be cruel for thinking this and writing it here, is that I don't even think he'd make a good father. We both had violent childhoods, and right now I can't see him ending up any other way than like his father or mine. Wanting a child is easy, being ready to be a father is something else. He hates when something is unexpected and plans need to change and untimely noise, he describes his brothers as \"incarcerated\" in their relationships, and suddenly he wants to join them? I'd like to make him understand that there are other ways to \"leave a legacy,\" that we could both be absolutely happy, that we could babysit our nephews/nieces from time to time without having to change our lives irreversibly. On the other hand, he has every right to change his mind, and it would probably be rude of me to try to convince him to make this final concession for me, for all the ones I've made for him. If the roles were reversed, I don't know if I would accept it.\n\nShould I still try to talk him out of it ?\n\nTL;DR: I don't want children, he wants one, I'm trying not to lose my mind.\n\n  \nEDIT : Thanks everybody for your kind replies.\n\nI just want to clarify a point/add something that can explain why I'm so conflicted about this while the answer is kinda obvious.\n\nAs I said in the original post, I do not have a family of my own anymore. It's been 10 years (I'm gonna spare you the details but my grandfather couldn't keep his hands to himself and nobody did anything to stop him), so it sort of healed something in my when my boyfriend introduced me to his parents for the first time. 2 years ago was the first Christmas I didn't spend alone, crying in my apartment because I felt like a failure. Now I'm scared of the next one.\n\nI know having a kid to \"heal\" a part of yourself is one of the most selfish reasons to have children (and frankly I do not see any selfless reason to have a kid anyway) but sometimes I wonder if it could heal me in some way. I know that despite the fact that I want to be childfree I would be a great mom, but I know that it would also k\\*ll me. I long for a family. I finally had one again, now it's gone. I kinda feel betrayed (I shouldn't, I know it's because the wound is still fresh that I feel this way).\n\nMoreover, it made me consider the fact that my material situation is a big part of why I'm so adamant about not having kids : I'm unemployed because even selling your soul in this goddamn country cannot give you a job, I'm still living in the same studio I found when I was in college (so 1 living room with a kitchen in the corner, no separate bedroom). Will I change my mind once I live in a \\*real\\* apartment where I don't sleep where I cook ?\n\nIt made me doubt. I started searching \"gothic baby\" on Instagram to see if it would awaken something in me (being a goth myself I can only birth evil), I started dreaming about the both of us with a little girl wearing Dr Martens that I would initiate to my favourite bands and mosh with in the living room.\n\nNeedless to say, my head is a mess right now.

I would say maybe about four months after getting to know each other. Our relationship has been amazing. He is one of the most perfect people that I’ve ever met. We have such like goals and ideals, and we constantly talked about what our futures wanted to look like And how we wanted to grow as individuals in our careers and what we wanted from our relationship. The first year had been great. We did have some issues with my family and some other things simply because he is all allergic to cats and my family has cats so it’s made it pretty hard to have a well-rounded family relationship with him, but overall, we have worked through a ton of hurdles to be where we are today.\n\nIn the summer of 2024 I started my nursing program and everything had been doing really really well up until this past summer where I started to get really stressed, I was so mentally checked out. And I was really just focusing on getting through school one day at a time, he supported me very well through this and now with my schooling coming to an end we have started to have a few issues. The past month or so I was going through a lot and our sex life and intimacy has has kind of come to a decline. I do know that it is my fault because I’ve been the one pushing him away and we’ve had discussions about how it’s made him feel. I told him that I really just thought it was stress and the new birth control that I had gotten on and that it was really messing with my sex drive. I told him that I would fix it but have been waiting on an appointment to get things resolved. During this time, he has been trying to convince me to move into his apartment, which that has been really difficult because I didn’t wanna hurt my family‘s feelings since they have been really hesitant on the issue and I was trying not to upset either party.( my family is kinda strict when it comes to things like that due to how they were raised about certain things not happening before marriage) I’ve been slowly moving into his apartment and I thought things were going really great until earlier this week when he wanted to have a sit down conversation with me. He decided to tell me that for the past few months, he has started to resent me for the fact that we have had lack of intimacy. And that because of my stress level, and the things that I have going on, he has been putting his own goals and priorities to the side, which I feel really really weird about because he has never once brought that up to me before he also told me that he thinks that I’ve changed since the beginning of our relationship and I understand what he means by that simply because I used to be a very, very active person but because of school, I did have to put some of those things aside.\n\nWhen we had this discussion, I told him that he was right and that I would work on getting back into my old lifestyle now that things were getting better with school and I left like I could get back to myself. Things would definitely take a turn because I would have more time for him in therefore I would be able to support him now that he no longer has to support me when it comes to school and stress he agreed that he would be patient and that we could work through this, but then the very next day he did a total 180 and told me that he would like to go on a break. And I don’t mean just like a regular break he means a whole one month no contact break because he needs to work out his feelings and put himself first and he believes that I have made it to where there’s no room for him left in my life, which has never been the case.\n\nTL; DR- After almost three years of being together he asked for a break to rethink our relationship and his feelings about his place in my life along with his own goals after we made such a big decision to live together.\n\nHow do I respect his wishes but also try to keep our relationship alive? What does a break like this mean when I feel like I’ve been blindsided?\n\n(English only responses please)", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We've known eachother for two years and we've been very much into eachother for a long time, but now I asked her to start dating, she was hesitant but at the end she agreed. Just so you know, she can be very impulsive and somewhat needy sometimes, but at the end of the day she's not really a toxic person, quite the oposite actually, she's very caring and open about herself, never lies and always checks on others, she knows where her priorities are and is very beautiful and I love her, or at least I have very strong feelings for her. The thing is that despite us sharing a lot of stuff in commong, we aproach things very differently. I am a very closed off person, I think my attachment style is closer to being Disorganized, so yeah, I can be very needy and codependent but still being selfish, insecure and distant, which I know has made her very uneasy. On monday we were planing to go on a date to the museum, but when I checked the prices turned out the place is closed, so I told her we might have to change plans but still I wanna take her out, I send her a message telling her about the change of plans, but still hasn't responded (I know it's because she's on an out with friends, so her not responding soon isn't really the issue. The thing is, and we fought yesterday about this, I'm a very careless person, I am the kind of person who makes decisions and plans without thinking things throu, which leads to conflicts where she's unsure and insecure. I know I could be doing much better, but I'm very fearful, lazy and all in all a very frustrating person to deal with, I want her to feel seen but when I try I always relly on trying to empatize with throu experiences I've lived but that frustrates her more cuz it makes her feel like I'm directing the thing to myself, which is still true cuz I know I can be egocentric. I don't know how to show apreciation in a healthy way, and I know I need to go to the psycologist but I don't have the time or the money for that, I am fearful of hurting her, I don't want her to hate me nor do I want her to feel insecure, sad, fearful or anyting. I know I can't control her emotions, but I want to show her that I care. We're going on our first date and I feel like I already fucked up, this woman is truly someone I love and someone I want to spend all my time with and yet I choose not to spent as much time as I should, I struggle with comunication, taking iniciative, and she and I have discussed this already, but I'm going in circles on this already. I never know what can I do to take her on a regular date and she's done more than enough for this relationship, and she's so frustrated because she's giving her best and I'm not, and she's right. Guys, I'm really on the edge right here, please give me some advice, a wake up call, I know many of you will tell me I'm emotionally inmature or stuff like that, and I know many responses will asume I shouldn't drag her into my mess, and that's the least I want to do, I don't wanna get better just for her, I wanna be better for myself, cuz I want to prove myself I'm good enough, that not only I deserve love but that I can be better at giving love. Any advice will help, and sincerily thank you\n\n  \nTL,DR: My friend and I just started dating and I'm not being a good partner.

I was devastated, and confused at what I wanted. I had left a long term relationship and was exploring myself, feeling alive for the first time, and met him and fell really fast. \n\nBecause of his crisis and trauma, I never really got to deal with my sadness at the “infertility” and I just sorta stopped being careful and using protection.

We're from the same small town in Georgia, but I now live 4.5 hours away. Despite the distance, we've stayed super connected: visit one another every weekend, constant texting, and nightly calls. We've talked for months about moving in together and even looked at wedding rings.\n\nShe's *incredibly* independent—never asks for help, doesn't complain, and insists she can handle everything alone. I've always encouraged her to open up; she just shares facts without emotions.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, she hit a rough patch:\n\n* Needs a full hysterectomy with hormones at 47; initial surgery aborted due to complications, now heading to Mayo Clinic in FL.\n* Job as a 4th-grade teacher got chaotic under new principal: more kids, behavior issues, zero down time.\n* Father (whom she adored) passed away a few weeks ago; we were by his side.\n* A dear cousin died unexpectedly a week before her dad.\n* Financial struggles; she's taken a second night job at a hospital, working 7:30 AM to 11 PM most days/weekends. I've helped some financially.\n* Dramatic legal battle with stepmother over misappropriated funds from her dad; lots of lawyer meetings.\n\nDespite all this, and despite my repeated asking and reassurance, she's never leaned on me for support. Eventually, I've had no choice but to just trust her when she said she was fine.\n\nRecently, during a couple of moments of poor judgment, I voiced concerns about her 18-year-old son who lives with her. He's immature, rude, disrespectful, and messy—I expressed doubts about relocating to live in that environment (phrased very carefully, not harshly at all, I promise).\n\nImmediately, things cooled: texts halved, some days with minimal contact beyond good morning/goodnight. She's blamed busyness and stress, but admitted my comments made her rethink our future.\n\nA couple days ago, she melted down on the phone: she's spiraling, broken, unhappy with every aspect of her life, and needs space to fix herself alone. We talked for 1.5 hours; I offered support without trying to \"fix\" her, but she insisted on handling it solo, saying she's never taken time for herself.\n\nI'm a such a supportive man and want to help emotionally, spiritually, and financially. But now she's shut me out.\n\nTL;DR: GF under massive stress from health, job, family deaths, finances, and legal issues. After I raised concerns about her son, she's distanced herself and says she needs space to fix her life alone.

I need advice on what to do.\n\nMy girlfriend (18F) and I (20M) have been together for over 18 months now.\n\nShe is so amazing in so many ways. I genuinely never would've beleived I could find someone like her, but I did, and I could see myself spending the rest of my life with her... were it not for one thing.\n\nI'm genuinely feeling like she doesn't actually love me. It feels so horrible to say, but it's true. She barely shows any affection towards me at all.\n\nShe often doesn't look at me on dates, just stares forward or at her food. When on a date I try to put my full attention on her, while she almost always takes phone calls, sends texts and the like (she's very close with her mother, so not entirely her fault, bur still.)\n\nShe offered to cook for me one time, she got me a nice gift for my birthday and she put on a nice dress I'd been wanting to see her in for a while. Those are literally the only examples of explicit affection I can think of from the past 6 months.\n\nI won't list all the things I do for her, because it isn't a competition, but I will say it is much more than this.\n\nShe reciprocates whenever I hold her hand, hug her or kiss her, but she almost never initiates anything. She'll sit in my lap, but only if I ask (or if the seat is dirty), she'll play with my hair, but only if I ask, she'll cuddle up to me in bed, but only if I ask, etc.\n\nMy love language is very heavily physical touch (I was touch-deprived in my childhood for some currently irrelevant reasons) and it was supposedly hers too, but I'm not feeling it at all. I almost feel like I'm being *endured* by her. Like she's just *putting up* with my affection.\n\nThis really hurts, as I always pictured my relationship to be with a woman who will leap at me and smush her face into my chest whenever we see eachother. She is very much not like that.\n\nEven in bed, cuddling, she prefers to face away from me and for me to spoon her from behind. No hate on spooning, but with all this context, it always makes me feel like it's a metaphor for the way our relationship works.\n\nThis is only compounded by the fact that we haven't had sex yet. We discussed this at the very beginning of the relationship, and we're both okay with having it before marriage, but she said she would like to wait until her 18th birthday with it. It wouldn't have been illegal before then or anything, she just wanted it that way and I agreed. Well, her birthday came and passed, but nothing. She's not ready.\n\nI, of course, didn't push her. Each time this has come up, I always told her I only want it when she does too, otherwise there's no point. I still don't press her about it, but she's turning 19 in two months... and still not ready.\n\nI'm willing to wait as long as she needs, but it would be a lie to say this doesn't twist the knife even more. Especially since I'm a bit chubby and not happy with the way I look, while she is fit, healthy and drop dead gorgeous.\n\nThis, with all the other things really makes me feel unloved and unwanted in the relationship.\n\nI've recently opened up to her about this (maybe like 2 months ago or so) and we've had several discussions about it since. She's admitted to me that she's always had trouble showing affection to people, not just romantically but in every type of relationship in her life. She actually seemed very upset that this had happened with me too.\n\nShe said she would maybe need to see a therapist to work on it, and I supported her in that. We've been trying to pick one out for her since then.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because of a conversation we had today. She opened up to me about her previous relationship (she's my first, I'm her second). She didn't force the topic on me or anything, I encouraged her to open up, but this is essentially what she said:\n\nIn her previous relationship she felt very unloved and her previous boyfriend would often not want to hug her back or seemed uncomfortable in her presence. He also said he didn't find her phyiscally attractive and he never really made her feel special.\n\nSome of this I already knew, and I've always been furious with the idea of someone making my beloved angel feel like she was ugly or clingy. My blood boils even just thinking about it.\n\nWhat hurt my feelings though, was this; she tried to hug him. Tried to be close with him, and he pushed her away. Regularly.\n\nI could throw all my dignity away and beg on the floor for anything more than a short caress from her, but she gave this piece of shit guy active affection and closeness? Him not appreciating this is just the painful cherry on top.\n\nSince this was her vulnerable moment, I tried not to show how hurt I was, but she noticed pretty soon and asked about it, so I told her in the gentlest way possible.\n\nShe said sorry, gave me a hug and after that she had to go home (she was visiting me).\n\nAnd... I don't know, but to be honest I feel like it was a bit of a lackluster apology. Like I said, we've talked about this many a time already and she knows how much I crave to feel wanted by her. One time she actually made an effort to be more affectionate and I was the happiest I'd been in a very long time, but then things kinda went back to the way they used to be, instead of getting better gradually, like I'd hoped.\n\nWe've been planning to move in together about a year from now, and we agreed that this would be the year for us to figure out if we truly want to commit to eachother in this way. If yes, we move in, if not, we go our separate ways.\n\nAnd I still intend on keeping to that, letting this year play out to see if things improve... but I'm genuinely starting to lose faith that my girlfriend even loves me.\n\nI understand her trauma, and I believe her words telling me she does. But my heart doesn't. I brought this up to her after an argument recently where she got really mad at me over something I felt was quite minor. I was upset, and I told her \"I don't know if I believe you love me anymore\".\n\nIt's probably the harshest thing I've ever said to her, and one part of me regrets it, but another feels like it had to be said.\n\nWe talked about it. She cried. She said it felt horrible to imagine looking at me and telling me she loves me while knowing I don't beleive her. And to be honest, it broke my heart too. My eyes welled up with tears just now even from simply writing it down.\n\nBut I can't ignore this anymore. She says she can work on it and we can be happy together. I really hope so. But the longer we go on like this... the harder it gets to believe.\n\nAll the rationale points to her loving me. Why would she spend time with me weekly, why would she text with me every day, why would she stay in the door waving me goodbye after a date, etc. I'm not rich, I'm not hot, I'm not famous, and she's not that shallow of a person anyway.\n\nSo I ***know*** she loves me, but I don't ***feel*** it. And it's really starting to hurt, as I was hoping we'd have made some progress by now.\n\nI realize breaking up will always be an option, but I'd really rather not do that unless I've tried everything else. We have a healthy, stable and strong relationship in all other aspects. Just not this. I really don't want to throw it away and switch out my dream girl to someone else who might love me a little more but will suck in some other way.\n\nReddit... what do I do?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We have a long history of talking and not talking. We had never actually dated until now, but there have been strong feelings, albeit mixed at times, for over a year. We reconnected and started talking again this year. We are both seniors in college but attend different schools, so after we reconnected in person, we went long distance.\n\nAt the start of our talking stage, she told me that she was also talking to somebody else. It bothered me a little, but I decided to keep talking to her since it was early, and we weren’t officially dating. She’s perfectly entitled to act as she likes. In the past, whenever we were talking, it had been all or nothing, and this time was no different. We were FaceTiming every night for hours, constantly texting. She’s someone I really click with.\n\nShe would still see this other guy here and there, and I wasn’t happy about it but tried not to bring it up. Neither of us were ready to start a long-distance relationship, especially given our history and the trust that had been broken in the past. This went on until I invited her to my frat formal in April. We spent the weekend together, and it was magical. We had such a good time together; it felt like we were constantly laughing and talking. I’ve never felt so close to anyone. She told me that she loved me, and I told her the same.\n\nWhen we were out at the bars the last night, she told me that she had hooked up with the other guy and wanted to be honest with me about it. I wasn’t happy, but I was drunk, so I kind of forgot about it. Before I took her to the airport, we had a long talk about what we thought about us going forward. She said she wanted to keep talking but didn’t want to start dating until the summer because she didn’t want to start a relationship while it was long distance (we would be in the same city over summer break). I was ready to start dating her, but after hearing what she said, I didn’t really speak up. I told her that I “didn’t like her seeing that other guy,” and she said she would end it “soon.” She was coming up again in a month, and she said it would be before then.\n\nOver that month, she hung out with him two more times, but then she told me she ended it. She also went on a first date, which she now tells me was just “for fun” and a last first date before dating me. She made out with the guy (she told me, saying that she wanted to always be honest with me).\n\nWhen she came back to the city, we again had a great time, but she got really drunk one night, and I had to take her to the hospital. The next morning, she told me that she was so thankful I took care of her and that she was ready to date me because I really am a great guy, going back on her claim to wait until summer. I went down to her city after the weekend and asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes.\n\nThe next day, she told me two things: that she was blacked out and kissed the guy the day before she came back to my city, and that she “wasn’t always going to choose me.” She said that before we went on the first trip together, she thought she was going to choose the other guy, but as the trip approached, he stopped putting in as much effort. After the trip, she said she had decided on me.\n\nI don’t know, that stung because, in my mind, I felt like she was saying I was the second option and that we’re only dating now because this other guy dropped the ball. That remark and her hooking up with other people for a long time after we started talking, along with her going on that first date after telling me she loved me, still stick in my head after 5 months of dating. I know that we weren’t dating, and she was well within her rights to do whatever she wanted, but it still bothers me. Since we started our relationship, she has been phenomenal—she hasn’t talked to the other guy, given me no reason not to trust her, and has been super caring and loving. That makes it worse when I get these intrusive thoughts about the past and feel upset with her.\n\nI don’t know, am I being crazy? I would love some outside opinions. My thoughts are that I should’ve definitely set more clear boundaries and told her that I wanted to start dating after she came up to see me the first time. I didn’t, and now here we are. Honestly, the things that stick in my head the most are her going on that first date and her telling me that she wasn’t planning on choosing me. I just wish she hadn’t told me all of that stuff. I understand her wanting to be honest with me, but I also feel like the things she did while we were just talking are none of my business, to be honest. If she had kept it to herself, things would be easier.\n\nThanks in advance for reading all of that.\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend telling me everything she was doing during our talking stage still weighting on me during relationship.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I consider her in everything I do and at times have lived to make her life easier and better. I’ve also been in therapy for 5 years, worked on myself, and grown a lot emotionally. She wants me to stay because she knows I’m a very good partner to her though I have my flaws like anyone else. I don’t feel like she’s a good partner to me however.\n\nI’ve encouraged her to do therapy and heal and take care of herself (so she can then learn how to take care of me), and she’s only just now starting this process.\n\nBut she doesn’t consider me the way I consider her. She rarely compliments me, doesn’t try to make me feel attractive (though I get attention from other girls here and there-I only want it from her), doesn’t do the little things that show effort or appreciation. On top of that, she people-pleases in social situations and sometimes puts me down to lift others up. Or just chooses to please others over me all together. She admits this but hasn’t figured out how to stop yet.\n\nAfter 8 years, I’m just drained. I love her, but I don’t feel seen or valued. I keep wondering: if I haven’t felt confident enough to propose by now, is that my gut telling me this isn’t right? I’ve talked to some older guys some divorced and some not. They have basically said if it’s a dealbreaker leave. But I’m scared. My whole life I feel like has been with her. I don’t know anything else. Im scared of the pain the hurt maybe the mistake of leaving. Do I leave and find a partner who meets me halfway? I feel like there might be someone who is better to me. But maybe she can learn? It’s so hard to know.\n\nThere are lot of context here so ask way. I’ll add that the way wives seem to feel about their husbands kinda doing nothing and basically carrying the entire mental load - that’s exactly how I feel. Idk if other men are in dynamics such as this so please as a man in this type of dynamic - weigh in for me.\n\nWould love some outside perspective.\n\nTL;DR: Together 8 years (25M/24F). I do a lot to care for her and support her, but I don’t feel seen, appreciated, or valued in return. She’s only starting therapy now while I’ve been working on myself for years. I’m drained, not sure if I should propose or accept this isn’t the right relationship and move on.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/That_2nf_account_1385", "user": "u/That_2nf_account", "text": "My (27f) boyfriend (35m) changed his mind about our marriage timeline without telling me.\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend decided he wants to wait longer to get married but didn’t tell me and I’m not sure where to go from here or if I am overreacting \n\nSo we have been dating for nearly 2 years and marriage has been a conversation pretty much from the beginning, especially since he is on the older end. For several months the plan was marriage summer of 2026 and that a proposal would be sometime between this summer and now (just not in the week leading up to my sister’s wedding which took place last week lol). I have told several people about this rough timeline, including people asking me at my sister’s wedding, which he did attend and was present for many of these conversations, including one on the phone with my mom while we were driving home from the wedding, with it being a 12 hour driving trip.\n\nWell we haven’t even looked at rings. We’ve talked about it and I have hinted occasionally when we have walked by a jewelry store, which happened yesterday. It made me worried so that evening when we got back to his place (we do not live together and do not intend to until marriage/right before for religious reasons but I do stay there on weekends because it is a bit of a drive) I asked him what was going on.\n\nFirst he said it was because over the summer he started looking into rings when I was out of town but got overwhelmed but then I said that doesn’t make sense and that’s why you go to a ring store together so you can work with a pro for help and get an idea of what I like. So after that and then asking if anything else was going on, he finally admitted he wants to push things back another year.\n\nThe reasoning he gave is because he has a cousin getting married next June and another in September and he’s worried about another wedding in the mix being too much for those family members. My stance is this is a huge life event and that there will always be other things going on and reasons to delay. It’s also not stuff with his actual immediate family and there seems to be plenty of room between these weddings anyway, but wanting to move the timeline isn’t even the biggest issue for me here. This is:\n\nI asked him how long he’s thought this, apparently he started having doubts over the summer and then really felt hit with it mid august when he was at a wedding (I did not attend due to work and travel expenses) and family was asking him questions and one person made a comment about how it would be hard for her to attend everything financially, that we haven’t been dating long enough, and that we should live together first. I personally feel she was a little out of line as he didn’t ask for this advice. \n\nHe ended up telling his mom he wanted us to now wait until next summer. But did not tell me until I forced it out of him last night. At first he said it’s because he didn’t have a chance to tell me but that’s not true. There was a whole weekend before I left for my sister’s wedding to tell me (I understand not saying anything the week of), and the 12 hour car ride back and even the times we hung out before the conversation.\n\nInstead he let me just go around telling all of these people this timeline he had no intention of following and now I’m embarrassed and upset we aren’t on the same page and I love his mom but it’s also something I feel he should have brought to my attention first or at least the next time we saw each other after we got back from my sister’s wedding. And if I hadn’t asked, who knows how long this would’ve gone on? And that’s what really scares me. He had an issue, and chose not to communicate it with me. He hates conflict, but he chose avoiding conflict over my feelings and over figuring out something I’d say is pretty important. And if he won’t tell me this is an issue, then what else might be a problem and he’s just not telling me? Or what else might I think we are on the same page with and actually are not?\n\nWe talked and talked but nothing is resolved. I stayed calm and voiced my feelings, both about not being told, and the timeline change in general but I have no idea if he has changed his mind or not and nothing instilled any sort of confidence that if there’s any sort of future problem in our relationship that he’ll come to me about it and I won’t have to force it out of him.\n\nI love him and think we could have a great life together but this is really worrying me. So what should I do next? Just next time we’re together, come up with another timeline and hope for the best? If he really feels like next summer is too much, why not push back just 6 months instead of a year?

After tough years and some personal mistakes on my part, we’ve talked, I’ve forgiven her, and we’re working on rebuilding trust and exploring a more open sexual lifestyle together.\n\n\nNew to Reddit and First-Time Posting (Apologies in Advance)\nI’ll start in the middle because that’s how my brain is working these days. Back in May, I found out that my wife had an affair with someone from her childhood. It all started when I went to pick her up after a night out with her friends. As usual, she had trouble controlling her alcohol consumption. I brought her home, helped her get into bed—the usual husband duties.\nOn the way to bed, she dropped her phone. When I picked it up, I saw some explicit messages. While she was very drunk, I looked through her phone and discovered that she had had an affair a few weeks earlier with a high school boyfriend. The ironic part is that I had organized the vacation and arranged her accommodation, supporting her to take a few days to unwind from the daily grind of work, kids, and life.\n\nI did feel a bit uneasy about her going away because I didn’t know him, but at the time, I trusted her.\nLooking back over the past ten years, life has been hard. Without support from our extended families, we’ve been raising three kids, some with health issues. This took a big toll on our friendship and mental health. While she managed most of the household responsibilities, I buried myself in work. Naturally, our relationship shifted from husband and wife to more like flatmates, focused on survival rather than connection.\nI have to acknowledge that I wasn’t the best partner over the last decade. I wasn’t always present emotionally, and I didn’t always handle things well. I can’t fully blame her for what led to the affair.\n\n\nAfter a very aggressive and violent night of yelling and shouting from both of us, she took the kids and went to her parents’ place for safety. While I was still in an emotional rollercoaster, I reached out to the wife of the affair partner and shared what I knew. This brought me some relief and clarity about the future. I regret any pain I caused her, but I couldn’t let it go.\n\nSince then, after long conversations with my wife, I’ve come to understand the kind of sexual and lifestyle exploration she craves. I realized that I am happy to share and experience this with her, as long as it’s open and without secrets.\n\nLong story short, I’ve forgiven my wife and understand what led her to have an affair. I’m taking life day by day, trying not to dwell on the loss of trust. I do believe we are good for each other, and if we keep communicating and working hard, we can have a great life ahead.\n\nIf anyone actually read this far, I really appreciate your time and patience.

I think I will leave her alone for now and then reach out in maybe 1.5 to 2 weeks. But I would love some advice. I’m really scared of losing her. \n\n\nTLDR: my partner wants to take a break, but didn’t specify what that entails.

Most normal hours job women can easily do both. But not mine. I didn't like it that he sees my schooling as not important, and should just cancel it all, and how sees me barely keeping it together with this job until I quit, yet he wants me to continue working, marry him, and have his kids?.

But lately he'll tell me he'll be free for the whole day during the weekends but then end up being busy with stuff he decided to do last minute and he doesn't give me a heads up when he leaves and only responds with short answers. And ik it seems like he'd be cheating but I have his location and he's always at public locations so if he is its in public.\n\nNow jumping to what's really frustrating me recently is that 2 days ago was our 3 month anniversary of when we became official and he promised me the day before that he'd be home by 7-8 at the latest cuz he knew that I needed to go to bed earlier than I had been since I'm starting a new job. And I had made sure to have everything done at my house so I could be free all night with him, and I was already kinda down since he didn't really text me back much during the day. But there I was sitting on my bed doomscrolling waiting for something from him. He finally texted me back shortly before 9:30 saying he was on his way home, asking if I wanted to call when he got home. But at that point I was just fed up and wanted sleep cuz it was 30 minutes past my bed time so I just said I was going to bed soon. I honestly wasn't even that upset about him being out so late its just that he couldn't send me one text saying shit came up and he was going to be home late. \n\nAnd the next day he kept apologizing and asking if I was mad but honestly I just felt nothing about it. I felt numb about the whole thing, like it wasn't the first time so I kinda expected it. But now I just kinda feel numb about him too, and he asks if I'm upset about something but I'm not i just really dont feel anything about him right now. I'm planning to talk to him about this but I don't know if there's something else I can do to help me feel literally anything about him or about us.

I’ve planned and paid for almost everything for her trip.\n\nBut last weekend something happened that’s left me really shaken. She told me she was going to sleep early, but the next day she admitted (only after I confronted her multiple times!!!) that she had actually gone out partying with friends, including some guys and used party drugs. At first she denied it, got angry when I asked, and then slowly admitted the truth. Even now, some things don’t add up (like her timeline of when she got home vs. when she finally answered me).\n\nShe swears she didn’t cheat, and she’s asking me to give her a last chance. But I can’t shake the feeling that she’s still hiding things. I feel hurt, betrayed, and stuck between not wanting to throw away a year together and also not knowing if I can trust her anymore.\n\nSo here’s my question...  \n  \nShould I still go through with this trip and meet her, or should I cancel and walk away from hard-built 1 year LDRS?\n\nNote - We were okay with our LDR until this point.

This guy took photos of me without me realising, he even took a photo of window of where I was staying, to some this may seem silly and pointless but it’s because it meant something to him. I didn’t want to lead him on, I told him I didn’t feel anything for him romantically and that we could just be friends to which I really hurt him.\n\nIt was hard to make a decision that quickly on my feelings as I was only there for a week, it was too much pressure, I didn’t want to hurt him, so I thought the best thing was to just say no basically. But then my feelings towards him changed and I decided to stop being an idiot and give him a chance, things developed between us. I apologised to him many times on how I was in the beginning, being unsure of my feelings and hurting him.\n\nHe had wrote my a letter, the night I told him I didn’t have feelings for him, dedicating a song to me that is about someone’s love that is irreplaceable, unforgettable, nothing compares to the feelings they felt with that person. Ending the letter ‘maybe in another life we could be something more’. He gave this to me after my feelings had changed.\n\nWhen I got home, we decided to carry things on, these are just some of the things he said- sleeping together was beautiful, how can he forget my eyes, he can’t explain the feelings he has and the way I make him feel, what happened was too strong and too beautiful to only last for a short time, I’d ruined him, I’m his, he was away with his friends but he felt like apart of him was missing and he said it was me, these things and so many other things he said to suggest that he wanted to have something with me. He was always so thoughtful and caring, he wanted to know everything about me, open up to him, to which I really tired to. He just seemed to be able to read me, know me so well already. He said he wanted to do things right with me, be open and honest with each other, he wanted to take care of me and be there for me, he didn’t want us to end. We would speak all day every day, and most nights for hours, about everything and anything. The things we wanted to do together, we missed each other, couldn’t wait to be with each other again, to feel each other.\n\nBefore I saw him again we had an argument, I asked him what he wanted from me and how he saw us and if there was a possibility of a relationship, because of the distance etc, as he didn’t seem to be putting in the effort like he did before in regards to seeing me, and my feelings were continuing to grow for him, I just wanted clarity so I could go about my feelings accordingly. He was angry that I would accuse him of not wanting to see me. He told me that he told me from the beginning that he didn’t want a long distance relationship, he’s had one before and it didn’t work (he never told me this) but didn’t want to end what we had, so I said basically it’s just an ‘if and when’ friends with benefits type of thing, he didn’t like this at all, ‘what we had is much more than that’. But he said he was angry because until I brought it up he hadn’t thought about it, he just went day by day, and now I had made him think about ‘our’ future. He said that I am trying to end it because I’ve decided I don’t need him anymore, this hurt me, I opened up to him about how I was feeling, about how much I do need him, how much he already meant to me, and I was scared that I didn’t want it to end. We said we were going to enjoy our moments with each other like we did the last time and not worry about anything else.\n\nWhen I saw him, it was different, I held off because I knew he didn’t see a future with me, I wasn’t how I wanted to be with him, and he was definitely different with me, I didn’t feel the same ‘love’ from him to which I had felt the first time, and throughout the whole time until us meeting again, even after the argument. Looking back at how he was and how it felt, it was like he didn’t actually want to be with me, he met me out of principle. He only saw me for a few hours, I asked him to stay with me in the evening, as we had done once the last time, but he said he didn’t think it was a good idea after the conversation we had had. But he was okay to sleep with me when he saw me earlier on in the day? I was trying to enjoy our moments together like we both said, but it had seemed that he had changed his mind already.\n\nHe then ended it with me, he told me that mentally and physically he’s attracted to me, we had a spark mentally, he can talk to me for hours without getting bored; I’m perfect just the way I am, I’m an amazing person, beautiful etc etc. but when we slept together there was no spark, he felt nothing, he felt the same apparently when we slept together before, but never said anything. He wanted to try again as he thought my shyness before would have been a factor. He had realised he wanted a relationship, and with how he feels about our sexual relationship and the distance there was no point in carrying on. He had come to see me, but speaking after he said it was hard for him too, he said he had tears in his eyes as he wanted to have that feeling with me, he’s happy to have met me, he couldn’t have asked for more from life, I was this beautiful thing that life wanted to give him.\n\nBut there are reasons to why are spark might not have been there, as I have my personal issues to which I opened up to him about after. I’m angry that he just decided to end it like he did, not even talking to me about it first about he felt, after everything I felt he didn’t even try.\n\nI told him I respected that he ended it with me, and of course I would want to try again, but I knew from his side it was done. But after everything I didn’t want to lose him, I didn’t want to lose him as a friend as he had become such a big part of my life, he knows more about me than anyone else. Our romantic relationship hadn’t really had the chance to develop as we were physically together for a short time. He said no, we should end our relationship forever, mainly for me because I wouldn’t be able to move on, and that my feelings scared him. This made me angry, like what the fuck??? Everything we ever said and did was with deep feelings and emotions, always instigated by him. He did and said everything he could to make sure I had some sort of feelings for him and now it scares him? I got so mad, I questioned everything he ever did and everything he ever said to me, told him he had played me, fucked with my mind and my feelings. He knew from the very beginning where I lived, why pursue someone you know lives in a different country if you don’t want a long distance relationship. But he was still adamant he did everything with his heart.\n\nHis last message was awful, saying that he never told me he wanted a future with me, told me how he feels about long distance, he never thought he could have a future with me and never wanted it. His feelings have changed, he doesn’t feel anything for me, and doesn’t want anything from me, if I want to accept it fine, otherwise he’s going to move on anyway.\n\nCan someone please help me move on, how can he just switch, just like that?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/Sensitive_brush_381_1414", "user": "u/Sensitive_brush_381", "text": "I'm going crazy. F 22\n\nHi! Me and my \"situationship\" (M, 23) met on April 19th on a dating app. We live 300 miles/500 km apart. I know it's not that big of a distance, I guess, but still. We started texting. The chemistry was crazy good. After a few days of texting, I proposed a date so we could finally talk in person. Then he told me that he is between jobs at the moment and he doesn't have any money. It's so bad that he had to move back to his parents. So I said fine (maybe my first mistake?) and we continued talking. We shared a lot of stuff about each other: traumas, crazy stories, political and philosophical stuff, etc. I was kicking my feet whenever I got a text from him. He shared moments with me that he had with his daughter. (Yes, he has a daughter at 23, and he and the mom separated. Maybe a second red flag?) I felt like he kind of became part of my life and I his. We played League of Legends together. We sent each other TikToks. It was great.\n\nSo, fast forwarding to August, he got a job at a factory. We were so happy. We already planned our first date and everything, now that he would get a paycheck in September. We agreed to go to a big city which is halfway for both of us. We also agreed to rent a room (red flag number #3?) and sleep together. No sex, as I made it clear that I won't be having sex with him on our first date (I am a virgin, so a little scared haha). He was fine with it. He said he just wants to cuddle me.\n\nFast forward to September. He got his paycheck, but the planning spirit kinda died down. I always felt that whenever I asked him about his work schedule, he was bothered. He always said that he would look at it later (red flag #4?). So I didn't push it, but I was so impatient. I started dreaming about him even.\n\nSo, last week we didn't talk much. He later told me that he picked up an extra shift at work. He works 2x12-hour shifts and then has a day of rest. So he worked Monday, Tuesday, got home at 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then went to work again Thursday 6 p.m. and Friday. We last exchanged words (I can't really call it talking; it was really a quick exchange) Thursday. So I waited patiently while still sending pictures of stuff, the funny things that happened that day, etc., to him on Facebook Messenger. Three days have passed and I am still left on delivered as I am writing.\n\nToday (Sunday) I was getting a little worried, so I sent \"Everything alright?\" I didn't get an answer yet. I'm kind of sad. Now, we went a few days before without talking, but never like this. Whenever we didn't talk, neither of us texted, but now I am left on delivered for 3 days. So I started digging. He was online on Facebook Messenger countless times since. He also saw the last TikTok I sent on Friday, and he reposted a video on Friday as well. Next, I opened the dating app we met on, as I kept the app and my profile, but turned it incognito, as I was focused on this guy. And maybe, just maybe, I have looked at his profile on it sometimes to see if he was online, which he was a lot actually lol. (Red flag #5) Which reminds me that his phone died a couple of weeks ago. So I was happy seeing that he was online 7+ days ago. Sadly, after he got a new one, he became quite active on it again, but I couldn't tell him to quit because we are not a couple yet—or at least that was my thought process.\n\nSo here we are. I hope I can talk to him, but honestly, I am losing hope with every passing minute. I feel like three days is more than enough for someone to text a \"I won’t be available for a few days, sorry\" or something along those lines. And when I see the whole picture, I feel kind of ignored. Am I overreacting? I kinda made my peace with him, so if he doesn't turn up soon, I am leaving. Thank you for reading all this.

I’m relatively new to LDR of this extent (5 hour flight, 3 HR time difference). We did date/talk for 7 months in person before he moved and we decided to do LDR. My question is sometimes I find it difficult to trust him due to a multitude of reasons. Reasons include: my own insecurity and recent discovery my ex has been possibly falling for a friend and jumped into pursuing her soon after things ended, he (current bf) changed his hinge location twice while we were in exclusive but not yet dating or deciding to do LDR phase (but did not talk or meet up w anyone that I know of), and thirdly my own general insecurity of feeling like he’s out of my league. Usually, he’s very good with making me feel loved and secure, and he’s very transparent with where he is/what he’s doing. We share locations, occasionally check in via text while we’re working, and call or FT nightly usually. He informs me of plans and I’ve met his roommate and roommates wife. However, I still find myself at times being anxious that he might be cheating or pursuing other women, and I think the distance makes it worse. He hasn’t done anything suspicious outright, but changes in texting tone and consistency are some things that can set me off. That coupled with the fact that we have no mutuals and met less than a year ago makes me question him more than someone like my ex who I knew from school and was able to see multiple times a week because we lived in the same town. We don’t usually “fight” about situations where I feel insecure or anxious , and some of them are valid. For times sake I won’t go into every single time, but I usually bring them up, and he is patient with explaining himself. However, he’s expressed some hurt that I don’t “100%” trust him the way he trusts me and knows my heart. I realize my own insecurity plays a part in this.

Everything was sweet and healthy between us. A new guy met her last week for a hackathon. He talks really sweetly and decently, and flirts with her as well. She is now blaming me that I am not as sweet as him and have not given her physical support like staying with her physically and she is missing out on a lot of things in this relationship.\n\nMy Girlfriend and I have been the best friends and truest with each other since high school. I visit my girl every 2-3 months. She is immensely sweet, innocent and trusts anyone who treats her well. I was about to go back to her in a year or maximum 2years. We were planning to convince our parents for marriage and I was working hard to clear an entrance exam for my masters so that i can get a good college near her hometown and get a high paying job and settle in life and together we will get married.\n\n Last week, a guy in her college came up to her with regard to ask her to participate in their team in a hackathon organised in her college. She told me everything about this guy as she never hides anything from me. She told me that this guy is really sweet, talks so decently and is really well-mannered. I was like ok, if anyone is behaving nice with her i dont have any problem with that. Things got nasty when despite knowing that she is my girlfriend, he continued flirting with her, advising her that she deserves better and asking her whether she would like to start a new journey or go back to old one. My innocent girlfriend got really impressed with his way approaching her and now she is asking me why i am not as decent as him, and telling me  \"it's been 4 years of LDR, you have only given me emotional support but not physical support, you stay so far from me and I am starting to realize I am missing out on so many things in life.\" I told her not to talk to him as he is trying to take her away from me, but she says we are only close friends. I ask her what is the need to have a male friend when I am there for her. I tell her how can you forget all the happy moments we spent together and dreams of marriage we saw together because of some random guy. She says she doesn't know.  \n\n\nThen we had series of fights in call and lots crying and shouting throughout the week. She says that due to long distance she gets attracted to others but she loves me.

So basically we used to go the same school then I moved schools then when I was 15 I got his insta handle and we started texting as friends and we liked each other but didn't work out ..fast forward to when we were 18 , we got back together and we were mature and knew how relationships work and it was going well I mean very well . He was such a green flag my friends used to be jealous of me for having such a perfect guy ,I mean he was my dream guy never yelled at me , didn't check out girls, was a good friend to everyone a good son a good brother etc... he used to gift me stuff ,get me flowers , give me attention, was emotionally available, also he has a very good kind heart . He loves me so much . But I did see in Instagram and tiktok about how the honeymoon period doesn't last and I often used to think well I'm so lucky he still treats me like that ,I mean he was so perfect , he would never lose interest or stop doing all the efforts and work that he put into the relationship. Now talking about me I am head over heels in love with this guy ,i love him so much ... I have never loved anyone like this I mean I didn't know u could love a person like this he's my world ... I mean I just can't live without him I mean I can but it would be so hard ... I would never be happy ...he is the love of my life . We are doing long distance but he still takes out time for me calls me texts me ... He never ignores me and I also don't ignore him . Of course we do have arguments but we solve it right then and there . We we fought we always try to make it right again rather than our ego taking over . He was so innocent. Sometimes when we argue he says sorry even I am the one in the wrong and eventually time passed after one year and 3 months I don't know what happened he started acting different like ,he would call me text me and do all that but he kind of started getting busy , I mean I understand that we are doing long distance of course he has a life there but I just missed how he was at the beginning moreover that we are in college and we need to focus rather than calling and texting each other all the time I totally understand that but I just miss how it used to be before ... Some examples will most of the days he forgets to text me goodnight, or not watch the reels I send him , he used to be the first person on my insta share ( he isn't now)and I used to like all these things even though it wasn't that big a deal I liked it . Sometimes I felt like he was ignoring me or whatever and also I noticed something different in the way he behaved ,it was not the old him . Like after a week or so I asked him whether he was okay and then he said he was I asked him again after two days he replied the same . I asked him what changed and he was always like what the hell are you talking , I kind of felt like he was falling out of love with me , idk maybe I am just overthinking cause he loves me that much \nFinally he said that he was going through something and he doesn't know what it is and and he will get himself out of it so he just needs time and I didn't know how I could help him so I was like okay I understand u take ur time . Then I started checking in with him regularly and he said he was getting better this went around for two months and he was acting the same much worse it's like we had lost all the spark and connection we had . One day I texted him saying idk what's happening to u or whatever but it's kinda affecting me bad and I said to him that u are also not telling me what's going on and he kinda got angry at me saying what's ur probelm just give me some time ...i meAn I wAnted to give him time but it was eating me alive ..Nd I kinda got sad he was angry at me and I didn't have time to read and hear rest of the messages cause I was in college by the time I reached home he deleted all of it and said sorry and I told him I never read the rest of it and he was like no u don't need to and he said sorry for the way he was acting and it got sorted out . Then one time I went out with him and idk I still felt that thing ... I didn't feel the connection we used to have ..one thing that really made me sad that day was he used to care for me like a baby and always held my hand while crossing roads this time he just crossed by himself and I asked him from there like why he didn't hold my hand and he said sorry like a 100 times I was like it's ok\nFor anyone reading u may think oh what's the big deal like other girls out there are getting cheated on or something I know i know that I have a good guy it's just that I miss what we had , idk or he just became comfortable with me that he felt like he didn't need to put that much efforts . I did confront him about all the other things he was doing and he always puts the blame on me idk what to do I didn't change after two years I still am very nice to him and treat him good I still talk to him and flirt with him like we used like the time we started dating.... Even after the first fight we still had many fights on this . I try to understand that he is busy , but it's just me waiting for his call or text and another new thing about him that pisses me off is that sometimes he acts like a hypocrite like he won't do that for me but sometimes expects me to do it . Idk what to i can't breakup with him for this I think because noone will consider this as an actual issue but it kinda has been ruining my mental health for 7 months . I'm so committed to him and I can't leave him for this . And he will be so heartbroken if I leave him idk even if i leave him ever I won't date anyone else cause hes my first love ,I will always love him . I can't physically or mentally love another man . Ever .it's either him or noone \n\nQuestion:\nThis has been affecting my mental health, but I don’t want to break up over it.\nHow can I communicate my needs without making him feel attacked?\nWhat steps can I take to figure out if this relationship is still healthy for me long term ?", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

The first time I saw her was in a scout group—we were in the same team. Our leaders randomly picked one male and one female to help in the kitchen. I was cutting potatoes while she was cutting onions, and I suggested she put on glasses to protect her eyes. That’s when everything started.\n\nWe began talking about school. I’m in university, and she was in her 3rd year of high school (that’s how our education system works, so pardon me). I tried to give her some advice, but I didn’t show any signs of being in love with her. On the other hand, she was humble, social, and made an effort to talk to me. She even said I seemed a little antisocial with the group. (I had been a scout member from 2017 to 2022, then quit for two years before returning in 2025. A lot had changed, and there were many new faces.) She also mentioned how people saw me as an “old man” because of my beard and the way I spoke—I looked more like a 25-year-old compared to most scouts, who were around 16–18.\n\nAfter the camp, I followed her on Instagram. I usually just reacted to her stories, replied to her notes, sent her motivational messages, or tried to make her laugh. Sometimes, I offered her a ride. But I still find it almost impossible to start a full conversation out of nowhere—like just saying “Hello, how are you?” and continuing from there. I’m still learning, but I’m afraid of making the wrong move or hurting her feelings.\n\nI’m not the type of guy who wants a temporary relationship—it feels inappropriate to me. I only believe in true love that can turn into marriage. I don’t want to lose her. I want her by my side. Right now, I’m obsessed with her, which makes me even more afraid to ask simple questions. The way she tries to talk to me gives me reasons to hold on to her and fight for her—I’d sacrifice anything for her.\n\nI’ve already done small favors for her, even when she didn’t ask. She would just talk about her struggles, and I tried to help however I could.\n\nNow, she’s added me to her Close Friends list on Instagram (where private stories are shared), but I still feel like I’m far from her—I’m not in her true inner circle.\n\nIn 2025–2026, she’ll be in her final year of high school (what we call BAC in my country). It’s a very important and sensitive year for every student, and I don’t want to be an obstacle for her. I want to support her. I really want to be with her. So… what should I do? Can someone please give me advice? I know dating young can be difficult, maybe even impossible, but I don’t want to give up too early. I want to prove to her how much I love her and how deeply I’m willing to sacrifice for her.\n\nExcuse me for the long paragraphs, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible so you can give me better advice. Even small tips would mean a lot to me.\n\nTake care, and have a good day, ladies and gentlemen.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Prior to this we’d kissed, cuddled and had physical touch. Despite me asking him to have sex and telling him I’m ready, he told me he didn’t want to have sex at that point because he knew that I had an anxious attachment style. He was concerned us having sex and being intimate would make me more attached to him than if we take things slow. After I asked he told me “You’re not ready” and I said “How do you know?” to which his response was “Because I have an idea and know what’s healthy for you”. Fast forward to us having sex for about 4 weeks, twice a week, things were healthy and he was always very sweet and affectionate, texting me throughout the day, and checking up on me. Whenever we hung out he would get me an Uber there, an Uber home, order me food etc. I hung out with him one time because I was feeling sad and he let me come over and just held me, no expectations of sex and talked to me and stay the night with him. Today he texted me saying he wouldn’t be able to hangout tonight after making plans last night and saying he was excited to see me. I didn’t respond and he then called me and asked if I saw his text. I told him I did, but didn’t get the chance to respond. He then went on to say he doesn’t think he can see me anymore. He feels like his mind is too consumed with us having sex and it’s distracting him and effecting his work. He said he thinks about it obsessively. The last time we saw each other he specially told me he didn’t want to have sex that morning because he wanted a clear head space going into the day and to be productive at work, but we did because I asked a few times (I didn’t think he was being serious he was walking around naked and kissing me…that was dumb of me to assume), and he said he couldn’t focus at work and was distracted all day. I know he’s told me before he’s trying to focus on getting a new position in his career, working out, eating healthy and just building healthy habits overall. I’ve sent him explicit pictures and videos to which he’s been open about masturbating to and he said he’s trying to break this habit because he feels like it’s “bad” to be in that mindset. He ended the call by saying “I think the world of you and I still want to be here for you so if you need anything you can text me, and as much as I’d like to be friends I don’t think I can do that right now because I can’t control myself around you?” He said he was going to talk to his therapist about it and these feelings.

Drinks alone at home before I get there to go out, then 5 drinks when out. Sometimes the car swerves or goes over the shoulder. Anyhow it’s been a year and we see each other 3 days a week.

Tried saying I’d appreciate if he could just text he made it home. Nope. One night he was out, I texted at like 10p that I had an awful work day, he claimed he was talking to his 5 year old nephew?? I said no prob call me when done. He totally disappeared, no call no text. Went to his apartment & car not there. Said in the AM I’d been worried. He said “I just went home and went to sleep.” I said “oh well your car wasn’t there” and suddenly the story change to he’d slept at his bro’s, which was total opposite direction from where he’d been out. Asked his buddy’s wife whom he’d gone out with if he’d crashed with them, she was like omg no and my hubby was home by 8pm. \n\nSo next weekend same thing, he’s going out and it’s “just the guys.” At midnight I text him “hey it’s a lot of nights you’ll just completely disappear till next day and I tried to express it’d be great to at least text you got home safe but never happens.” Over this he broke up with me, calling me “f*cking insecure” and a “psycho.”\n\nAnother time he said totally swamped w work, could meet me for a drink at the bar (all our dates are around alcohol & other people). Got there first, met a girl who just started dating my BF’s new friend from this bar. She casually says my BF was “at her house” earlier that day.

Both of our profiles said we were looking for a long-term relationship. From the start, he was very complimentary about my looks, and I told him I wanted to make sure he knew I wasn’t looking to mess around. He  said he understood and that he was genuinely into me. \n\nOn our first date, he drove an hour and a half to take me out to dinner. We had amazing chemistry, and ended up hooking up. It was great- I hadn’t had sex in months, and I wanted to. The next day he texted saying I was “amazing” and “worth an even longer drive.” He drove down again the next week — we spent about 8 hours together, had dinner, watched a movie, and hooked up again. We were texting every day — flirty, affectionate texts as well as just daily check-ins and references to things we’d do together. If I felt like I was too excited over text, he’d promise me that he didn’t want me to be more chill and that we were mutually ‘not chill’ about the connection. \n\nWe then went two weeks without seeing each other as I worked nights. We had plans for a Saturday, and I let him know that my plans Friday had changed and asked if he wanted to hang out both days. Out of nowhere, he texted: “What would you say the end goal with us is?” I asked him to call, and on the phone he said he’s had a hard time with relationships, doesn’t want commitment, and doesn’t want to lead me on if he isn’t 100% sure it’ll go somewhere.

Up until 3 weeks ago we finally started seeing eachother outside of the gym (where we met). I asked her out about a week after we first met and she denied me. I could tell from our interactions she was into me so let’s just say I played my cards right, and now here we are.\n\nI have been with my fair share of ladies. Nothing crazy, but enough to say I have my experience. I have never in my life felt the same way about someone this early on as I do with her. I feel like a teenager again. Seriously makes me reconsider my past relationships.\n\nHow do you guys who have been in these situations even handle these feelings? I’ll be at work and she will just pop into my mind. I’ll be cooking food and I’ll just be thinking about her. Sometimes it’s all I can think about\n\nIm not the love bomb type but I feel like half the time we are having a conversation I just want to give her a hug. How do I care about someone this much this early on?\n\nNow the second question of the post:\n\nShe has invited me to a few group hangouts with other people that we know from the gym. During these hangouts, her and I keep it very lowkey. Only a few of her friends know that we are seeing eachother and we don’t really show a lot of affection. I genuinely believe the majority have no clue. Part of this I believe is due to one of her good guy friends being obsessed with her. He’s been friend-zoned a few times but I don’t think the reality has fully hit him yet. \n\nIt’s a weird situation but it’s also exciting because I have never experienced it. We will go from acting like we hardly know when there is a room full of people to these incredibly flirty moments that feel like we are just releasing all these bottled up emotions when we have to room to ourselves. It fascinates me.\n\nHave any of you guys experienced these things? And how would you go about it moving forward. I’m sure as time goes on her friends will become aware of what’s happening, or we will tell just tell them. But her taking over my brain is insane.

We were constantly texting (everyday, all the time) each other, have similar hobbies and personalities…it felt like we were a great match (ok, it often feels like this in the beginning, right?) At some point, we realized we started developing feelings for each other, but could not meet because of business trips, life, traveling (holidays). FYI, we live in the same country, but different states. \n\nWe finally met on July, and everything was great. He stayed for the weekend in my town, we connected well, had dates, got intimate and so on. Then, he invited me to spend the next weekend at his place, and ofc, I went. \n\nAgain, everything went fine/great (we had one disagreement, but everything was fine on the next days). Once I left his place, he told me he really enjoyed spending time with me, that it was weird to be by himself again and etc. So, I took that as a progress in our “getting to know each other” situation/phase…but after our second meeting/date (!!) things got cold. He wouldn’t act romantic/caring anymore, was texting less, less interested…to make things worse, I also had to go abroad again for a business trip, and will only return on October. \n\nSince then, our texting reduced drastically and we even had an one week gap of silence (drama! Haha)…I recently texted him asking how he was doing, but after few exchanges, things went back to silence…\n\nTo be fair with him:\n- he is going through a career change.\n- I am abroad for a (long) business trip.\n- he was also in a business trip and busy with work.\n- I know that texting can get dull after some time.\n\nBut my questions are:\n- Do you think I should talk to him and ask if something is wrong? Or should I wait until I am back (and see how he behaves?)? \n\n- Does texting less means less interested? \n\nI have anxiety attachment, and I know I should not judge a person or a relationship based on texting…but I feel very confused haha.\n\nAlso, English is not my first language, so my writing might look a bit weird haha.

{"id": "u/[deleted]_1470", "user": "u/[deleted]", "text": "I feel like I’m just an option to this girl, but I’m unsure how to end things without drama. Advice?\n\nI’ve been seeing this girl I met in 2024, and at first, it seemed like we clicked. She seemed interested in me because of how I dress, but the more I got to know her, the more I started getting a gut feeling that something wasn’t right. Now, I’m wondering if I’m just being used as an option and don’t know how to let go.\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s been going on:\n\nHer situation: She works a minimum-wage retail job, and her parents are paying for her university. She’s even told me that she doesn’t want to study anymore, which is fine, but it’s the way she talks about it that’s making me uncomfortable.\n\nHer lifestyle talk: She’ll sometimes send me messages about girls with older, rich guys who pay for everything. It feels like she’s low-key pushing the idea that she’s after that kind of life, even though she doesn’t directly say it. I was shocked seeing reels that even encourage this sort of lifestyle. \n\nMy situation: I’m doing my MBA while working a side gig to pay for my expenses. I’m aiming for a corporate job and to move up in my career to live a comfortable life. I don’t mind being single long-term if it means I can focus on my future.\n\n\n\nBut here’s where things get weird:\n\nInconsistent behavior: She’ll reply to my messages after like 5-6 days, and we’ve tried making plans to meet up multiple times, but it’s never followed through. We did meet in real life at an event, it's just that we were planning to meet outside that event we both go to.\n\nReels and mixed signals: She sends me reels about how “nobody cares about your character, just your money,” and about how important money is to others. She doesn’t say it directly, but it feels like she’s sending me these to let me know she’s not looking for anything serious unless it comes with a lot of cash.\n\nThe feeling of being an option: There have been times when I’ve just stopped replying to her, and she’ll reach out again, either calling or texting. It honestly feels like I’m being kept as a backup plan, and it’s frustrating. I even created a GPT session where I gave it rules to write replies to her messages, as I felt I don't want that stress.\n\nFrom the beginning this girl said she doesn't want to marry or date but she would say and do things that stated otherwise which kept my hopes up. But I still find myself conflicted about whether I should just cut ties completely or keep things casual as “friends” with no hard feelings. Honestly, I think I’m over it, but I don’t want to cause drama or feel guilty afterward.\n\nI’ve been single for a while and I’ve started to accept that maybe I’ll just be the “cool uncle” type, work on my career, earn a decent income, and live comfortably without anyone else. I’m starting to think all this stress over her isn’t worth it, but I’m struggling with how to let go without any unnecessary drama or guilt.\n\nHow do I move on from this situation without feeling like I’ve wasted my time or burned a bridge? How do I cut things off in a way that doesn’t make things awkward? Would any girl accept me as I am in life, like a guy in a mid-level role? Or do they expect me to earn more and more like some kind of shareholder? Are all girls like this?

On the other hand, he sees that I don't communicate enough, and when I do, I talk a lot about running and exercise in general, and my work which is also in the field of sport, and gets annoyed to the point he wants me to talk about these stuff a lot less and try to be creative and come up with other topics.

{"id": "u/anotherhappylurker_1484", "user": "u/anotherhappylurker", "text": "Feeling guilty about making her unfollow her ex. Was I being unreasonable?\n\nSo this morning, I (28M) was casually discussing dating red flags with a new girl I'm seeing (26F). We've only been dating for a couple of months, so we were talking about boundaries and what we look for in a partner. I mentioned that I think it's a red flag if a girl is still in contact with her ex, because it means that she hasn't moved on, and is leaving the door open for future reconciliation. Therefore, I would be concerned about committing to a girl who still has ties to her ex, as I don't want to deal with the possibility that she still has feelings for him, or that her ex would try to sabotage the new relationship somehow. After hearing this, she ended up admitting to me that she still follows her ex even though they broke up a few years ago. She said that she's fully over him, but she didn't unfollow him because he rarely posts, and she didn't want him to think that she was trying to get his attention by unfollowing.\n\nWe ended up having a pretty long discussion about this topic, and I explained to her in a lot of detail why I felt like it was unhealthy to still follow an ex, and that it would be disrespectful to her new partner even if she didn't have any lingering feelings. I told her that I cut off all my exes after we break up, and therefore I'd hold my partner to the same standard. She said that she understood my perspective, and then promptly unfollowed her ex as a result (I don't know his username but I saw her following count go down). She wasn't mad or anything, she just said her ex didn't matter to her, and she didn't want this to be an issue in the future, so she decided to remove him on socials.\n\nAfter she unfollowed him, for some reason I felt a bit guilty that I had pressured her into doing that. I guess I didn't expect her to just comply without any argument, and I also don't want to come off as insecure or jealous. We're exclusively dating, but since we aren't technically official yet, I don't have any right to tell her to unfollow someone. I don't want to be seen as a controlling boyfriend in the future, and I'm worried that I crossed a line, even if she had no problem unfollowing him after I told her that it made me uncomfortable. Was I being reasonable, or will she possibly resent me in the future for having such strict boundaries about this?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

{"id": "u/monieo_1487", "user": "u/monieo", "text": "After a 12 year relationship, I've never had so many ups and downs from dating in my life. I feel lost.\n\nFor some context (this will take a bit of space, apologies), my ex and I (F29) were together for 12 years - we grew up together from 16/17 to 29/30. We travelled all over the world, we moved in together, we raised my dog. I thought this was going to be my life.\n\nWe decided to open our relationship about 7 years in, we were inexperienced in dating and wanted to have some fun. I was his first, and he was my second intimate relationship. I wanted him to experience everything the world could offer. We talked a lot about how shitting dating was for the both of us, how strange some people were, to bad dates to just borderline bonker stories we'd had. We were content. We were still intimate; we had each other to fall back on.\n\nThen it moved to a poly relationship a few years later- I was more hesitant about this; as much as I enjoyed going on dates and meeting new people I only really wanted one primary partner. I feel like we were being intimate less, acting more like housemates than partners. We were arguing more. He got another girlfriend, It wasn't working out for me despite my efforts in dating.\n\nWe eventually hit a peak where he told me it wasn't working out. I was devastated but I felt like I could see this coming, we probably should have broken up 5 years ago when we started experimenting with relationship types. I felt like I had been grieving this relationship for many many years but persisted because it was the only safety I knew. We are still friends, and I do still love him (just not in a relationship way).\n\nHe moved out, I had to figure out what life was like on my own, with my dog. Being on my own felt freeing but also incredibly isolating. I had no one to fall back on anymore, just myself. I promised my friend I'd stay single for a year minimum. I'm wanting to keep to that.\n\nI started dating, I met a LOT of people. Some good, some bad, some downright abusive and manipulative. I started figuring out what I like and what I don't like.\n\nThe first guy I started seeing after my break up broke me more than my 12 year relationship. Things were going well, I thought he liked me, he was calling me pet names (red flag I know, after only 3 weeks of knowing each other) and seemed genuine in wanting to help me buy new furniture and help me move on from my ex. Then out of the blue things changed and he pulled back excessively till he just stopped talking to me. I spiralled, I was so confused. Why didn't he like me any more? What had I done wrong? I was inconsolable to my friends. I eventually got over it, but only with other people.\n\nThis was a rinse and repeat with many other people, I'd get so emotionally attached because I just wanted comfort and be surprised when they'd pack up or imply that they didn't like me any more. I just wanted consistency. I just wanted someone to like me, for me.\n\nI've been rejected more times this year than I've ever had in my life. It stings a little bit less every time but it still lingers. I've had so many great dates, so many highs of feeling like I've connected genuinely to someone only for them to just leave me in the lurch.\n\nThe worst experience I ever had was someone who I genuinely thought was lovely, they gave me gifts - they took time to see me (several times a week - up to 3-4 times which again is a red flag), they complimented me and took me on really nice dates. They were also unfortunately very emotionally unstable and I had to manage their excessive mood swings like crazy and it got to a head where I had invited them to a wedding (red flag on my end ;\\_\\_;) and they confessed that they loved me after only knowing me for 3 months. I felt trapped, I was very drunk and I knew I had to say it back or I'd have to manage their mood swings at my cousins wedding. Eventually I had enough and they unironically cut it off with me first via text and I just never replied. Dusted my hands of it and wanted to move on.\n\nAnd then after a few weeks of no contact they started bombarding me with the most insanely nasty messages, telling me I was an awful person, calling me excessively late at night and threatening to come to my house to confront me for \"ghosting\" them (when he had literally told me it wasn't working out over text). I was terrified this man could kill me, I locked down my entire house, brought my dog inside and had a frying pan next to my bed just in case. It was probably one of the scariest moments of my life. I feel like I've developed trauma from this and I'm STILL dealing with it.\n\nI go on dates with people and I am starting to be scared of the outcomes specifically post first/second date, what if they don't like me? What if I said or did something wrong? I went on a date last week that I thought was so genuine. We flirted all night, he seemed very interested in me, we talked about a lot of different topics and it felt... wholesome. It felt good. The next day nothing. I haven't heard a peep even after letting them know how nice the date was and that we should go on a date again. They're still watching my stories but haven't opened my message and it kind of broke me a little.\n\nI had a breakdown to my friend asking why no one has been consistent, or why these people seem so genuine but don't seem interested back. Or at least, not in that way. Am I not worthy of love? I am my sincere self in ALL things. I don't believe I should \"hide\" any part of myself to someone for their benefit. I wear my heart on my sleeve. Does this repulse people? It is exhausting. I feel bankrupt.\n\nI tie myself up in people and It's really hard to let go. I fantasize about them even before I even get to know them. That is something I am trying to work on but when i'm trapped inside my brain I feel so stuck. My friends say I am worthy of love, that I am funny and charming and genuine. I see how my friends love their partners and I can't help but feel a tinge of jealousy. I feel like my relationship with my ex wasn't filled with romance the way I really wanted it to. I made cards, I gave gifts, I gave everything. He wasn't really into that stuff and I just felt a bit defeated by it.\n\nI am trying to work on myself first and foremost, my best friend has said I've achieved so much this year living on my own for the first time, being independent, forging my own path without having to put others first. But it's hard. I genuinely do want to find someone who will like me for me. And I don't know where I am going. Dating feels like sorting through the shit and still getting shit when i think I've found a genuine person. They're all the same.\n\nI still want to date, It's given me more self confidence about myself than I've ever had, that maybe I am attractive and nice and caring and people see that. The highs and lows are just incredibly crippling and I feel lost.\n\nTL;DR - Dated for 12 years, was in an open/poly relationship, didn't work out. My ex moved out, has a girlfriend and I'm struggling to find someone consistent to hang with, have fun and have a genuine connection. Feel like I'll never find someone genuine.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I don’t report directly to him, he is 4 levels above me.  I’ve been working with him for 2 years on the same project. In the beginning, it was just a really solid work bond — we clicked over the same hobbies, same personality, inside jokes, shared struggles. We even spent a Saturday morning together doing our hobby (my boyfriend at the time was there too). Nothing weird, just… natural.\n\nBut things shifted at last year’s Christmas party.

In August we met for drinks and a week later we met for brunch. We had great momentum after our second date. However, after that, it was hard to coordinate a time to plan a date next as I was out of down Labor Day weekend and he was out of town the last few weekends on trips with friends, so brunch was technically our last date.

{"id": "u/Storydazzling2628_1504", "user": "u/Storydazzling2628", "text": "When you make a joke that unintentionally offends someone\n\nHi everyone, I need some outside perspective. My boyfriend (30M) is from Peru and I (31F) am from Brazil. We’re in a long-distance relationship, but we spend a lot of time together online, playing games, and in long videocalls talking and spending good time together. Usually, we joke around a lot—it’s part of our dynamic and normally it’s lighthearted and fun.\n\nThe situation: today we were playing an online game with his little sister. We often tease each other and he tease his sister a lottttt, and he himself constantly calls us things like, “You’re so bad, you can’t play at all, I have to do everything.” It doesn’t bother me. it's true that sometimes I play well and sometimes I don’t, and I just laugh it off.\n\nThis time, though, I said, “Don’t worry, I’m going to carry the game,” but he misheard it as, “What? You’re going to ruin the game?” (in Spanish *cargar* = to carry, and *cagar* = to mess up). I usually laugh these things off, but I was a little annoyed because he had already been making comment after comment. Still, it wasn’t a big deal, it’s just a game. I corrected the word he used and called him “idiot,” but I said it in a joking tone.\n\nHe got really upset, stopped smiling, and after his sister left the room, he told me, “I don’t mind harsh jokes, but I didn’t expect that from you. To me, your tone wasn’t playful—it sounded like something that slipped out.” I was confused and said, “Why would I call you ‘idiot’ seriously and not as a joke?” He explained that sometimes when people are angry, they say things they don’t mean even to the parents and then regret it later.\n\nHere’s the part that’s hard for me: to me, when something “slips out,” it usually means it’s what you *really* think of the person, which wasn’t the case at all. But now he’s saying he feels like I’m not being honest with him, that maybe I hide things or lie. He even asked me if I’ve ever lied to him about anything—which I haven’t. I’ve always been completely transparent with him in every way, no matter how embarrassing or intimate.\n\nThe thing is, he’s very insecure because of his past relationships—he’s been cheated on before on relationships in his city, and that left him distrustful. I try my best every day to show him I’m not like that, that he can trust me. But this situation makes me worried: how can I reassure him and clear up this misunderstanding without making him feel dismissed?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He has a differing opinion. He believes it is pointless since we don't talk. However, he doesn't feel this way every night. It confuses me. Normally he will bring up calling me at night, and he is normally the one who calls me to fall asleep. We've fallen asleep together on the phone pretty consistently. I am just not sure how I should handle this. I do not understand why he randomly just does not want to call. When it does happen, it hurts my feelings because again, i love having his presence. However, I feel childish for this. How should I handle this? Should I let it go and deal with not calling at night even though it hurts my feelings? He is right, it is somewhat pointless because we don't talk. I don't want to end up suffocating him. We are 6 hours apart. To clarify as well, we have our own separate hobbies and time away while not being on our phones talking. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I’m so sorry for this long post but I would really appreciate someone’s advice on my case. 😭 Please hear me out.\n\nI’m 29 and have been together with my boyfriend (28) for almost 15 years. We’ve known each other for a long time but I’m starting to doubt his feelings. I feel like I’ve been waiting for too long and he’s not really thinking about our future together. He’s unemployed and I’m working overseas. We’ve been LDR for 3 years and plan to see each other by the end of this year. My friends are saying that he might propose this time but I know he’s not ready for marriage yet. I do want him to be my husband in the future but he’s not the “partner” that I need in life as of the moment. I’m hoping he’ll still change but time is running out - I am diagnosed with severe PCOS and my OB advised me to have children soon before 35 or else I should give up on having kids.\n\nI do love him but this LDR thing is driving me nuts. In the back of my mind, I would rather die single than keep being on this situation. My love language is physical touch and him is words of affirmation. Imagine how hard it is for me being so far away and not feel his “love”. I was even diagnosed with major depression because of this. 😔\n\nI kept on telling him my feelings and what I want him to do but I also don’t want to be a “nagger”. I feel so bad because he’s trying. He has a lot of potential but I don’t really know what to do anymore to motivate and support him. He said that I should just be there for him but is it really enough? I honestly think he’ll be the best version of himself without me in his life. (I stayed for 15 years and nothing happened. Maybe the problem is me, right? 😭) I can’t help but think that I might NOT be the one  that he needs on his side. 🥹😭\n\nSo here’s my question: Should I end things with him after our trip (at least I’ll be able to say my feelings personally) or just do it online prior and just cancel our plans? If you were on my shoes, how will you break up with someone who’s been with you half of your life? Both ways will definitely hurt but which do you think is more considerate?\n\nHe’s very faithful and loyal. We’re always in video chat even when sleeping so 100% no 3rd parties involve. We rarely fight only have 3 major misunderstandings! He’s my soulmate and I love him so much. I truly believe I won’t be able to fall in love again after this. 😔", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I'm in my final year of university and just mentioned to him that I'm starting to look at companies to apply for near him to hopefully be able to have a job lined up by the time I graduate this spring. Now he's talking about maybe having second thoughts on the whole thins since he's worried thing might not work out between us since he's not sure about how our dynamic will feel when we're in person long-term together.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship he was able to move to campus much closer to me for his schooling (only a five hour drive!!), so we were able to visit each other much more frequently. I'd spend most of my week-long school breaks with him and we'd try to spend every other weekend together, and it was the happiest I've ever been.\n\nOnce he graduated he had to move further away again to do a specialty program and lost a lot of his free time, so it was a drastic change for us only being able to call and talk to each other for thirty mins a day. I was only able to come visit him for two weekends the entire six months his program lasted for with how strict their commitment was. It was really difficult for him to keep the 'spark' we had alive due to not being able to talk or text at all for so long. He said it felt like he didn't even have a girlfriend at that point. But when we're able to see each other again things always get so much better.\n\nHe's had to move to the opposite coast fall of last year, and with the three hour time difference between us, it's still difficult to be able to talk as much as we used to in the beginning, but we're able to have nightly calls pretty much everyday and lil gaming sessions on the weekends. With my school schedule, I'm able to go visit about a week every two months, but our situation is still pretty difficult for him with the lack of quality time and physical touch.\n\nHe still has some doubts and doesn't feel '100%' since we've been doing long-distance for so long it's difficult to maintain a connection with all the highs and lows. Things are still so amazing when we're together, it just hurts so much in time in between them feeling like things are fading. He used to be more sure that once we closed the gap things would get a lot better, but now he's starting to have doubts. I feel like they're similar to the ones I have about uprooting my life and moving to another country, but I feel like the risk is worth it for a chance at us.\n\nFor both of us, this is our first long-term relationship, so I'm not sure if these are just normal feelings when it comes to moving on to a next step, or if its actually a sign of incompatibility or the relationship actually crumbling. I love him so much and really want to make things work out with him, but I'm worried I'll put all this effort in to finally moving over to him just for him not to want anything with me anymore.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TIMEZONE_MISMATCH"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Personally I feel if you are dealing with someone who has cheated in the past then trust your gut. In my case with my LTR of a year and a half, she turned out to be a bit of a serial cheater, both physical and emotional.  My gut always told me something was off despite the denials and pledges of love, future marriage etc. She had cheated before and the signs were always there again. I stuck around because she was going through an unrelated difficult personal situation and I wanted to support her. The red flags were always there. Not wanting to see me too often, phone blowing up from “friends” while I was there, going through the motions in the bedroom or not interested at all, working late or bed early etc.  Then she started changing her hair, losing weight, using new phrases during text etc., the usual signs. It was about a week after one visit the I had to see a doctor for a plumbing issue. Proof positive of cheating. Thank goodness it was treatable and the battery of additional tests came back negative. When I addressed this it was met with DARVO. (She has textbook covert narcissist traits, which might help explain all this) Due to her “gift” I felt compelled to dig deeper in my suspicions.  I did the usual on the people finder search sites. Found some stuff. Additional phone numbers, email addresses, generic social media. I knew for a fact there was more. I’ve seen it. I enlisted a professional service. Actually a friend of mine who does that for a living. He told me flatly that anything you send online or electronically stays out there and can be found not matter what any app says, if you delete it, the dm, message, pic or video disappears or can’t be screened shot. So consider that when communicating.  He found much more than I was prepared for. Messages, pics., videos, profiles, etc.  I was shocked and saddened. Not the vindication I wanted but what I suspected. I even used one of the user names from a site to locate a comment where she shared her recent Tinder experience. It was a week after our last visit. I’m not shaming, blaming, exposing or calling out. Just sharing my experience. Sorry for the long story and letting me vent.  I got off track. At the end of the day the blame for my situation is on my shoulders. I knew her history and saw all the subtle and obvious signs. Not angry and no animosity. I’m an fool but if I can help anyone avoid the same mistakes I made, then it is worth being an idiot. I guess what I’m trying to say is, Once a Cheater Always a Cheater?

{"id": "u/throwawaycookie9_1519", "user": "u/throwawaycookie9", "text": "26(F), had a big argument with 36(M) last night now he said he’s giving me space\n\nWe’ve been talking every day for 9 months now - no labels. I’m pretty much stuck in a situationship. He told me about 6 months ago that if we were to be together it would take maybe 1-2 years because he was unsure of where he’s at in his life or what to do with it. He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me. So I’m genuinely confused by all of this. \n\nNow he’s apologised and said he’s giving me time and space to figure out what I want and where I want to go from here which has really confused me because I’ve always been open about how I feel about him and that I wanted to meet him in person and see if we could start a relationship which is something at the start of us talking, he was open to but now he’s completely against it. He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. \n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute he acts as if we are in a committed relationship i.e we made an agreement not to do anything sexual or even touch ourselves unless we were both doing it, things like that which hint to being in a relationship then I ask him what we are or talk about my feelings and he shuts it down. \n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me.

I don't know what to do [23F and 23F]\n\nMy LD partner of \\~8 months (1.5 years if you count the weird-homoerotic-situationship-friendship stage, yes seriously) confessed to me a couple of days ago that she had 'sexted' someone else once 5 months ago before telling them she can't ever do it again. This is a person I have been suspicious of before- when I've asked my partner before if this person had been flirty with her, she said \"I don't think so, no\" which I now know was a lie. This person also knows that we are in a relationship, or just generally that my partner is taken. I know the two of them were on a trip together about 2 months ago with other people present on the trip, (I know for certain because I know other people who went) which I knew about and my partner asked me for permission to go on because she knew I had suspicions about this person. My partner maintains that nothing happened on this trip, and nothing happened after the one incident as the other person was respectful of her telling her she didn't want to do anything like that. Me and my partner both don't really like this person for reasons of a whole other Lesbian Drama nature so I'm inclined to believe her.\n\nI'm really upset about this, but I of course wanted to look more into it. My partner provided me with the screenshots and has been very forthcoming about any and all questions I've had and requests for evidence. It really doesn't seem like 'sexting' rather just this person being very forward and sexual with my partner on one occasion and then my partner just giving bland/deflecting responses before telling her a couple days later that she can't do anything like that. She confirmed to me that thats how she felt in the moment, like she just wanted to deflect it (we both have anxiety so while I'm mad she didn't straight up tell her no, I get it in a way). So my main bit of upset is the fact that she waited to tell me for 5 months, because it's not 'as bad' as I thought. She said that she was just really scared about how I would handle the information which makes sense but I stressed to her that stuff like this just gains more weight the longer you go without being honest.\n\nI don't really know what to do or how to proceed- I've never been cheated on before, and I don't even know that I would consider it cheating, just lying. I also don't have a lot of relationship experience to begin with. I really do love this girl, and my heart is telling me not to break up with her. We've been basically finalizing her next visit these past couple of weeks, too, so my heart is really excited (dedicated? I guess?) to the idea of her coming. But I'm a little depressed right now so it's hard to know how to proceed or if it would be right to proceed. I feel like everyone would look down on me or think I was stupid if I did, or like the universe is somehow telling me to break it off. But you know how depression is- it just tries to convince you to burn everything down and run away. So I don't know if my feelings are just because of that or if there's more validity to them. After all, a LDR is serious. If we continue to date and it gets more serious to the point of moving, it would mean so much effort and change for me.\n\nAny advice is appreciated but please be gentle.

We are both in our 20’s now but we also met online through Xbox. We’re on different sides of the country though but we somehow always come back to each other. We’ve dated on and off for years now, always something pulling us back together. \n\nBut back in 2023 we finally met in person and it was the greatest experience I’ve ever had with someone. I felt as if there were constant fireworks blowing up inside me with every little interaction, look, touch, talk, etc. right before we met I was wishing and hoping that we would end up together again, but I would take it seriously this time. Hell I was even considering just not flying back home and leaving everything back at home just to stay with her. \n\nAnyways, we go and do all the fun activities and go on amazing dates and she finally tells me that’s she’s always been in love with me, then it’s all just sparks going through my body and heart starts racing, butterflies in the stomach, everything. I truly believed she was my soulmate, I still do. The thing is, I started noticing she was one her phone a lot. I let my weakness get to me and I peaked at her phone and come to find out she was still texting her ex. But I didn’t care about it in the moment, I knew she was mine. She introduced me to her parents and brother and her elderly cat. Her dad seemed to really like me cause he offered me a drink and was really interested in what I wanted in life, same with her brother. \n\nIt also got to the point where I would cry by just admiring her. I’ve never done that with anyone in my life, i barely let my vulnerabilities show with anyone but I knew with her I could truly be myself. I truly loved her. \n\nBut after coming back home I couldn’t get the thought of her talking to her ex while I was away since he lived so much closer than I did. So my obsession and jealousy had a grip on me and I know that’s what ruined things. I could tell it was upsetting her when I would bring it up but I was so stuck with that thought of losing her, I didn’t see myself being the reason she leaves. \n\nI go on a trip to Colorado with a few of my friends and I’m getting less and less contact from her and finally towards the end of my trip she ends things with me. It absolutely devastated me. Eyes were so swollen and red and stomach constantly yelling at me just because I would not eat. I remember passing out on the floor a couple of times from breaking down. \n\nWell I gave it 6 months till I tried talking to someone else again but I never got that same feeling that I did with her. So it really drove me away from those people. I constantly tried to compare them to her. I still kept contacts with her of course and I don’t think that was helping. I only wanted her back. So I stopped looking for someone else and didn’t date for a year and a half, I was so love sick I started convincing myself that if I better myself, she would come back to me. (God I sound so corny) but after talking to someone for a bit, we start dating and I tell her. \n\nFor more context, I wasn’t the best person in my youth and so I ghosted her a few times due to stress or jealousy or to just move on. So I completely understand her reasoning. She then blocks me on everything. I felt my heart drop and everything in my life go grey. I immediately broke things off with the person I was talking to, because they weren’t her and I didn’t want to put that on her. I could tell I didn’t have any interest in them or wanting to make any progress to. I’m still madly in love with her and I don’t think I’ll ever get over her.

I send her gifts, take pictures of flowers once in a while and everything she wanted me to do. It made me happy too seeing her happy.\n\nOne month ago, she suddenly stopped texting me. Everything was going fine, I was looking for an apartment closer to my office so we get more time together. She just told to leave her alone and hasn't been checking, replying to my messages for over a month now. I thought something happened to her and tried to find out. I managed to find her Pinterest where she's very active and keeps saving posts everyday. It kinda broke me. We both used to text a lot everyday and she is very good at ignoring me.\n\nWe remember talking about our future plans, made list of things we would do once we meet, set time capsules with letters to read once we get together. And now, everything has come to a standstill. She hasn't talked to me yet, didn't tell anything about breakup too. I just don't know what to do. It's so difficult waiting.

My boyfriend of 6 years and I bought a house together 3 years ago. We have definitely hit some rocky bumps along the way, especially during the 3 years we lived together, but for the most part I thought we were happy. We have talked about marriage, but he’s not ready to commit. \n\nI was accepted into a school program but the closest one was 2 hours away in person. It’s a 4 year program. Before we even started dating I made it clear that this is what I wanted to do with my life, and he was supportive. When I was even accepted, his family really discouraged him from leaving and even told me I was selfish to ask him to come with me. I discussed how this made me feel with him, and he assured me he would move down with me within a year (our house is currently under renovation that needs to be completed). I moved roughly 2 months ago and it’s been tough transitioning from seeing him every day to only seeing him once a week (props to those who go months). Two weeks ago when he visited me he was excited to move down (or so I thought). This weekend I went to visit him and he drops this bombshell on me that he actually doesn’t want to move from his friends, family, and job. \n\nI am having a really hard time processing this information. Obviously I want him to be happy, and don’t want to pull him away from everything, but this is what I worried about right after being accepting. It’s literally my worst nightmare come true. Seeing him once a week isn’t working especially because his family keeps having events the day he’s supposed to come down so then it’s sometimes 2-3 weeks in between and the times he doesn’t go to family things to see me his family makes him feel guilty for missing it. \n\nI just don’t know what to do if there even is anything I can do.

For example, she once accused me of not taking “my” post when it was actually hers, and another time claimed the sink wasn’t accessible because I left an empty noodle packet on the side while I was still cooking.\n\nThis week, she accused me of leaving the freezer open. I pushed back and explained that the top drawers are mine (mostly empty), but the bottom drawers are hers and packed full, and that the landlord actually told me the freezer should’ve been defrosted before I moved in. I also pointed out other issues like pubes in the bathroom and bad smells in the kitchen.\n\nI mirrored her style and said, “Please ensure the flat’s cleanliness and hygiene are in line with the landlord’s rules so that it remains accessible for both of us to use.” She got visibly shocked and told me, “I can’t believe you’re trying to tell me what to do. I’ve been telling you what to do since you moved in, why are you breaking the dynamic?” Then she started shouting and ranting at me in the kitchen. I waited until she finished and said “we’ll talk once you’ve calmed down, any other issue speak to your landlord” with a straight face and monotone and went to my room. She started smashing something in the sink and kept shouting for an hour. \n\nAt this point, I feel like she’s targeting me, and now that I’ve pushed back she’s escalating.

I 20f was with my ex 21m for 4 years. We had our future planned out together, we would get engaged when he was back from deployment, I would get my bachelors degree in nursing.\n\nHowever, things changed towards the end of our relationship which I would say was March of 2025. We were constantly arguing, he was becoming increasingly possessive to the point where it was making me greatly doubt me staying. He was deployed throughout all of this and I understand he was stressed, which is why I gave him the option that we separate for a little bit just to give each other that space and so we can work on ourselves. He had agreed, yet kept overstepping my boundary and when I told him not to do that, he would start getting angry with me.\n\nI eventually had enough and decided to end it with him in mid May.

I have pleaded with him for the last 6 years to seek treatment. He won’t do it. I’ve asked him why, many times over the years, but the reason is never the same. I don’t think he’s convinced that a therapist will help him. Last year, he was fired from his job because he was burnt out and not fulfilling all his responsibilities. They offered to help him, but he refused. For all of this year, he hasn’t done anything to help himself.

But I am seriously debating leaving him - I am fed up.\n\nWe have been long-distance for about 3 years, and he's now going to continue on his course for another 3 years. We barely talk and see each other, and I seem to be the one making all the effort. I have a decent job and I don't want to leave it, I recently re-located for this job (we used to see each other if we were in our home towns at the same time) but recently he's refused to stay mine when I am down, I understand that its not great sleeping on a blow-up bed, but his house stinks and is disgustingly filthy (I wont shower there bc I fell dirtier after a shower there) - yet he'd still rather stay there, which means I don't see my family for as long or my pets when I come and visit bc I am staying at his.\n\nWe had a falling out on our 4-year anniversary, bc I took time off work to go up and see him, he told me just before I was going to leave to not take my holiday days as he was too busy with coursework. So I went up just on the weekend instead. I asked him to book dinner and to plan a day, and to pay, as I had brought him gifts and he didn't get me anything. On our anniversary, he lay in bed saying he didn't feel well, so we didn't do anything for our anniversary, and it felt like I had wasted a lot of money as he just spent our time in bed, and when he did go and do his coursework, it consisted of scrolling through what seemed to be Instagram reels and discord then maybe some work. To top it off, his roommate offered to make me food, I refused and waited for my bf to come downstairs, which then I was offered a truce of a dominoes pizza, which I couldn't keep down as I had been waiting for him all day and hadnt eaten anything other than apples in the fridge which he told me were rotten after I had eaten them.\n\nWe've had arguments over him not speaking to me as well, he has acknowledged that a message from him is all that I want and its just a way that I know he knows I'm still here ya know, we used to call in the evenings but he doesn't like it as we have different sleeping patterns and he didn't like it and being stuck on call with me as I slept. And I used to get annoyed if he hung up. But I have stopped that now. i also went through a massive issue of idk where he was and what he was doing till he was out doing it - which is what mainly ruined the call time, which was very important to me at the time, as it eats the only time I got to hear his voice and hear about his day if it consisted more of \"not much\" which I regret now but I did use to stalk him a bit just to see what he was doing, bc he wouldn't tell me.\n\nonto our most recent, idk what to call it. I message him every morning, if I forget, I may send a message in the evening (and if I have missed a day like i slept through a weekend before I apologised and told him why I didn't message him) my message consists of saying 'good morning babe' And I typically get a message at 1 pm saying 'hey' - he had not messaged me for a whole day even though his Instagram said he had been online through multiple intervals during the day, he then messaged me the next day saying 'hey' no sorry or explanation. so I have been letting him initiate the conversation - I want to make it clear that I haven't been ignoring him, just letting him message me first. he than asked me if I was okay and he hadn't heard from me, which I then told him I was fuming over the fact he didn't message me and I needed a few days to think, he has now said that 'so the best option was to make the situation worse and not talk to me about it?' which he does have a point. But I am completely fed up. i will also add that he is ignoring all of my messages, as he has read a few of them and has hung up on me, trying to call him twice.\n\nI don't understand why he can 'take time to think' but I can't?\n\nIt also feels like I am the only one who cares, puts effort and cries over the relationship, while he goes unbothered.\n\nHe has been fixing my PC (it is fixed now), and I plan on going home, picking it up, telling him I'm done, as he starts his course again, and I think this would be the best time for both of us to start fresh. He can find a new girl who can deal with not being spoken to, and I can find someone who wants to talk to me. Then spend the rest of my weekend with my family.\n\nAm I over reacting?

The first is hygiene. His place is immaculate. He definitely showers daily and brushes his teeth, but I need a little more hygiene before hookup. If we just ate pizza, making out with you is gonna turn my stomach. Also, his nether region picks up a lot of scent throughout the day, even if he showered that morning. I love going down there, but my gag reflex is directly related to smells, so between the food kissing and the junk, I just physically can’t do it. I fully acknowledge this might be a me problem, but I also think he probably wants BJs, so how do I communicate that? The other issue is that he 100% has sleep apnea. Like 45 seconds of no breathing, absolute stillness, followed by a sharp gasp and full body twitch. As you can imagine, that is impossible to sleep next to (even with ear plugs). I moved to the couch at about 3am and blamed the cold temperature, but the truth is I simply couldn’t fall asleep because once a minute I was getting jerked by his coming back to life.

He also won’t kiss me anymore besides pecks. I try to kiss him longer and he pulls away. He has stopped giving me oral also but always wants me to give it to him.\n\nI just don’t understand what he wants out of this because it’s not like we have amazing sex all the time and he’s just spending his money on buying my food when we go out to eat.\n\nI still feel in love with him which is why I haven’t cut things off. He makes a lot of empty promises that make me feel like things will change. Like he just got a new apartment of his own and says now that he’s done that then he will make more effort but low and behold he has another thing he now must do before he can put the work in. It just never ends.\n\nYesterday he called me after being gone a week and said I can come over “if I want to” and I just lost it I’m like how can you not care to see me, this hurts because I miss you and I’ve been so anxious about our relationship and blah blah so I asked him again one more time to do the things I need him to do or I’m done and I think he knows I was serious this time because he wouldn’t say yes and just kept reverting to how I should be understanding  of everything going on with his life as a busy young man and I just said I do understand but you also need to understand where I’m coming from. So basically I think we are gonna break up because I said I’m not gonna wait around for his effort anymore. And it’s not like I’m leaving anything anyways. But I don’t want to. I really want to stay together but the pain this is causing me is unbearable now.\n\nSo did I make the right decision? Or does anyone have any suggestions to help us work through this? Although it feels unlikely.\n\nTL;DR: Been with my bf (26M) for almost 2 years. He works away half the year and puts little effort into calls, dates, or intimacy when he’s home. I’ve asked for more quality time and affection, but he makes empty promises and never follows through. Our sex life has suffered, and I feel neglected and unloved. I told him I’m done unless he steps up, but he keeps saying I should just “understand he’s busy.” I love him, but the relationship is painful and feels one-sided. Did I make the right call ending it, or is there a way to fix this?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I want to say about 3 months into the school year, we met and were inseparable. I dropped out of college after the first semester, and he completed one full year and ultimately dropped out as well. He’s from the West Coast and I am from the South (where we attended college). Upon us dropping out, we made the decision to stay a couple as he moved back home to the West Coast and I stayed in my hometown. We maintained a LDR for months without seeing each other during those times.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2023 I visited for a week and a month later, I decided to move thousands of miles away from everything I know (family, friends, etc.), to California for us to live together. I luckily had a job lined up for when I officially moved and my BF worked as well. \n\nEverything was great in the beginning, we both worked, were able to buy our dream cars, and maintain our new home. But there was no romance in my opinion. No dates, no random spontaneous surprises, nothing. Just seeing each other everyday as if we are roommates. Now…don’t get me wrong, he never fails to be affectionate and say he loves me, but I didn’t feel as if that was enough. \n\nJumping to the Spring of 2024, he started having financials issues. He could no longer afford his car, and was running behind on his half of bills. We try to split bills 50/50, and I was having to pick up the slack on rent and other bills. He decided to get rid of his car so that eliminated the car note and insurance (saving him $1400 a month) , but he still was behind. So for months, I was paying more than my normal half of the bills. Which I was okay with at the time. I took it as a bump in the road, and he would get back on his feet. But things remained the same.\n\nMoving on the Winter of 2024, I started working a bit less because I was getting burnt out. Working 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week was overwhelming for me. My BF ended up switching jobs in hopes for better pay and less hours, but it did not work out that way. He was working less hours with less pay. At this point, i’m still helping him with his bills and now i’m slowly falling behind on my own. I would hold off on paying certain things that I knew didn’t need to be paid immediately, just so we wouldn’t be late on rent or necessary utilities. This lasted until the spring of 2025.\n\n Now we arrive to the most recent time, Summer of 2025. At the beginning of the summer, he decided to quit his job to pursue trucking and get his CDL. He quit before having anything set in stone, and so it has been about 2 months of him having no job or being in trucking school.\nI have been left on my own to pay the bills, granted he does have a monthly check of $700 coming in but it barely puts a dent in our bills. He has been looking for work and has had interviews, but nothing yet. \n\nAt this point, We are behind on rent, and I am far behind on my car note and I also can’t drive my car because there is major work that needs to be done but I couldn’t afford it because all of my money was going to help him. He was able to purchase another car earlier this year that we now use as our daily driver, but of course he is behind on payments due to the circumstances. \n\nNow aside from all of that, we just celebrated our 3 year anniversary and throughout these 3 years I feel like ive been very repetitive about things that make me feel a way in our relationship. \n\n1. No Dates. Even in the beginning when we had no money issues, he would blame it on not having the money to do so. I am a pretty simple girl, it doesn’t take much to make me happy. I told him, he didn’t have to spend loads of money, even if he just planned a picnic or at home dinner date I would be ecstatic. \n\n2. I felt like he prioritized the money he did/does have for other things . Smoking, gaming, etc. \n\n3. He always says he doesn’t know how to be romantic, and i told him in this  day and age the internet is very helpful. Still nothing. Never plans anything. But can plan time with his friends…now he doesn’t go out with them often, barely at all but he puts more effort when he is planning with them. \n\n4. Before we started having financial issues, I could slowly see we were heading in that direction. I suggested to him that we should get second jobs. He was not a fan of the idea. I repeated this constantly, til the point where I was going to just get one myself but I felt like why should I have to work extra while he acts like he doesn’t have to. This leads to…\n\n5. He isn’t receptive to my suggestions. I suggested and extra job, I suggested he should have stayed at his last job until he was solidified in school, etc. But NO, he never took my advice. But whenever his mom tells him these things AFTER I have already said something he acts like its an idea he’s never heard of. I love his mom, but I just don’t appreciate the fact that it only clicks when she says something and not when I bring it up. \n\n6. He doesn’t like to help cook. He barely cleans and when he does it’s always after ive asked millions of times and he won’t do it by himself. He would wait til I got upset and started doing it myself, to start. \n\n7. While this isn’t necessarily his fault, I am extremely homesick. His family is not as big and close as mine. They don’t do family gatherings like mine or even just having family houses to go to to spend time with. I am lonely, I haven’t met any friends here. He’s the only person I technically have here, and I barely feel like I have him. \n\nI say all this to say, I talked about all these points to him about a month ago. At that point, I was ready to throw in the towel but he promised to be better and help more which he slowly has. Although now that he is, I still don’t feel happy. I feel as if he waited until he knew I was completely over it to change. Now I just feel nothing, and I dont want to be  in the wrong and breakup. We’re clearly going through something that most young adults deal with in these circumstances, but idk. I dont know if I should wait around and see if things completely change or just be done with the relationship. I don’t want to ruin something that could be good or hurt his feelings because I know he feels bad about not being able to do what he needs to.\n___\n\n**TL;DR;** :  I feel like my relationship is only a priority to my boyfriend now because I was at the edge of leaving.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

His family consists of these: Grandmother (95), uncle (66m) deceased, his dad (66m) deceased and aunt (64f) dying and the sole “grandchild” my boyfriend. \n\nWe’ve been together for 3 years now, and experienced the worst of the worst. Uncle died years prior to us meeting from aortic rupture, then his dad died 1 year into our relationship due to the same cause. My bf had to financially take care of everything, dad’s mortgage, his loans, his debts, his funeral etc. because he is an only child which pushed us into legit debt we’re still paying off. Which means we live day to day (did live us a heavy mortgaged house atleast that). My bf then had to start taking care of his grandmother who lives alone but due to age can’t go to the store, doctors.. \n\nThe aunt used to live with the grandmother and did some work for us so we could stabilise our income and pay off debts (work overtime and what not). Last week the aunt suffered a heart stroke, barely survived. \n\nNow it’s all on us. The aunt lives alone, had no man and bore no children, then there is the grandmother, which needs constant daily support and attention. The aunt lost mobility and is mentally 5 years old as she suffered brain damage due to lack of oxygen. We have barely enough money to cover our expenses and pay off debts, now the grandmother and aunt will need 24 hour help. We can’t afford it, the state won’t help, neither will social services.\n\nWe are young, we didn’t even manage to have a kid yet because we need to give our lives away for the people who’ve already lived their lives through, nor do we have financial needs to have a child. Our whole relationship is nonexistent because we work our asses off just to give the money to the people we aren’t even in debt with because of inheritance. We can’t take it anymore. \n\nWe can’t live like this anymore, my bf is a mess, i am a mess, we can’t go on like this. No amount of support from eachother, sticking together, love and respect can save us from what we’re experiencing. My bf became heavily suicidal, and I am depressed like i’ve never been before. These people who are legit not even our worry, have become the vampires robbing us of our lives and our future together. They’re robbing us of having kids and we can’t do anything about it, because they’re still family. \n\nWhat should I do? How can I (and him) escape from this hell that’s become our lives? I need advice, I am at my end. I sure as hell won’t leave my boyfriend because of his extended family I just want to live my life with him. I want our life, i want us, and noone else. \n\nShould we move to another country? Because that’s the best solution we have so far. Sell everything and just run away because the negativity won’t seem to stop. Please… i need advice. We’re at our end. \n\nTL;DR: My bf is the only child of the family, everyone died, aunt is dying, grandmother needs help daily. We inherited all debt, and need to give our lives and money to them to keep them alive. We can’t do it anymore and need to run away. \n\nEDIT: included country - SLOVENIA, EUROPE.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

It was full of romance from start to finish. I have never felt so well taken care of, seen emotionally, satisfied physically & sexually, and just reassured in every aspect of my relationship before. Not only did he ask me to be his girlfriend, but he expressed that he loved me and that he was in love with me, and that he wants to build a future, is committed to me, and sees me as his future wife. I want all of these things with him, and I am committed to him as well.\n\nAlso, he’s not love bombing me. If he’s love bombing me then we’re love bombing each other. We’re both adults who have been through our fair-share of relationships, so please keep those comments to a minimum :). \n\nThat being said, we got into it on the last night we were together, twice, on 2 separate incidents. The first one, he got upset with me because i didn’t want what he offered, and for some reason, he took that personally. It was as simple as I was pouring myself some water from the limited fountain in the hotel lobby, and the water ran empty. I, was personally ok with my half-cup of water, however when i walked away, my partner motioned that i should come get some from his fountain and I mentioned that i was ok. He then mumbled under his breath that i was being ‘difficult’ and even went as far as to yell at me because i didn’t take what he was trying to give me. When we get on the elevator i angrily snapped at him and said why does me not wanting any more water effect you this much to where you’re calling me ungrateful and getting visibly angry. He was making it all about him. It was very odd. As we were getting off the elevator i decided to hang back , and i went back down to the 1st floor, he was upset with me for that. He called me , requesting i come back upstairs and that he was uncomfortable with me downstairs by myself and he was responsible for my safety. I found it endearing, also a little turned on, but didn’t want to return just yet. When i did end up returning, he was clearly still not ready to talk. He was angry! All because i didn’t want water. It took us 10 min of going back and forth for him to admit he was WRONG and he apologized and asked how could he fix it. It was a lot.\n\nThe 2nd incident we were sitting outside and i was very sleepy and just in a relaxed mood. I’m neurodivergent and sometimes things can get overstimulating for me. He decides to make stomp-clap sounds and just be a little louder than i anticipated and i motioned to him to stop and that im overstimulated. He took that VERY personally and said he felt like i had rejected him! It was nuts. He said that because i hadn’t said that since he’s known me that he was taken aback by me saying i was overstimulated and that he wasn’t sure how he’d respond to that if i said that to him. I told him you’re not going to make me feel bad for neurodivergent and or for feeling overstimulated. When i said that he shut down. Didn’t talk for 10 min. Just because i said that one behavior was overstimulating , does not mean that i find you as a whole overstimulating and that you should stop engaging. \n\nSince we started dating this is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, which means it’s a pattern to a bigger problem. Outside of this issue our relationship is great. I don’t need to create a pro’s/cons list because the pros are so long and I know this really my only con. If he could truly work on himself/this issue like he says he wants to, we could have a prosperous relationship. I’ve asked him why he does this, what happened in his past relationships or his childhood that he’s not sharing with me. He told me that he needed to take a day to gather his thoughts and respond with consideration and intention as he has a really big day at work and he wants to respond carefully.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

This wasn’t some one-sided delusional obsession, you know when you feel it back. Anyway she went home for a week and ever since I noticed her pulling away somewhat. We met up again and it was still great, like always. Laughing, cuddling, great sex and even meeting some close friends of hers. She felt caring and compassionate and all seemed good. Until a day later I received a message to say she was sorry but she had a great time with me but doesn’t feel like dating and that her head is all over the place. It felt very much like quite an abrupt full stop.\n\nI won’t lie, I feel gutted by this but also stupid that I let myself fall for someone so soon. But at the same time I can’t deny there must have been a real connection there. I’m assuming this is because she is uncomfortable with my situation which is absolutely fair enough and in fact I felt that way too initially.\n\nIs this now a lost cause?

I told her that I would like to start a family with her in the future, but right now I don’t feel ready to get married, mainly because I don’t have enough money and because neither of us is working in our professional field yet. In fact, we currently work together in a place that is quite stressful.\n\nShe tells me that I need to change and act more like a man and not like a child, because I’m constantly joking around. I explain that this is just the way I am, while she is more serious. For me, making jokes is a way to cope with life and to relieve stress, although I don’t take everything as a joke. However, it bothers her, and she says she’s fed up with it.\n\nShe also points out that I should arrive at work at least 15 minutes early, while I think arriving on time is enough. I understand her sense of responsibility, but I feel these are differences in upbringing and ways of thinking.\n\nSince we work together, the tension feels even stronger. When there’s stress, I prefer to stay quiet, get the work done, and move on with my life. She, on the other hand, complains a lot and says she wants to quit because she can’t take it anymore. That drains me emotionally, because she ends up getting angry with me when it shouldn’t be that way.\n\nWhen I try to give her advice, she doesn’t want to listen and cuts off the conversation. If I were the one bringing things up about work, she tells me that I’m immature or that I play the victim.\n\nThis past year has been very difficult for me. I was fired from a job where I had been for two years, and I had to go back to this other position where I already knew the environment was stressful and, on top of that, they pay much less. Before, I used to play a lot of sports, study with more discipline, and could afford to buy myself things. Now I come home so mentally and emotionally exhausted that all I want to do is sleep.\n\nI’ve told her that I feel different, even a bit depressed, although maybe that’s not the exact word. But when I share this with her, she responds that what I’m saying doesn’t make sense, that I’m not depressed, that I’m just looking for excuses, and that I play the victim. That hurts me, because what I’m telling her is truly how I feel.\n\nShe is older than me and already has a degree, although she hasn’t found a job in her field. I’m still finishing university. She tells me that she’s close to turning 40 and that she doesn’t see progress in our relationship, especially when it comes to starting a family before it becomes complicated due to age.\n\nI want to find a way to express all of this to her without her responding with the same things as always: that I’m immature, that I play the victim, or that I make excuses. I do want something serious with her, but I feel confused and drained by these dynamics.\n\nMy question: How can I talk to her about these issues in a way that she actually listens, without immediately shutting me down or calling me immature?\n\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: I (30M) want a future with my girlfriend (36F), but she says I need to change my personality and habits to be more “mature.” We argue about work, responsibilities, and stress, and she often dismisses my feelings.

I thought I would be okay with long-term commitment when I started dating, but now I’m not so sure.\n\nI don’t have a fear of commitment; I just feel like it’s not the right time in my life, and maybe not with her, even though I care about her. I think I want to be more stable in my career and emotionally before I make those big decisions.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for advice. I don’t want to stay in a relationship that isn’t fulfilling for either of us, but I also don’t want to hurt her or make a rash decision. She’s a good person, and I care about her deeply, but I’m unsure where to go from here. Is it worth working through this, or should I just let her go and give her the space she deserves?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n**TL;DR**: I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months, but I’m starting to feel indifferent about the relationship.

She and a friend of her went on a train trip trough europe (interrail) and she met a lot of people. \nAt this point i was in the military for 6 months so i already did not have a great time. \nWhen she and her friend were in Nice they met a guy and as he is britain but lives there he offered them to give them a tour through the city of Monaca. (My and my gf had a really really healthy relationship till this point. So she knew i wouldnt have a problem with it) She still asked me if it was fine if this guy showed them around. And i said i dont have a problem with it as long as nothing happens.\nSo at the day they were in monaco i asked her to call me when she gets back to the hotel.\nShe didnt.\nI was really worried something mighr have happend.\nAnyways she told me she and her friend went to grab some drinks with this guy and ended up WITH him at their hotel at 5 in the morning. My gfs friend went then to bed and my gf and this guy stayed up till 8 and smoked cigarettes talking.\nShe fell asleep then as did he.\nI dont think they did anything sexual or so because her friend would have seen them.\nAnyways 2h later they realized he was still there and threw him out.\nMy gf called me told me everything and apologized.\n\nAfter a month of not to much contact she came home. (she always, till this day not any different, is often not texting me back when on vacation. She still is often on her phone but seems like she doesnt care about me or my messages. the same when i am on vacation. she doesnt ask me what is going on) \nThe first 4 days we didnt see each other because she said she needs a little bit of time for herself after travelling with her friend for so a long time.\nThen we met again on the weekend. And went to a ball. Everything seemed to be perfect. There was still love and everything i thought. Anyways 3 days later when i was back at military for a week she texted me she really needs a break with zero contact and she cant tell me what it is about. I was crazily confused. I tried to call her whats up and she just refused to pick up. So i tried to respect her decision. I texted her a week later that her not telling me whats up is eating me up from inside out. And that i would like to meet her and we dont have to talk about what wrong. And so we did. It was ok and everything but i was definitly not ok. A week later she told me she was snapping with this guy from south france for over a month and the both of them said they had feelings for each other. He even offered her to fly to her to meet her again. So she texted me rarely because she was texting somebody else. \nWhat really hurt was that she always told me she loves britain accent and people from france and the kind of music taste that apperently he had. And him living in the area of Nice and everything really made her romanticizing this situationship.\nI was in anexplainable grief. The worst part she said i must not tell anyone because she didnt want my friends and family to think something like that of her.\nSo i had to hide my grief. Which caused an 2 month depression. \nBut on the other hand i somehow was happy she came bakc to me( i think i was still just her safeoption).\nBut still everything got better till the point i realized she still had feelings for this guy SHE ONLY KNEW ONE DAY. \nSo i did probably the worst thing and stalked her phone. I told her and said i know she still thinks a lot about him. (Maybe i should add that she is a person who oftwn doesnt tell what is on her mind. And i asked her often if she still thinks about him and she said no.)\nShe totally freaked out. To the point she really was thinking about breaking up, because i look through her phone. Btw she still had his contact and followed him on instagram.\nThings got still a little bit better till tbe point she told me she doesnt have any feelings for me after we went on a week trip to istanbul and everything seemed as usual. \nAt this time i was studying very very hard to get into medical school.\nShe wasnt very supportive.\nShe then told me she will go on vaccation with another friend of her to nice where she met him.\nYou might be able to imagine how i felt.\nI couldnt really study for one and a half month.\nEven though nothing happend in nice and she didnt meet him(i dont wanna imagine what would have happend) i still was mentally paralyzed and couldnt do anything then stalking her insta counting her snapscore and worrying me brain out. \nAt the last day of her trip she suddenly deleted the last post of us she had on instagram. I confronted her and she was freaking out why i would care \"she never was a person whod like to share her love life online\" bullshit. We had a couple of photos online.\nAnyways i had the feeling i could not talk about it wirh her and went into therapy.\nI realized i had to talk to her and i told myself i would after my test for university.\nAfter my exam her feelings came back. It seemed like the ice of lacking love and attention from her was melting but deep down insinde of me are still very deep wounds i dont know how to get rid of as i think a lot of the topics to talk about, like her cheating and her hurting me, are very hard for me to adress.\nSo todays status is that i will be gone for a trip to australia for nearly 3 months and i am worried she might be hurting me again.\nAnd i know she would as soon as i am gone give me less and less attention and words of affection.\n\nBy this time of a lot of red flags from her side and me putting an unlimited amount of energy into this relationship and her just a very little bit all my friends say i should break up and that i am not in love anymore, they say it is not love it is emotionally being  dependent of her.\n(maybe as an additional information: our relationship dynamic has always been and still is, that i am giving a lot of attention and energy and her only a little, for example today i asked her if wanna do something and she just said it dependa what we would do. I list a lot of very cool things to do as a couple but she says she still has to clean her room and other stuff. So she will be laying in bed watching insta reels instead of doing something with me)\n\nI think every day about breaking up. But i really really love her. I truly do. And it scares me that i would probably be really hurt after the breakup for a long time.\n\nI know she is gonna hurt me again if i stay.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : My gf doesnt give me a lot of energy back. She completely broke my trust and i have deep wounds i cant really get rid of. It is hard to talk with her about things going a wrong way. She looses interest in me as soon as she or me is on vacation.

We were best friends, and knew each other for 2 years before finally getting together. I’m going into 2nd yr of uni (2/3), he’s going into his 3rd year (3/4). So we both have 2 yrs of uni left.\n\nI have Muslim Pakistani parents. His parents are Indian and white, but he doesn’t have any restrictions on him when it comes to pretty much anything. \n\nMy bf emphasised on meeting my parents, and not hiding our relationship because he didn’t want them to hate him if we told them like 1 year into dating. He didn’t want them to think of him as sneaky etc. \n\nWe told them. And suddenly it’s been outlined, that they will not let us live together, or go on holiday together, before marriage.\n\nFor context. I am not a practicing Muslim. My dad accepts this, and my mother knows I don’t practice. I don’t pray- I don’t even know how to pray. Don’t wear a headscarf, I don’t fast unless I’m asked to by my parents during Ramadan. I never have. On top of this, my parents let me wear what I want. Short skirts, backless dresses. I don’t have a curfew when I go see my home friends when I get home from uni (I can drive). I study in London and live away from home (Manchester). I’ve even gone on solo trips which my mum booked for me in Europe (1 day 1 night stuff). \n\nSo for Muslim Pakistani parents- I’m a very free kid.\n\nAnd in my head, I don’t have the ‘Asian’ view, of marrying without dating someone for 2-3 years minimum. Without having lived with them. Me and my bf both share the idea, that living together and marriage should come naturally and not forced. My parents wanted me married between 23/25. \n\nThis all comes back to the idea that, my parents don’t want me to have sex b4 marriage. They can’t believe that nothing would happen between me and my bf before marriage if we stayed under the same roof. But I don’t share the religious view. I have had sex b4, not with him, and not that my parents know. He’s fully okay with waiting for marriage.\n\nMind, we both are staying in London separately rn, we can see each other whenever we want to anyways.\n\nMy parents wanted me to have an arranged type marriage when I got out of uni at 23ish-25. But even if I was single at that point in my life, I don’t think I will ever agree to that? I’m not having an arranged marriage. So why dont I stay in this relationship now if I’ve already accepted I’m going to have to fight later for my freedom no matter how much current relationship goes.\n\nThey are all meeting on Friday and I have to decide:\nA: do I break things off now, and accept my Asian fate that I can’t ever live with a partner before marriage. \nB: Or do I lie to my parents and pretend to accept their terms, sneak around for a few yrs \nC: do I lie to my parents, pretend to accept their terms, and in 2-3 years time; switch up, and turn on them if they still don’t accept.\n\n—\nTLDR:\n\nMy bf has explicitly stated to me. He will not get married with having at least 1 holiday with his partner and also living tg before marriage. \n\nMy parents have stated: I cannot under any circumstances live with my bf/any partner before marriage. \n\nThe options above are what I’m thinking.

This post is going to be extremely long, so you can go to the TLDR incase you are lacking in time.\n\nMe and my girlfriend met last year, we were friends for 2 months then we end up getting into a relationship. She had to shift somewhere else due to work while I'm completing my college. The year has been pretty toxic for me. Initially it was all fun, and everything, But as time passed, she started fighting a lot. For record, she has broke up with me multiple times and returned later drenched in guilt. Last time she broke up was 3 months ago.\n\nShe has had fight with me multiple times, I do not know how normal or abnormal is that, I just do not feel good. Fighting with her involves her making sarcastic names for me \"mr perfect\" \"robotic\" \"saint\" \"mr everything right\" \"shut up\" \"get lost\" and what not, though the fights are infrequent, like weekly or sometimes monthly, I start to resent our relationship more and more.\n\nAlso our love language do not seem to match. I am also very verbally affectionate, she tells me it becomes suffocating for her. She has used this phrase several times \"I feel claustrophobic due to your over-sweetness\". She even included good night, morning messages as a part of them for some reason.\n\nLast week we had fight and this is how it went\n\n\"She said she wants her man to be dominating, and started name-calling and stuff, my reaction is too usually shut off and tell her that I will talk later as the conversation is getting heated. She believes this is her being able to dominate me, and this is making her feel lose interest in me.\n\nWhen I tell her that her actions hurt me. She says, I have to react so strongly to her actions, that she felt compelled to change her behavior, basically she was saying that I need to fight, \"hold my ground\", argue, when she calls me name and stuff, instead of going away and coming back later, because that shows her being able to dominate me. Today I assured her that okay I will lash out and vent too if we got into a fight later on.\"\n\nHonestly I am not that socially intelligent person, hence I try to deploy my conscious thinking a lot of times in social situations, which can feel fake, manufactured, I understand. But I am just trying to improve. She tells me that I am emotionally flat, manufactures a lot of fakeness, and is non confrontational due to fear.\n\nIT has come to the point where I feel bad interacting with her.\n\nYou might think why the hell I am in such a relationship. Well because the place I live in, love marriages rarely happen, it is a third world country, second we both are non-religious, our country is heavily religious, and thirdly we both have certain issues with our parents which will prevent a huge pool of people from dating us. No contact is  a big deal, good luck finding someone like you. and I really love her when shes not being toxic.\n\nSo basically I am a weak man whos afraid of losing her. But I sincerely believe she will improve in future.\n\nI dont even know what is my question. To me it feels like she is also bored of me but sticking due to convenience reasons. It feels very toxic and suffocating.\n\n  \nHow can I proceed after this?\n\nTLDR: Constant fights, name-calling, shut-ups and what not with girlfriend. Insecure feeling when I think of leaving her.

I also want this for myself, but understand it will take a lot of work to get there.\n\n3) My girlfriend dosent really have family, and always imagined that she'd be able to call her partner's family her own. Unfortunately, my family doesn't like her and she does not like them. She doesn't like my family because my mom talks badly about her and always wants to one up her. \n\n4) The fincial stress is killing her. She constantly has to pick up the bills and carrys the mental weight of our relationship in every aspect. She budgets for us, makes the grocery bills, covers for things when I cannot afford it, and plans dates. She doesn't remember that last time I took her out on a date. \n\nSo, what do I do? She is my best friend and I couldn't imagine a life without her. I feel so stupid for behaving like this.

I have had more relationships than I like in the past year, and one of the main reasons most failed was from never being able to see each other, I feel like I'm overreacting but I really like this guy and don't want to just leave.\n\nHe also does a few things that irk me, like telling me to shut up (jokingly) when I take things very literal and always shut down when he says stuff like that. I need to communicate that I hate this to him, but its honestly kinda surprising how he hasn't noticed how quiet I get whenever he says stuff like that.\n\n It seems simple but I'm really scared I'm gonna mess it up and somehow make him angry/sad and drive a rift between us.

He knows I have hookups. We're in a medium-distance, I used to see him 3 to 4 days a week but in July he moved for work and now its about once a month that'll see him. On his days off he'll go home and see his family, which due to family issues he'd rather I wasn't there for. So when l see him its after work and then I'll leave in morning.\n\nWe've been together almost 18 months, and we're at the point where I'm starting to want a deeper commitment but I really feel like that's not going to happen for a while. We've had conversations about this before, we've talked around breaking up but I don't think either of us want to breakup.\n\nThe other night I want to this guy's house, and we hooked-up. He was just lovely. He made sure I felt comfortable and happy and everything. Even after we finished we stayed in his bed just chatting for 2 more hours. He made me feel wanted and desired, not just in a sexual way but in just in the sense he wanted my company.\n\nOnce I got home, I cried. My boyfriend hasn't made me feel like that in months. I'm not saying I want to leave my bf for my hookup; what I want is my boyfriend to make me feel that way. I want him to treat me that way. I want him to show me he cares. And I know that hookups aren't reflective of a real relationship in any sense as they're just intimacy.\n\nThe last time I saw my boyfriend, he wanted my company too but we just felt so distant. My boyfriend is autistic, and gets overstimulated easily espically with physical touch. But even then I miss just being hugged or kissed by him.\n\nI love my boyfriend so so much, and I know if I tell him this it'll break his heart. As I'm sure you can tell we're on a knife's edge as it is. I'm so scared if I talk about this we will breakup, we've been talking about this for months and it really does seem invetable.

We were drinking and at night while winding down he got very…. mean? and started saying we were done, muttering things under his breath and acting completely not like himself. It’s hard to describe but it was essentially drunk blubbering , we got into a huge argument and he just was not clear , not making sense and the next day he apologized said he drank to much and we moved on. i can go into more detail about this but i’ll leave it for the sake of this being a million miles long.\n\nnow every time he drinks too much the same EXACT thing happens. it seems that there is a direct correlation with him drinking to much and him going on a “we are done, what’s wrong with you, i hate you” tirade. it is so strange because this man is so sweet, so put together and seriously a GREAT guy. he’s an amazing friend, helps those around him, super smart and caring but it’s like he turns into a monster when he drinks too much. (NEVER physical) he gets arrogant, condescending, talks down on me the whole 9. \n\ni have vocalized this from instance #1 and he’s very dodgy with his relationship with alcohol. REWIND to the second time this happened. so at this point it happened once, we moved on, he is running a half marathon so we travel to it with friends as a bday trip for him and fo celebrate his run. i meet one of his closest friends and wife and we are having a great time, after his race , he wasn’t feeling great, didn’t eat and drank. i could see in his eyes and actions it was happening… in public , in front of them. he started to get rude, i went to the bathroom with his friends wife, she’s a bit under the influence( nothing alarming just normal) and in the bathroom tells me “hey i just wanted to let u know i can see you’re getting upset , he’s great but i wanted to let u know we actually don’t love it when he drinks, he’s an alcoholic and gets like this.” i was obviously taken aback and i told her i had no idea and told her there was a time where something weird happened but he didn’t mention having an issue, we had drank a few times together including instance #1. she then proceeded to ask me if i knew how his mom passed and she said she died of Cirrhosis and she was a heavy heavy heavy drinker.\n\ni thanked her for the information and i can tell that she wasn’t telling me out of any weird reason, they seem to really care about him and his friend split him from me that night , got him together and in bed and his friends had some convos with me and i could really see how much they care for him and even me just meeting me. Nothing malicious just concerned and getting me up to speed is how i took it.\n\nI never told on her to him, i never brought up his mom to him and i essentially tried to stop drinking with him but haven’t really been successful, he sees what im doing and questions me like “just bc these instances happened it’s bc i was worried about this or that” and always has an answer when i KNOW the answer is deeper. Bunches of things have come up that’ll save energy on but overall it hasn’t been to the point where i wanted to leave because i was trying to work it out and so was he. He knows that i think the drinking is a problem and i told him that if this happens again (its happened probably 4 or 5 times — i know now that im typing it sounds horrible) but i haven’t met his family and he hasn’t met my friends. \n\ni had a trip planned for many months to come to his city (where i was from before i moved) so we can have a big get together and host something at his house. this was yesterday and we had the most PERFECT day, laughs games , very light drinking from everyone, he actually had one drink and made it a point to be so, and it was amazing. at the end of the night my friends hung around a bit longer and i saw him having another drink but again i wasn’t paying attention to him for awhile. we went to bed and he was tearing up saying he wished i could meet his mom and we were talking about how good the day was.\n\nhe said he was going to get water and was downstairs for 30mins i heard noises i called out to him asking if he was ok he reiterated he was just “getting water” he comes back upstairs i smell that he drank something and already knew what was going to happen. i was already on the brink of 5 hours of sleep for work and he turned it into 2 hours. he laid down next to me cuddled up with me and said “hey we are done” i tried to ignore him but he kept waking me up, i moved rooms and he followed me just starting absolute nonsense. i told myself if anything came up on this trip pertaining to this id be done.\n\n\nnext morning i go downstairs and see he SLOPPILY opened a bottle of wine and drank HALF of it, cork everywhere and just a mess. i confronted him and decided i wasn’t going to dance around feelings. bc i always have bc i knew about his mom and didn’t want to hurt him. i told him that drinking was the issue and how would this change moving forward as he was apologetic and told me “everything is going so good im self sabotaging”. i told him that was BS and the one and only reason that happened is bc of the drinking. he’s being defensive and not trying to brush it off and blame it on deeper feelings.\n\ni have never ever dealt with this or anyone who’s had issues with alcohol, is this a situation where if he was sober it would be fine, i don’t want to judge him or lose him but i just don’t feel comfortable with it anymore. he’s met my daughter he’s great and i told him if things went good for a year after this point i would move back (live separately) so we can see how things go but. i just don’t feel comfortable entertaining that if this is happening. \n\nor is this clear cut i need to leave and he needs to work on this alone? it just sucks bc my last relationship was mentally and physically abusive so i feel like i don’t know what the meter is for bad because i had horrible … and i really just need some advice. sorry this was so long\n\ntl;dr boyfriend possibly hid his drinking issue and gets very mean and focused on our relationship after heavy drinking", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Our relationship has always been rooted in tenderness, comfort, and emotional safety. He’s loyal, affectionate, and kind with his words. But lately, that comfort has started to feel more like a trap than a partnership.\n\nI’ve always been more spontaneous, curious, and chaotic in a good way. I like trying new things, going to new places, meeting people, being in motion. He says he wants that too, but in reality, he sticks to what’s familiar. If it were up to him, he’d go to the beach five days a week and stay in his usual routine. Any time I suggest something different, he has a reason why he can’t. I’ve tried planning things together, making chore charts, breaking things into steps, but nothing ever sticks. He’ll say he wants to get out of his comfort zone but never takes action. I’m the one who keeps adapting and compromising.\n\nWe broke up last December and I moved out. He started reaching out again after a few months, saying all the right things and telling me he had changed. I decided to give it one last try. But now it’s September, and the same patterns are showing up again. He talks about change but doesn’t follow through. He wants credit for wanting to be better, but I never see actual growth.\n\nWe recently went on a trip for my brother’s birthday, and I was still grieving the recent loss of my grandmother. Even then, he made the trip about him. He didn’t offer support or step up to help, just stayed in his own world. I kept thinking, I shouldn’t have to ask for this. I shouldn’t have to beg my partner to show up.\n\nThe most frustrating part is how often he says our problem is communication. But I am a very clear communicator. The issue isn’t that I don’t express myself. It’s that he doesn’t want to hear anything that makes him uncomfortable. He avoids hard conversations, dismisses things as “not that serious,” and turns things around on me.\n\nThis breakup feels mature, which makes it even harder. It’s not a blowout. There’s no cheating, no screaming. He’s not a bad person. He’s just not showing up in a way that makes me feel like I have a real partner. And while I love the loyalty and sweetness, I keep wondering if some of his behaviors are just who he is. He says he wants to change, but I honestly don’t know if he ever will. And I’m scared I’ll leave and end up in something worse, but I’m also scared to stay and keep slowly losing myself.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nMy partner is kind, loyal, and emotionally safe in a surface-level way, but avoids growth and change. I’ve tried everything to make this relationship more balanced, but I’m tired of being the only one trying. He says he wants to do better, but nothing ever actually shifts. I’m not sure if I should stay or go, and I’m struggling to tell the difference between settling and being patient.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/throwaway-bettymay_1587", "user": "u/throwaway-bettymay", "text": "Thinking of ending 10+ yr relationship\n\nI would really appreciate the Reddit verdict on if ending my 11 year relationship is the right decision. He knows im considering it.\n\nI (32F) met my partner (37M) when I was 22. I have a history of childhood and relationship trauma. When I met my partner I was heavily depressed and had lost my self-esteem and had shut down emotionally from a toxic relationship and was in therapy while finishing University.\n\nHe's very introverted, and a kind person generally. When we met he was good at cleaning, and accepted my boundaries and we had some things in common. He has always been happy to go with the flow and help if I ask him to do something. \n\nInitially I knew I didnt have any chemistry with him emotionally but I thought maybe love would grow and that it was better than being with someone toxic. However over the years, while weve had good times and bought a home and pets together, theres been a lot of issues:\n\n1. He has always wanted to have his own business so he doesnt have to report to anyone, though his businesses didnt do well for a long time. This meant at times I was the sole earner and I struggled with this mentally as if I lost my job we would risk the house/pets. Financial security is very important to me as I grew up poor and he didnt. When I asked him to step up and get a proper job it was always \"ill do it as a last resort\". I also manage the bulk of home finances and bills and logistics - he pays for half of mortgage and some bills/ad hoc groceries. I pay for and organise everything else.\n\n2. Over the years he became very dependent and I became codependent. He took less and less initiative around the house and if he did do something it would only be cleaning areas he uses most not other joint areas like bathrooms. I took on more and more maintenance, home improvements, and cleaning ontop of working 2 jobs. My neighbour would ask me why Im mowing the lawn and not him (I have a chronic pain issue). He would do things if I asked or would help me, but only to bare minimum standard which just made me feel like it was easier to do myself, and never off his own bat. He spent all his time working on business stuff (that was below minimum wage most of the time), going to the gym and playing video games.\n\n3. We have no emotional connection, and I dont love him. He doesnt show emotion or  talk to me about how he feels and would shut down if I was upset or listen but then just not check in beyond a quick \"how you feeling\" even when he knows Im very depressed or upset about something, which led to me just bottling everything up and repressing all of my own emotions. We also show love in very different ways. He just wants physical, which I have done over the years but it has felt more and more like a chore for me. I however have spoilt him like planning fancy dinners, taking him on surprise holidays (paid for by me), buying him very expensive gifts, cooking him lovely dinners. I dont need to be spoiled, but he never even calls me beautiful or makes me feel appreciated or celebrated or seen in a way I feel loved and valued.\n\n4. Broken trust. Theres been times when I needed him to show up and he didnt, or he made me feel disrespected. A few examples, I was having a severe an asthma attack one night and he reluctantly came to emergency with me (I had to drive). We waited hours, and I could see he was tired so I suggested he go home, though I wanted him to stay but didnt say it - he did go home (I actually suspect he might be on the spectrum? He has very low emotional intelligence). Another time when his business was doing badly, he racked up $15K on my credit card with business expenses. I had to get him a remote job to get him out of debt, and he barely did his job, so I helped him do his job so he wouldnt get fired and could pay off the debt.\n\nI told him in May I was miserable and was thinking about ending things. Since then his response has been to do more house stuff (though still has to ask stuff sometimes) and its still maybe only just maybe 50% of the house cleaning/basic maintenance. He has tried a bit in terms of being a bit more emotional and chrcking in with me emotionally, but it still doesnt feel like he understands me, and one time it felt a bit like he was guilt tripping me by being upset about no sex. He also planned one basic lunch date.\n\nHe said hes trying and that he wants me to be happy but whatever I decide he will accept and wants me to act like things are \"normal\" until then so that he doesnt get anxious. \n\nI just have nothing left to give, and dont love him in a romantic way. I think I know I should leave, but theres nothing that bad about our relationship so idk if Im asking for too much. Hes never mean or hurtful deliberately, he is jusy oblivious and doesnt know how to think about other's needs.\n\nTLDR: nothing majorly wrong, nice guy, but dont feel emotionally supported or loved by my partner of 11 years in the ways I need and feel taken for granted and like his version of \"trying\" is still bare minimum leading me to be very resentful.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

{"id": "u/SparkyJambalaya_1594", "user": "u/SparkyJambalaya", "text": "How can I (18NB) help my boyfriend (18M) through his lack of motivation?\n\nI really hope this post makes sense and covers all the bases it needs to. I can definitely clarify anything in the comments. I just really some advice on what I should do in this situation. Has anyone else loved someone who had a loss of motivation, and how did that work out? \n\nSome context: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18NB) have been happily dating for about a year and 2 months now, mostly long-distance, but now we live about 30 mins from each other. The honeymoon phase was like no other. We clicked so well on so many different levels, had similar goals for our futures, ideas about life, and dreams of what we could become together. He gave me sweet little gifts, always had the time and space to talk, supported me through a harassment incident (which is now resolved), and basically was everything I'd ever wished for in a partner. Intimacy was fantastic in all its forms, and not a day went by that I ever stopped wishing for more. I know it seems naive to say we were perfect, but it really did seem like we were. I was so certain we were a forever couple.\n\nBut recently things have started to shift. After a rough period during the summer that we patched up, the school year began to put a lot of stress on us both. I noticed that he began to pull away, saying he wanted to be more present and foster more friendships. I have been taking so many classes that my one reprieve during the day was spending all the time I could with him. As he pulled away, I anxiously drew closer, which spiraled us into the place we are now. Our intimacy has tanked, the small things we did for each other are dwindling into nothing. We barely text, and the time we spend with each other is feeling more and more empty.\n\nOn Friday I held a small party, and he ended up just staying the night instead of braving the city traffic back to his place. He'd been pretty distant during the party, and I didn't know what was going on. So as we were headed to bed, I decided to be a bit more assertive about the lack of intimacy I have been experiencing. About a week or so ago my boyfriend and I had a talk and he said that it would really help him if I could be more honest and assertive about what I need and want from him. So, I thought that night would be good to be honest about what I needed.  \n\nI didn't go exactly how I expected. He ended up coming clean about feeling unmotivated and suffering with so much self-doubt. Being at college has made him feel like nothing he will ever do is going to be enough to rival what anyone else does (he's in an arts school), and it makes him want to just give up. He said it would be easier to be alone, to feel nothing, to stop hurting everyone around him. He cried a lot, the first time he's ever done that in front of me. He said he knows he loves me, but he just can't feel it right now. He can't see our future when the future is so daunting. Everything is just impossible. I thought about leaving, but I want to help him work through this.\n\nYesterday we had a longer, more coherent call about everything that's been going on, and he's going to see the school counselor and uncover why he's starting to put so much pressure on himself. We likened the issue to restoring a painting: sometimes the old varnish needs to be removed to reveal the vibrancy underneath. It went incredibly well, and that call truly did feel like us, the old us. We cried, laughed, and got very deep with each other. I really am starting to understand the pressure he's under right now, and we're building some plans to regain at least parts of our relationship.\n\nBut all that is just a start, and I know there's going to be lots of rough days in our future as we work through this together. I still really want to do this together, so comments saying to break up without any other reasoning are probably a little unnecessary, sorry. I'm really looking for advice on how I can support him through this period, and what happened to any other couples experiencing burnout and lack of motivation. I believe our relationship can be repaired and return to its former glory, and I still see our forever.  \n\nSorry this was so long, but **TLDR: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18NB) have been together for 1ish years, and everything was great until school started, and now he's suffering from lack of motivation for his future that's impacting our relationship. He wants to change and is trying, and I want to know what else I can do for him?**", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I love that he’s smart, hardworking, cooks for me daily, respects my boundaries, and has taught me healthier communication. But I’m overwhelmed by his poor hygiene, messiness, immaturity (not locking doors, no helmet, hasn’t seen a dentist in 6 years), and the fact that I don’t feel protected with him. He’s also lost a lot of weight and shaved his beard, which affected my attraction more than I expected. I feel guilty because I keep saying yes to sex during the day but backing out later, and he can sense I’m not attracted to him. I want to want him again, but I don’t know if attraction can come back or if I’m trying to change our situation vs. trying to change *him*.\n\nI (25F) feel horrible because my boyfriend (25F) and I just moved in together after almost 5 years of dating, and on top of adjusting to a new city and starting med school, I’m struggling with the fact that I’ve lost physical attraction to him, and I don’t know how to build it back (but I want to badly). I have realized this especially bc, though he respects me and never pressures me to, I feel bad constantly saying no to sex or agreeing in the moment and then dreading it later. I want to want him again, but between the stress of school and many things I'll elaborate on (our messy apartment, his slow changes with hygiene and self-care, the way he’s stopped taking care of himself physically, and the fact that I don’t always feel protected with him), my attraction feels like it’s at zero and that scares me sm.\n\nFirstly I will say there are a ton of things I love and appreciate about him, he is an incredibly hard worker and incredibly smart, care so much for his work and being a mentor to others in our field too, he is a great cook and cooks for me every day especially bc I hate cooking (and I always compliment him on his food, even if I dont love it, bc cooking for those he loves seems to be one of his love languages), he’s helpful and great when it comes to school, and, the biggest one, he’s taught me such healthier ways of communicating than the violent ways I grew up with. He cares about me, he’s attracted to me, and when it comes to sex, he always respects my boundaries and makes sure I want to. I know he genuinely tries to be a good boyfriend for me.\n\nBut I can’t deny the other side. He’s a messy and honestly kind of gross person when it comes to his space and sometimes hygiene, and leaves things everywhere. He’s aware of his bad habits and says he wants to change, but the change is happening so, so slowly. Many of these habits I think we can work past as we learn how to live together. However, one that has been bothering me a ton: he hasn't been to the dentist in almost 5 years for no reason at all but laziness, even though he is also training to be a healthcare practitioner. I get so worried that habits like this will translate to our future kids (I know it's an extrapolation but we are in our mid 20s so I do want to think ahead a bit). Genuinely I am so scared of being a \"married single mother.\"\n\nAnother big thing is that I rarely feel safe or protected with him, which is huge. I don't love the terms feminine and masculine energy, but if feminine energy is being able to (when you want to) turn off your brain when with your partner bc you trust he’ll do his best to keep you safe, I feel like I can never do that. Not that he doesnt care about me, he just acts like a frail kid who’s clueless sometimes and I hate having to take on the “masculine” role. If we’re in a dangerous neighborhood and I voice being uncomfortable, he’ll make fun of me or reprimand me for “feeding into stereotypes,” forgetting that as a Black woman I need to be careful of my surroundings and can’t navigate the world the way he can as a white man. He forgets to lock our front door all the time and I am the one each night going to make sure theyre all locked, he makes jokes when I mention the importance of closing the windows at night or when we leave, and he won’t wear a helmet when biking even though all his friends do (I add this in to show the immaturity, he bikes everywhere and has literally seen plenty of patients die due to not wearing a helmet and yet is still stubborn). He hasn’t gone to the dentist in over six years and avoids scheduling his own doctor appointments like I said before. These things make me feel more vulnerable to harm with him than if I were on my own, and that’s a really hard feeling to carry in a relationship. Besides cooking, I don’t feel like he makes my life easier, but theyre all action things that I feel like one could work on, but bc it’s so many idk if I am being realistic.\n\nOn top of that, I feel so bad because every single day that my boyfriend asks if we can have sex, I say “sure, we totally can that evening,” but as the night goes on, I get really stressed out often because of how much work I have to do, and I ultimately, almost inevitably, end up saying no. My ADHD is really getting at me, and the additional thing I am so upset to admit is that just because of the vibes of our relationship right now, and everything I described before, I’m just not physically attracted to him right now. I forgot to add that he lost so so much weight since I first met him, and I feel bad that I’m not attracted to him but I have known for years that I am not super into really skinny men. He lost 50 pounds (not due to any physical or mental illness or struggle, simply bc when he’s busy he “forgets” to eat as if he’s not a 6ft grown man with a fast metabolism and then eats like 1500 cal a day max), he’s not going to the gym, he’s not eating enough and gets super upset when I asked if he’s eaten, just for him to respond that he had a bagel 10 hours prior. One thing I loved and complimented often was his beard (many other ppl did too) bc he looked so much more manly with it and less like a child, but he got rid of it. I should love him either way but wow that made a bigger difference in my attraction to him than I thought. And when I ask him to bring it back he gets annoyed that I keep bringing it up and am not just attracted to him now. He didnt even need to shave the beard, whatever. Anyway, after I say during the day (admittedly often bc I feel like I need to out of obligation or to not hurt his feelings again) that we can have sex, the evening comes, and he’s super touchy and everything, and I’m just not in it, and he can sense it.\n\nHe recently literally asked me, “I feel like you’re not attracted to me, don’t initiate anything.” And he’s right. I don’t feel attracted to him, and I don’t know how to fix that but I want to. I feel bad constantly saying no all the time, especially when I’ve said yes previously. He respects me and never pushes, but I just feel bad constantly letting him down. I know sex is important in our relationship, and I don’t know how to approach this right. I am positive that my libido is not low bc of the way I think about or look at other guys, but I don’t want to be that person. It’s despicable behavior and I only want to have eyes for my partner, but I don’t know how to cultivate that. \n\nSometimes, I feel low moments when I feel pretty sure this relationship is not for me, because, though I would be hurt, I’d also be a bit relieved if he like cheated on me or something and gave me a reason to leave and date someone I am more physically attracted to. But at the same time, I want to try, because I also acknowledge that my recent bouts of depression and stress from all these changes could be resulting in me being much more negative than needed. I don’t want to hurt him.\n\nWhat I’m struggling with is this: I don’t know where the line is between trying to change our situation (helping him with his unhealthy habits, us working on communication, me learning how to manage my stress better) versus trying to change him as a person (his nature, his personality, who he really is). And I don’t know if it’s even possible for physical attraction to come back once it feels gone, people talk all the time about cultivating it but I usually see how that stems from personality and behavior, the latter of which I am struggling to be attracted to also.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar spot, how did you know the difference between asking for change vs. realizing you just weren’t compatible? And if you did stay, did attraction ever come back?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

She says I'm not romantic enough, but I've been showing my love through actions. The two weeks we spent confined together in my small apartment have intensified this issue, and now I'm afraid of losing her.\n\n**Background:** We've been together for 1.5 years, and it's one of the best relationships of my life. We've talked about a future together, including buying land and building a home. Over our time together, we’ve traveled to Greece, been to a wedding, gone to the theater and cinema, and taken walks. I’ve bought her flowers occasionally and am always affectionate, trying to escalate touch and show my romantic side. I've been helping her with the renovation of her apartment, which I'm supposed to move into at the end of the month. We didn't have any major issues before this period.\n\n**The Recent Events:**\n\n* For the past two weeks, we've been living together in my small apartment because of her renovation. This was our second time living together for an extended period, but the first time was different—she was often away for work, so we had more space. This time we were confined together while she was on sick leave and I was working from home. This situation, combined with our personalities, intensified the feeling of being overstimulated.\n* A week ago, she told me I'm not romantic enough. This led to a more serious conversation where I opened up about my feelings, including a past situation that deeply hurt me. She apologized for her behavior, something I didn't expect, and assured me she doesn't want to change me and wants to stay with me because she loves me.\n* This morning, she told me she's afraid we'll burn out and that moving in together might not be a good idea right now. This was a shock to me because it was her idea from the beginning for me to move in. She thought it was silly for me to pay rent when we could live together. We had already talked through my initial skepticism, and I gave notice on my apartment a month ago. She knows I'm supposed to move in soon.\n* This triggered my fears, and I'm now afraid she wants to end things. I am struggling with overthinking, and I'm questioning if my fears are justified.\n\n**The Future:**\n\n* After the renovation is done, she will have a new job as a lecturer and will continue to run her private practice. I'll have my own room in her bigger apartment, giving us both more space and time for our own lives. I'll also be closer to my gym, so I'll be more focused on my own things. I believe this will help us balance our individual lives with our shared one.\n* I suggested a \"trial period\" for living together, during which we'll focus on giving each other more personal space and planning more romantic activities, like date nights. I want to show her that I can be both the reliable partner she needs and the romantic man she desires.\n\n**My question for you:** I'm looking for advice on how to navigate this crucial stage in our relationship. What are some effective ways to balance my practical nature with her need for romance? What steps can we take to make sure that moving in together strengthens our bond rather than weakening it? And if the trial period doesn't go as planned, what is the best way to approach the situation at the end of the month?

We do get on video calls often, and he has seen pictures of me. For reference, I am approx 250 lbs and 5 foot 6. I have told him that I am heavier than I look in pics and on cam, and he says there is no issue with that at all but he has been with a woman as large as me. As of today, we both confessed that we are falling in love but we are both afraid that the connection we have now will be different when we meet in person, but he is planning a trip to come and see me next month to find out how real this is.\n\nWhen on cam or in pics, I VERY MILDLY edit them so that I don't have bags under my eyes or dark spots on my skin - but I do NOT change my facial structure or put fake make up filters on or any of that catfishy stuff. I simply wanted to present myself in the best light possible for him while we were getting to know each other. When we are on cam, I never stand up to show him my belly because I am ashamed of it. I am currently losing weight, but I have a very long way to go. My largest fear is that he will see me in person and will not be attracted to me without the limited perspectives he has been shown up to this point. He says he is aware that bodies change as we age and that my weight may go up or down but he is attracted to me for who and what I am, not what my body looks like because he has not met me in person, nor has he seen a full body pic of me. I want him to know what he will be coming overseas for, and I want him to see all of my imperfections before he buys his non-refundable ticket. I am terrified that when I do, he will no longer want me and I will lose him. I am afraid that all of this connection we believe we have will vanish if I am not exactly what he has built me up to be in his mind by filling in the blanks with rose colored glasses.\n\nOur connection feels so strong and we are such excellent communicators that I honestly feel like he is my person, the one I wasn't looking for but was always destined to find. He says he looks at me and sees his wife. I can't bear the thought of him rejecting me because I wasn't 100% transparent about my physical beauty. \n\nDo you think that our connection can be enough for him to still love me, even if I am not as good looking as he imagined me to be? Is what I am doing a form of deception or lie? Should I send him full body pics and just see what happens?

So we decided to open our relationship… for the first month I tried to talk with people but I just get bored I’m not gonna like I have tried and I have flirt with people but it’s not my thing, however I date someone that is like my friend with benefits, we date to fuck and sometimes I sleep in his house but that’s it. My bf knows about him. \n\nIn my boyfriend’s side I know he talk to people really frequently and date people too more than I do and in my case I don’t like to know when he is with someone so sometimes he disappear because he is busy with someone and few weeks ago it is hurting me more than I thought, but everything crash out when two days ago I sign up on his instagram (I didn’t know that it was going to work but it did) and I saw some chats that really destroyed me and make me feel really bad and sad because seeing him flirting with other people even when I knew it, seeing the messages makes me feel really jealous like it was a cheating when it was not \n\nI don’t know what change, the last two months I was super relax and chill because I didn’t know what he was doing I didn’t know about his dates so I never felt bad or jealous, but I knew about the last two dates that he had because he made a mistake and didn’t knew how to hide it from me. \n\nNow I’m trying to recover from that but sometimes I have some breakdowns about overthinking d about it and I don’t know what to do. I think about if the best option is to break but is really hard we lived together in my country but I wanted to made some money and work on my future because in my country the opportunities are 0. So that’s why I moved from there but i don’t want to be here for a long long time I just wanted to make some money and work but I don’t have any plan of coming back in 3 years, but at the same time he is the love of my life we don’t fight never he understands me as nobody has ever done he never treats me bad even when he is mad, when we were as a mono relationship he never cheated on me, the only reason to break is the distance and it makes really hard because how do you break your relationship with someone when you don’t have any reason to? \n\nI really want to make it works but I don’t know why", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/CandyTemporary7074_1604", "user": "u/CandyTemporary7074", "text": "Two years after breakup. These lessons changed me completely.\n\nIt has been almost two years since the day my relationship ended. I still remember sitting on the floor of my apartment that night with my phone in my hand waiting for a message that never came. I replayed every detail in my head like I was trying to rewrite the ending. Every corner of the city felt haunted. Even the songs I used to love felt poisoned.\n\nAround that time I watched my favorite Rohmer movie *Conte d’hiver*. The way the main character held onto love with almost spiritual devotion hit me hard. That was me. My love had become an obsession, almost like a religion. Regret turned into a daily ritual. I analyzed every moment like scripture, asking myself what I had done wrong. It consumed me. But over time that obsession started to shape me. It didn’t just hurt, it forced me to rebuild my life piece by piece and become a better version of myself.\n\nI learned that heartbreak is real pain, not just in your mind. Neuroscience shows rejection activates the same brain areas as physical injury. That’s why my chest felt like it was tearing open every morning. Guy Winch’s TED Talk on emotional first aid reminded me to treat a broken heart like a broken bone. I stopped pretending I was fine. I cried when I needed to, journaled when the noise got loud, and reached out to friends instead of isolating. That honesty became the first step in healing.\n\nSelf-compassion became my anchor. Kristin Neff’s work showed that people who treat themselves kindly recover faster. At first it felt fake to tell myself “you are doing your best.” But slowly it worked. The shame eased. Writing also became medicine. I wrote short entries about values I wanted to carry forward and red flags I ignored. That turned regret into a plan instead of a prison.\n\nSleep nearly broke me. My nights were restless until I tried Andrew Huberman’s simple tools, morning sunlight, physiological sighs, and non-sleep deep rest. Movement and light helped reset my body. Learning about oxytocin and dopamine explained why I felt like I was going through withdrawal. It wasn’t weakness. It was biology. That realization made it easier to replace the old bond with new routines like working out, volunteering, and building friendships.\n\nBooks & podcasts became my teachers. Attached by Amir Levine is a bestseller that made me rethink how I show up in relationships. This book will make you question everything you think you know about love. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk is the best healing book I’ve ever read. It shows how the body stores grief and gives tools to release it. Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin podcast made me feel less alone listening to couples work through real struggles. Huberman Lab gave me science I could actually apply to my sleep and mood. The School of Life YouTube channel offered short bursts of philosophy that kept me grounded when I was tempted to spiral. And a friend pushed me toward daily expressive journaling. That practice helped me turn obsession into lessons I could use. Also my friend recommended me BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It takes books, expert talks, and research and turns them into personalized podcasts. You choose the length and even the host’s voice. I picked a smoky Samantha-from-Her style voice that made the episodes feel intimate. One session blended Esther Perel’s interviews, Gottman Institute research, and neuroscience on bonding. It explained why I was still reaching for my phone at midnight and gave me concrete steps to break the cycle. Reading helped me more than therapy ever did. Honestly. \n\nAttachment theory also gave me clarity. Esther Perel’s talks made me see how my anxious tendencies shaped the relationship. I began practicing “secure” behaviors like setting boundaries and being direct. For the first time I realized regret could be fuel instead of a chain.\n\nAlmost two years later the pain is no longer sharp. What started as obsession has shaped me into someone stronger, clearer, and more secure. I don’t carry the loss like a religion anymore. I’m ready to say goodbye. And I want to thank my ex, for being the reason I learned how to rebuild my life.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "INSOMNIA", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

My boyfriend and I have been doing long distance for 9 months now, we partially lived together before for 2 years and in the same city for a year after that. When we are together, in person, things are amazing. Never felt lonely or even an ounce of sadness.\n\nThings have been a little hard on us since i moved. I do try to go back home every 3 months but ofc majority is long distance.\n\nMy issue here is that i want to feel connected and in my opinion doing things together, is what will hold us together. So i had a conversation with my man, told him that we should build a routine where we do a dinner date once a week. Not a big ask tbh. This conversation happened 3 months ago, i initiated the first couple dinner dates and also a modelling clay date( super cute, this page really has some amazing ideas) but nothing from his end.\n\nWhen we did nothing for a month, i sat him down again, had this whole conversation again, patiently, politely, explained my feelings. Even went ahead and shared this amazing thread with him about long distance date ideas. But nothing again. It’s always excuses, or we’ll do something soon yada yada.\n\nIts now been two months since, after multiple conversations about how I’m juggling work and school and still want to make time for us according to his schedule to feel closer to him, and even providing him the tools ON HOW TO DO THIS, i feel tired.\n\nI feel unheard and told him that my emotional needs are clearly not being met. I can’t always plan and take the initiative, it feels like I’m forcing him to things with him. He reassures me but nothing ever happens.\n\nI told him a couple days ago (while weeping) (i was also pmsing v hard) that i need a break. Its now been 3 days that we haven’t spoken and obviously i love him and miss him. I just don’t know what to do at this point, what to say.\n\nI would appreciate any and all suggestions, just not criticism because i know what i want and i know i’m not asking for too much.\n\nWe are both 27 in case y’all are wondering.

Looking for advice regarding US health insurance, travel insurance, and hospital bills. What can we do?\n\nHi Reddit, this is our first time posting looking for advice. To be honest, it’s kind of a hail Mary. But we're really needing/hoping we could receive some guidance on what to do with my current situation. Apologies in advance for any reddit mistakes and thank you for your patience. \n\nTLDR; My (29M, US citizen) fiancée (30F, Brazilian) is visiting for a couple months on a tourist visa while we wait for her K1-Fiancée visa to be approved. Six days into visiting she was in a grease fire accident which resulted in 3rd degree burns to all of her right arm and hand from the bicep down, her right thigh and the majority of her left leg and foot. She’s now out of the hospital and recovering. Her travel insurance medical expenses are capped out at $150,000 and they said they are not negotiating prices with the hospital, leaving us with potentially over $112,000 in medical debt unless something can be done to help reduce it. This whole thing has been devastating and a nightmare. We've been in an LDR for almost 6 years, and right before we’re finally starting our life together, this happens. Any advice, tips or tricks to navigating this would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n\nA little background on us and the circumstances around her visiting the US. My fiancée and I have been in a long-distance relationship for 6 years come October. We are currently going through the K1-Fiancée visa process and are approaching the final stages, where she will be required to visit the U.S. embassy in Brazil to finish the process.  Back in July, she was amicably released from my full-time job in Brazil. She was given advance notice of her last day, so we decided she should travel to the US for a few months on her tourist visa while we wait. The logic was if she have nothing to do because she’s unemployed, she might as well be here with me during it and help set up the apartment for her permanent arrival. \n\nShe arrived on August 4th and everything was going great. Then on August 9th, while I was away at work she was trying to cook lunch for me. She was doing a deep fry recipe, but it was her first (and last) time ever deep frying anything (her words). The oil started smoking and then caught on fire. She wasn't sure what to do when the flames started to reach the wooden cabinets above the stove, so she tried and move the oil outside onto my apartment’s balcony. While moving the pan a little bit splashed on her hand, resulting in dropping it. The oil spilled onto her right arm/hand, right thigh and close to the entire lower left leg and foot. Thankfully as soon as the oil hit the carpet, the fire went out immediately and no further damage happened, and our dog was completely unharmed. She knocked door to door looking for help and eventually was saved by my downstairs 80yo neighbor, who called me while she got into the shower to manage the pain. \n\nWhen I arrived, I rushed her to the closest emergency room. She was stabilized until she could be transferred to another hospital with a full body burn unit. The only one in the state. She was treated very well by the staff there. Nurses, doctors, therapists, everyone. They communicated great and really helped to keep us as comfortable and at peace as possible. In her words, the only bad part of the stay was the food, but that could be expected, I think. Monday, August 11th was her first procedure to have the dead and damaged skin removed from her arm removed to see if she needed grafts. The doctors ultimately determined grafts would be necessary to all her burns with exception of some small spots from oil splashing on her legs. They started with a \"fake skin\" graft (Allograft) on her arm, and a deep clean of all her wounds. After the procedure, it was the worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Replacing the initial burns as her new 10/10 on the pain scale. \n\nHer second procedure was on August 15th. She had the fake skin removed from her arm, dead tissue removed from her legs, everything deep cleaned again then finally the skin grafts were stapled, with skin being taken from good spots of her thighs and calves. The day after that procedure was the new worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Then they didn't touch any of her wounds for daily cleaning or anything for 4 days. On the 19th, she had all her staples that were holding the grafts in place removed and got her wound care/cleaning (not a deep clean) again. The skin grafts looked pretty cool to be honest. Her arm looked like it was covered in dragon scales. After another 4 days of intense PT exercises and healing, plus some sessions with her PT coach (that I nicknamed Ms. Sunshine) she was doing well enough to go home by August 24th.\n\nNow, thankfully she was fortunate enough to have very good travel insurance through her MasterCard that paid for the trip. It covered up to $150,000 in her medical expenses. By the way, interesting fact, medical expenses covered by travel insurance does NOT count as health insurance. Which was a pain in the ass because we had been dealing with the contracted health insurance company \"AXA\", who struggled to communicate with us and especially the hospital. Adding to all the hassle and confusion and smoke (pun intended), we were struggling/unable to get a solid answer on what they (AXA) were covering, which was very worrisome. When you've been in a state-of-the-art burn unit for 15 days and simply existing in the room cost us over $11,000 a day, she capped out on the $150,000 quickly. IF her insurance actually covers their share and doesn’t weasel out on anything, then the additional costs are one of our last a major issues. \n\nWe still haven't gotten the bill, but we got an estimate with detailed items of $224,400.18 that included medicine, wound care, procedures and the room rate. We were keeping track of that bill almost twice a week but after she was discharged our new estimate also had specific charges for every doctor stacked on. Resulting in a surprise extra sum of $38,553.14. Making the new total expenses $262,953.32 (which is a terrifying prospect). After looking at all the itemized expenses, the only thing that stood out for us (besides the surprise extra charges) was that there was no change in the room price (over $11k) even after we got moved to a different floor, unit, in a room less than half the size and with far less active nursing.\n\nNow, my fiancée and I have decent savings accounts that could help some. But nothing that could cover this potential additional $112,000 in debt. Our savings accounts were supposed to be to help us start a life together, not... this. Aside from the medical expenses her travel insurance covered for her mom to travel here to help take care of her, which has been a huge blessing to both of us. The insurance is also offering to cover both her and her mom’s flights back home to Brazil once she’s recovered enough to deal with airport germs. We simply are overwhelmed and don't know what to do about all this, and we hardly know anything about hospital bills, negotiations or dealing with insurance companies. Plus, the hospital keeps giving us the run around on who to talk to regarding billing or negotiations. \n\nThere's also been a lot of other surprise expenses, all hitting at the exact same time as this accident. It's made our finances even more tight and stressful. This is just overall so difficult to deal with on so many levels, especially when you have no idea the scope of the systems you're dealing with. It's just been a nightmare from start to finish, and it's not even done yet. Please give us an outside view looking in. We're trying to remain calm, but the looming debt gets closer every day. Any relevant experiences, tips, tricks, or advice; it's all welcome. We will also try to answer any questions that are asked. What can we do?\n\nThank you,\n\nT & M", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I don't know what to think or feel\n\nWe dated for about 6 years. We never met in person. Covid happened, then I had a pretty intense autistic burnout (diagnosed, not speculated) that I'm still recovering from. \n\nWe stuck together through everything. We were each other's best friend. We have shared life goals, values, and interests. We have had our arguments and problems, but we overcame them and got through it stronger than before. I would have married him the moment I met him. I was that confident in our partnership. \n\nIn July, I said he should come meet my puppies. He responded saying that he thought we should break up. \n\nHis parents were having unexpected health issues and increasingly relying on him. My dad is developing dementia, and we had already agreed that I cannot leave my family here. \n\nSo, he felt we should break up due to these circumstances. \n\nI was gutted, but I amicably agreed. I wasn't going to cry and beg him to stay or pressure him to change his mind. I accepted it. I fought through the horrible, relentless pain of that loss because I didn't want to lose him as a friend, too.\n\n(This year has been a shit show. My therapy dog died, my cat died, my sister is moving to the opposite side of the world. A lot of loss. Our breakup was an ocean of grief, and I was already drowning.)\n\nYesterday, I told him that we couldn't be some messy, in-between *thing* of being emotionally entrenched like romantic partners, but just friends. I said no one we dated would be okay with that, and our friendship would inevitably end. He said he still felt we could overcome this and be together again. Then he said he would stop messaging for a while to work through how he feels. \n\nI'm baffled. I'm sick. I'm so overwhelmed. \n\nI know humans are irrational. I'm irrational. But I'm also diagnosed autistic, and I don't know what to do with all these puzzle pieces that just don't make a coherent pocture.\n\nI cannot understand how he leaves me. How I force myself to process the grief. How I finally stop getting waves of despair whenever he messages me. How I find peace with just being friends.\n\nAnd now we're not talking at all, because he's not over the romantic relationship that *he ended* ??\n\nFuck. It feels like I delayed the true loss by two months. I can't wrap my head around any of this. I'm sad, but tbh I'm angry too. There's just this big empty feeling in my gut.

{"id": "u/fyndor_1630", "user": "u/fyndor", "text": "I (44M) didn't think it would be this hard to fix the marriage with my wife (41F)\n\nMy wife and I have had a rocky relationship basically since our second kid was born 8 years ago. We do not do well together under stess, and the process of the first year with kid #1 nearly broke us. I always wanted more than one kid, but I was ready to cut it off at one after that first experience. It seemed like a risk to go through that process again after we had just barely survived the first time. But I let her convince me it would be ok, and it very much was not ok. Unfortnately, not only did it fracture our relationship again, but this time it never repaired.\n\nFrom what I can gather, essentially I'm looking at post-pardum depression, converting in to just plain ole' depression, for my wife. My contribution to the mess, from my own biased but self-reflecting opinion, was originally my severe ADHD complicating things. At the start of this, I was undiagnosed and my coping skills having gone 40 years without knowing I had ADHD were not great. They still arent really, but knowing helps. At this point though, unfortunately I am adding my own dose of depression into the mix. And that is the real problem to fixing this at this point I think.\n\nWe snapped during COVID. She cheated, and I threw a hail marry and moved the family across the country to be with her family in hopes of saving our marriage. I think overall it's been good for the kids because family, but I did not think I would be sitting here in 2025 and still living in a loveless marriage. That is really just breaking me and is what eventually lead to my depression. I thought I could just whether the storm, I could eventually get her out of the depression, and we could move forward. It seemed better than the alternative. I had no idea it could possibly go this long, but given the effort that has been made, it really no surprise. She makes zero effort, would even admit as much, because years ago she decide she would just wait for the divorce to fix her own issues. I assume that still to this day, in her mind, I am the sole cause of our issues. And she had me believing it for a while too. After years of self reflection, I know I'm not perfect, I can see my flaws, but I can also see I am not the sole reason for our issues. My biggest core issue really is just ADHD and my garbage skills at dealing with it. Now I have the additional issue that being unloved for so long has left me sad and bitter, so when conflict does arise I am not good at biting my tongue and descalating anymore.\n\nAt this point, unfortunately, I think it is safe to say I am more depressed than she ever was or is. I have been white knuckling life for 5 years straight and it has broken me. And the really sad thing to me is that, I feel like if I didn't have this depression, I think I could repair our relationship at this point. I know what it would take, but she has been so consistently breaking me down for 5 years that I don't know if I have the willpower in me to actually pull it off anymore. It's all the simplest shit too. For instance, our house looks like a depression nest. It doesn't look like horders you see on TV, but some some downscaled version of that kind of filth. My 8 yr old is messy as hell, it really is pretty fair to say he has caused 80% of the mess in our house. He uses the ground as a trash can essentially. I'm sure this fucked up relationship somehow probably shaped that. If I were to guess the single biggest issue with moving forward is how messy our house is. I have come to realize it is one of the significant issues in this fucked up situation, but damn if it doesn't just seem like an impossible mountain at this point. For one it is just me doing all the work, she won't lift a finger. And that 8 year old really will turn right around and trash the place in a weeks time, so when I muster the strength to sit down and clean a room, I will have my wife critize how I didn't clean it nearly enough and how it's not up to her standards. That fucks with me. The house is so fucked its probably a legitimate full 40 hr work week worth of work if you were to finish the job completely. Between my kids destruction, my wife's lack of support, and my own ADHD instincts to not see through large tasks, I just can't get it done. I don't think I have gotten more than 3 rooms done in the past 5 years before losing focus or giving up and then it gets immediately trashed very quickly as if I did nothing and we are back to looking like horder wannabees. Point being though, I KNOW that if nothing else, if I could just have a clean house that stayed clean for say a month or two, I KNOW it would have a significant impact on the mental health in this house. We have 2 ADHD kids and ADHD dad who can never find anything because every room has infinity things laying around so you cant find anything and lose stuff every day. And I know is one of the significant factors in my our marriage at this point. But she won't lift a finger to do anything about it, and im so broken at this point I'm not sure if I am even capable of seeing the job fully through to completion. I have said I would for 5 years and havent succeeded yet. Not once. Not even close. I think best I ever did was 6 out of 10 rooms. It such a simple task. Hell my 8 yr old got a wild hair today because he realized he could make some money and cleaned 70% of the biggest room in the house. It took him probably 4 hours straight, but he did a great job and I could probably finish the job with another 30 min of work. Point being, it is such a solvable problem, but this woman broke me so thoroughly I can't even pull it together to get that done at this point even though I know how much good it would do.\n\nOn some level, I'm proud of myself of taking one for the team and keeping this family alive. But this cost has been way more than I ever understood going in to this. It would be so easy to walk away. But I can't. She has showed her hand in subtle ways enough times, I have unfortunately figured out she doesn't actually hate me. I definitely wouldn't describe her as \"in love with me\", but I know there is still love there. It is just hiding under a pile of depression, manifested physically and mentally. You could argue I should leave for the kids, the house in particular being evidense for it, but for selfish reasons I don't want that. I don't think I could survive not living with my children and I am not confident I would get custody, and I absolutely don't trust her when she swears she would magically all of a sudden start doing all the things I do to make the house/family run. She thinks she can divorce me, and then her life will be fixed instantly and she will start doing things again and be able to do all the things necessary. I can't trust that will be the case. And also I have never managed to actually hate her. I kind of wish I did on some level, because that would allow me to walk away. The reality is, if she would allow it to be the case, our household could look like we just fell in love yesterday if only there was a second willing participant. She has cheated on me, but even worse just throughly broken my spirit, and yet still I would look past all of that in an instant if she could just find a way to open up her heart to me again. This woman hold grudges forever, but for me all it would take would be a single honest heart felt \"I love you\" and I would happily let go years of the hateful, mean, vile shit that has been slung my way. I'm a simple man. I just want to be loved. I have loved this woman through it all. Whether by choice or because my heart just can't let go, I have always loved her. But in 5 years, I have heard I love you from that woman 1 time. One single time. Brought back her favorite icecream on a plane for XMAS using dry ice, and the gesture caught her off guard and I got a genuine legitimite I love you off the deal. But fuck, if I have to go another 5 years to get the next \"I love you\"..... I'm just not built for that. I would rather amputate a limb than go that long again without hearing those words. I need it. It's like air to me and I am suffocating.\n\nTLDR: Living in a loveless marriage for 5 years because I thought I could ride out my wife's depression.  It turns out untreated depression mixed with a rocky marriage don't just magically fix themselves with time.   LIving with someone that is depressed and \"hates you\" appears to be an easy road to becoming depressed yourself.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Her advances have been incredibly bold and confident, so much to the point that I’m convinced she will coerce me if im alone in a room with her. Via social media she has made bold statements like “time for your love”, and when delays got in the way of me arriving to their family’s geographical location she’s made statements like “where were you” along side a picture with seductive eyes while in heels. Basically she talks to me like she’s my woman, which leads me to believe she wanted more than a one night stand, she wants to be my side piece in secrecy. I believe she’s naturally a manipulative brat, and I say this because she’s very attractive (I rate her an 8.5 out of 10) so she’s probably used to getting her way with men. But with me I did not hesitate to reject her proposal as my loyalty belongs to my wife alone. This upset her aunt and probably took a toll on her ego. This aunt began to subtweet me in the most vicious ways, by exaggerating my flaws and shortcomings and trying to subtly convince the family that I might not be trust worthy, ultimately an attempt to sabotage my marriage. I believe she’s trying to “punish” me for not letting her have me. She also might feel envious of my wife (her niece) and probably doesn’t want her to have me. Very recently I discovered that news got out and her behavior was exposed. I honestly wanted to talk to her one on one and say “hey it’s not you, I’m simply just honoring my marriage, let’s move forward as a family in the right direction and we’ll leave this behind us.” The reason is, I didn’t want to potentially hurt my wife from family betrayal. But it’s too late for that, and the aunt seems to be in hiding now, she hasn’t been on social media since news got out. I also haven’t spoken with my fiancée since. Anyways, I would like to ask for advice: when I meet the family in person for the first time, should I expect the aunt to not be present? And if she is, how do I manage the awkwardness?

She also pushes away arguments when i want to speak to her about problems.\nRecently shes been texted by a flirt whos known to be a bad person and when i described my concern she threw an upset and didnt awnser me at all leading to us arguing.

We met about a year ago through mutual friends at which time i was in a long term relationship. We became good friends and after my ex and I split up we began talking as slightly more than friends. \n\nWhile we were still in the talking stage, I unfortunately continued to talk to my ex and was hanging out with her as well as I was struggling with my feelings after breaking up. During this awkward stage, my current girlfriend ended up having a one night stand with someone who I have been friends with for a long time who she met through me. This really upsets me because she was aware that we were friends but I feel like I have no reason to be upset considering I was still actively talking to and hooking up with my ex. After some time apart, we ended up talking again after meeting up through a mutual friend. \n\nSince then, we have been dating exclusively for a few months with no issues and she has been an incredible girlfriend. However, I cannot seem to get over the fact that she hooked up with my friend. I can say that she was not aware about the extent of our friendship when they hooked up and has been completely honest and up front with me about the whole situation since the beginning.

{"id": "u/Different-Floor-6882_1637", "user": "u/Different-Floor-6882", "text": "Struggling with insecurity and trust. How can I move forward?\n\nHey everyone. This is my first time posting here and honestly the first time I’ve really opened up and asked for advice about something this personal, so I’d really appreciate any thoughts or feedback.\n\nI’m 19F and have been with my boyfriend 20M for about 3 years. Overall, he’s always been kind, respectful, and supportive. For the most part, I’ve felt secure in our relationship. But lately, my insecurities have been getting the best of me, and it’s caused a lot of issues, mostly with trust.\n\nA few months ago, I made the mistake of going through his phone. I know it was wrong, and I take full responsibility for that, but I had a gut feeling something was off. He wasn’t cheating, but I found that he had been messaging his friends’ girlfriends and deleting the messages. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal since they’re all part of a big friend group, but the fact that he was hiding it really bothered me.\n\nThat moment kind of broke my trust. I tried to move past it and give him the benefit of the doubt, but a couple months later, I looked again (I know, I know and I regret it), and I found he had been talking to another girl since the beginning of our relationship. It was a platonic friendship, but I had no idea she even existed. They texted often. sometimes daily and he confided in her about a lot of things, especially about our relationship and his feelings. Things he never shared with me.\n\nWhen I asked him about it, he told me he avoids telling me certain things because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He’s never once gotten angry with me, and in his eyes, he sees me as someone who can do no wrong. But I don’t want to be put on a pedestal.\nI want honest communication, even when it’s uncomfortable. Because hiding things to protect my feelings still ends up hurting me.\n\nTo his credit, he’s really been trying to prove he can do better since all of this happened. He’s been more present, more reassuring, and I can see the effort he’s making. But communication is still a struggle. I don’t want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells or be afraid to talk to me honestly. That’s not the kind of relationship I want.\n\nAt the same time, I’m trying to hold myself accountable too. I know this isn’t all on him but it’s not all on me either. I’ve struggled with insecurity for most of my life, and I think that’s made it harder for him to feel safe opening up. Sometimes I feel like I was the one who made him feel like he had to hide things, and that’s a really painful realization.\n\nOn top of that, I’ve also been feeling really conflicted because all of his friends and family seem to think I’ve been completely irrational. They’ve said it’s totally normal to have friends of the opposite sex, and that it’s actually weird not to. They’ve even told him he should break up with me, and that going through each other’s phones is toxic and unhealthy. And while I understand where they’re coming from, it’s made me second-guess everything, everyone of my boundaries.\n\nI’ve started to wonder if I really did go too far. I feel guilty, even though what he did felt like a big betrayal to me maybe it just hit a personal nerve because of how insecure I already was. It’s hard not to internalize all of it and feel like I’m the problem.\n\nWhat I want more than anything is to feel secure in myself. I want to stop feeling like I’m not “enough,” or that I’m ruining something good just because I’m afraid of getting hurt. I want to be able to trust him without overthinking everything, and I want to be someone he feels comfortable being real with.\n\nSo how do I start working on this? How do I rebuild my confidence and trust without ignoring the things that hurt me and without making him feel like he has to hold back? \n\nThanks in advance to anyone who read all this. I’m also totally open to giving more context or answering questions if anything is unclear or you want more details.\n\nTL;DR:\nI (19F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for 3 years. He’s kind and supportive, but my insecurities have caused trust issues especially after finding out he was hiding conversations with other girls, including one close friend he never told me about. He’s made a real effort to rebuild trust, but I still struggle with doubt and resentment. His friends and family think I’m being irrational and even told him to break up with me, which has made me feel worse. I just want to feel secure in myself, rebuild trust, and learn how to move forward in a healthy way for both of us.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We have been through a lot together and as you can guess from our ages we have grown and changed a lot as well.\n\nFor the past year I have had this gnawing thought in my head that I am in the wrong relationship with the wrong partner and maybe there are 2 people out there that are better for the both of us. I have OCD so I largely have attributed my anxieties and obsessions about our relationship to this.\n\nWe mostly don't have any glaring issues. We laugh together with our little inside jokes and we are living in a relatively small apartment together with little to no fighting. We equally contribute to the cooking, cleaning (we are both OCD lol), and general upkeep of our home. We share many of the same political and religious views and generally hold the same values. She is very understanding and compassionate, especially towards my mental illness problems. We trust each other whole heartedly. She gives me the ocassional thoughtful gift and well-writen card for no other reason other than to say \"I love you\" (something I could get better at reciprocating myself).\n\nBut it isn't all perfect, our sex life has seriously taken a hit. We have sex maybe 2 times a month and she has openly said that sex isn't important to her and would be fine if we stopped. It feels like she only agrees to have sex because its been long enough and feels obligated which is such a gross feeling.\n\nIt feels like our conversations lack any real depth. Part of this is not having the time to bond like we used to as we are so busy with school and work. But, (and I know I am about to sound like the most conceited person in the world here) there feels like an intelligence gap between us. I am interested in discussing politics with others in a constructive way that deepens my understanding of certain topics. I like to spend my free time learning a second language, or creating a new software application (I do this for a living), or reading for the sake of learning about something. Considering this, it feels like after 6 years our conversations have become increasingly dull. But maybe I should expect this after such a long time.\n\nWe don't share many hobbies. I like to run, go to the gym, play video games, read non-fiction, party with friends, learn/study new things, woodwork, work with electronics. She doesn't relate to any of these things. We can't even find a movie or show we both like 90% of the time.\n\nShe doesn't have much interest in these things and the deeper issue is that she doesn't have a real interest in anything. She just likes to play on her phone all day or watch reality TV which feels like such a huge disconnect from my pursuits in life. I want to always try to be a better, more fit, more knowledgeable, kinder person tomorrow than today. But she doesn't have a drive to do anything. She is even telling me that she wants to drop out of her masters program and just work at the local grocery store, which is selling herself so short.\n\nI feel so guilty writing these past few paragraphs because it feels like I am complaining to the internet about someone I love so much. It comes off a some bitter old man who hates his nagging wife. She deserves so much better than that.\n\nWanting to break up feels like the most non-sensical thing. Because why do I want to break up with someone when there isn't some massive fight or glaringly large issue. It just feels like I am no longer happy. But then again, maybe I am just unhappy myself, separate of our relationship.\n\nOne big thing that has stuck in my head is that I am potentially falling into the fallacy of the grass being green on the other side. Maybe it is expected for your sex life to fall off after 6 years, or to not share many interests, or not be with someone as goal driven or hyper focused on self betterment. I feel like I have such an ego for expecting so much. This is my first relationship and I sorely like a frame of reference.\n\n  \nTL;DR - I feel like my gf and I lack common interests, have grown apart, and have a failing sex life.

We do not live together. A few months ago, right after she started a new job, she mentioned randomly on a phone call that she had met a really cool guy (30's M) at work. I was happy that she had made a friend at her new job and that was that. The next day he came up in conversation again. I heard about him a third day in a row and saw she had been texting with him on Instagram as she was doing it while sitting next to me on the couch and the text bubbles looked to be large. It was during this time that I had felt our texting, mainly on her side, had become stale and brief.\n\nThe frequent mentions of him and the reduction in our texting concerned me so I expressed that I was uncomfortable with this new friendship and the level of friendly communication they seemed to be engaging in outside of work while our texting seemed to be faltering. She apologized and immediately expressed this to her coworker and that she needed to tone texting down and she did. I did not ask her to do that but appreciated it and felt it was the best response. I don't have a problem with her having male friends. She has multiple male friends from before we were dating that I know and have no problem with her communicating with or being around though to date she has only hung out with them at the same time as me. I haven't set things up that way for the record.\n\nHe has come up multiple times in discussions and I am told that he's a friend and nothing more. However, they seem to be texting throughout the day and she texts him even when we're supposed to be on a date together. I never hear about any of her other male friends anymore, only him. Sometimes he is mentioned in conjunction with another work friend who is a 40's F. I do think men and women can be friends but I don't know many men that will text a woman all the time that he doesn't have some level of interest in. She said she talks about me all the time and he is  well aware of me.\n\nTwo weeks ago I told her I was on my way to checking out due to this new friendship and the fact that she never wants to go on dates and instead prefers to stay in which we've discussed multiple times. She apologized but didn't really explain why she went back on limiting communication. We've had two dates since where she texted him during the first and facetimed him during the second to show him what we were doing. I consider this disrespectful unless of course its an emergency and would be bothered regardless of who she was texting. It hurt more since we had discussed phone usage on dates a week before this. To me a date is a time in which two people prioritize each other. I expressed my displeasure again with this and she apologized again.\n\nIn my view, my gf is the most important non-relative woman in my life and I prioritize my relationship with her over that of other women within reason. I am still friendly and cordial but I could not imagine texting a female coworker in the same manner she has been texting hers. She described this view as old fashioned and said she used to hold it but now sees what she's doing as okay because they're just friends and she only loves me. She says that my discomfort makes her feel like I don't trust her. I do trust her, I just don't think I should have to compete against another man for her attention on dates or when we're hanging out. To me, frequently texting someone of the opposite sex much like her and I did early on is a way to invite unintentional feelings and therefore disrespectful to the relationship.\n\nI feel as though my concerns are being dismissed and she's prioritizing this friendship of 2 months over our relationship of 12 months.\n\nIs there a way back from this or is the relationship already over due to this being a fundamental incompatibility?\n\nTLDR: Gf texts new male coworker friend of 2 months frequently during our dates and time together despite me expressing discomfort over the situation and I feel my concerns are dismissed affecting out 1 year relationship.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

He got laid off from his job and hasn’t been able to find anything new since. He promises me that he is applying every day, but I am starting to question if that’s the truth or not. I’m currently in graduate school as well as working my part time job (15-20 hours a week), so I usually sleep 11PM till around 8 or 9AM. Our bedroom is set up with our bed and both of our pcs, we are both very into gaming. Every morning I wake up, I hear my boyfriend on his computer laughing and joking with his friends on an online game. I’ll yell over a “good morning” from our bed two to three times until he eventually acknowledges me and says “good morning, mi amor” and he goes straight back to his game. I usually lay in bed on my phone expecting him to come crawl into bed with me and spend time with me before I start my own busy day. Eventually I get out of bed to get ready for the day and that’s when he gets off and comes to bed, and begs me to lay in bed and cuddle him until he falls asleep.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend stays awake from about 6pm until 9am and sleeps the entire day. And it’s starting to impact how I view our relationship. I’m starting to resent that I work and go to school and spend most of my day working towards our future, and he doesn’t even go to sleep with me at night, in our home and bed, that I’m working so hard to keep for us. I cook every day for myself, and he eats whatever is left over, and I clean on my days off. What makes it worse is that I don’t necessarily like his friends that he is playing with all night. It’s a new group of friends he met about three months ago on the game. Lots of girls get involved in the group of friends and they always end up flirting with him or straight up shit talk me because they like him. He always rejects their advances, tells them off, and blocks them, but it just has ignited such an anxiety in me that he’s constantly surrounded by people disrespecting me and my relationship. I’ve brought this up to him before and he simply told me he loved me and he would never leave or cheat on me.

He’s my best friend, and I didn’t know I could feel this lonely while being with the man I’m supposed to one day marry. And all of this started once he got laid off and started playing this god awful game. It’s like he has become addicted to it and can no longer recognize that we are living real life right now. Like he forgets he has a life outside of being online. And I get being addicted to a game. I’m a gamer as well, but I would never prioritize a game over my partner. How do I have this conversation with him? I don’t want to start an argument and I really don’t want to break up with him.

{"id": "u/MegaYap_1643", "user": "u/MegaYap", "text": "Should I (23M) end things with my boyfriend (27M)?\n\nThis is probably going to be extremely long, so I apologize. I’ve also never really posted on Reddit before (minus asking a similar question that I immediately deleted), so I’m not sure the proper way to do this. \n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for four years. We’ve had plenty of ups and downs, but mostly our relationship is fine — in the sense that we generally don’t fight and we both genuinely love each other. \n\nHere’s the big thing though: he cheated three years ago. \n\nThe first year of our relationship was incredible. \n\nWe both met each other in pretty volatile times in our lives. I had been in a toxic relationship with a woman about four months before we met. My ex dumped me after repeated cheating (that I wasn’t aware of until after my relationship ended), lied about pretty intense drug use, was in constant communication with her ex, and overall just used any opportunity to make me feel horrible about myself. I was really at an all-time low … and then I met him. \n\nHe had ended a long-term relationship after finding out his ex he lived with had cheated on him. Before that relationship, he was married to a woman fresh out of high school who also cheated on him. \n\nWe met on a dating app, just planned to hook up one time, and ended up falling in love. I wanted to be around him all the time — he made me feel so good about myself, which was something I hadn’t felt in a long time. He was so supportive, and I truly felt how much he cared about me.\n\nWhen we met, he was going through a period of self-discovery, and he literally came out as trans (FTM) the day we met. I had previously identified as gay, but things with me and him just clicked. I was there through every step of the way at the beginning of his transition, from his first shot of testosterone, to legally changing his name and gender marker. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship, there was a drastic change. I felt him start to push me away. He didn’t want to see me as often, and I started to feel similarly to how I had in my previous relationship. He asked to take a break, which I respected. He wanted me to go to therapy, which I did. \n\nAfter having gone through what I had the year before, and thinking about how well he treated me for so long, I was desperate to keep him. I was there at his beck and call when he wanted me, and I stayed away when he didn’t. I was willing to do anything he wanted, even when he made me feel like an afterthought. \n\nWe had a very short-lived official breakup. For just a few weeks, he told me he had had enough and we didn’t see each other, but we still talked every day. During this time, I was interning at a big insurance firm in my city, which hosted events for the interns. One night I was getting ready for one of these events when he asked me to skip and get dinner with him instead, which I did. That night, he said he wanted to try things again, and I said that he couldn’t just toy around with me anymore, and from there on out, he didn’t. He was back to his caring, supportive self. \n\nBut I asked if he had slept with anyone else during this time, and he told me no. \n\nOne year later, we were on vacation with my grandparents, and after a night out, he got too drunk and was sick in the bathroom. While I was grabbing his phone for him, I saw a cute message from one of his friends. I opened his phone (we’ve always shared passwords, but I had never snooped because I didn’t think I had a reason to), and I saw that he had been gushing about me. Wanting to see what else he had said, I searched my name in his iMessage, and that’s when I saw a text that said, “I’ve never cheated before, if you can call what I did to [my name] cheating.” \n\nThen, I read through messages between him and a friend where he was talking in graphic detail about sleeping with someone else. The messages were from months after our break, but it made it clear that this situation had happened when we were on our short-term breakup. \n\nI was obviously devastated, but when I asked him about it, he was honest. He told me everything and he answered all my questions when I asked. I was heartbroken, but he was adamant that he didn’t cheat because we technically weren’t together at the time. I definitely felt like he HAD cheated, especially since I had asked if anything happened the night we got back together, and he lied. He also had all the time in the world to tell me about it in the year after it happened, but he never did. \n\nI stayed though, because at the time he needed me. He was having top surgery in a few weeks, which required pretty intensive caregiving, and he needed me to watch his dog. Over time, I grew to forgive him, but the feelings never went away. \n\nAfter that, I started to notice how often he put me in situations that I wasn’t entirely comfortable in. He wanted to move in together when I was still in an active lease with my college roommates. When I said I didn’t want to pay two rents, he told me he had “nowhere else to go” despite living with a friend who owned their home. He started distancing himself from my friends, stopped attending family events with me, and stopped caring about anniversaries and birthdays. \n\nI was upset by this, and after about a year of living together, I thought about ending our relationship and moving out on my own. He found these messages, and when confronted, I folded because I hated the idea of losing him. In that time, we signed another lease and moved into the place we’re at now, which brings me to today. \n\nMy thoughts about the cheating, living alone, and his distance haven’t gone away. He has been putting more of an effort into showing up for me, and our relationship has been genuinely good for the last year or so. However, my friends hate him and not so subtly encourage me to leave him. \n\nOur deadline to resign the lease is at the end of the month (our lease is not up for another 60 days, however), and I’ve been thinking about moving out yet again. I brought this up with him, which obviously wasn’t received well on his part, and we’ve been spending the last few days separate.\n\nHe wants to see a couples’ counselor, which we are doing tomorrow (at the time I’m writing this), and he’s told me how much he wants to make this relationship work, how hard this distance has been, and how he can’t imagine his life without me in it. \n\nThe distance is hard for me too, and honestly, I just want to make things work. But now, my family knows what’s been going on, and my friends are ready for me to move on, but I feel so torn. I don’t want to alienate myself from my support system by going back, and I don’t want to recommit to another year if my feelings continue to stay the same. On the other hand, I’m finding it hard to let go of our relationship — the 95% of it that’s good. I know he would never cheat again, and I know how much he loves me — and I love him. \n\nSo, should I stay or go? \n\nObviously, that’s a decision that’s only for me to make, but we’re cutting it close on time, and I want to hear different opinions from non-involved third parties who can look at the situation objectively. \n\nTL;DR: \n\nMy partner and I have been together for four years. I’m looking for advice as to whether I should end things after he potentially cheated while on a break (which he did not disclose) one year into our relationship.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I want to stay with him.\n\n\nHi. i’m writing this post because yesterday I found out my boyfriend was flirting with a girl behind my back. he reassured me so many times that he wasn’t but i found out that he was flirtaciously bantering with another girl and calling her cute and sexy. \n\nI know a lot of people will tell me that i should leave him probably but i’m choosing to stay with him. we’ve been together for 7 months and were talking for about a 6 months. we’re long distance- we met online and we met 3 times since dating. he surprised me on my birthday despite him being broke. \n\nwhen we first met we were both jobless and depressed. for the most part, we’ve helped and encouraged eachother to be the best people we could be. we had A LOT of ups and downs but we were getting through that. Even though we helped eachother with some things- there are still a lot of unresolved issues with my boyfriend and i suppose it lead to him unconsciouslly flirting with another girl. \n\nI read that someone can love their partner so much but still end up cheating. sometimes it’s need for validation or things like unresolved problems. \n\nWhen i found out that he was flirting with another girl i broke up with him. it didn’t last long though. i yelled at him, i was mean to him and he just took it cause he knew what he did wrong. I didn’t want to throw away what we had worked hard to build- our relationship, the understandings we had of eachother and the secrets we only know aboht eachother. He’s the first person i’ve ever opened up to - thus allowing him to help me with the traumas that led my life. \n\nI decided to talk to him about it after a few hours and he said he doesn’t know why he did that. it went over his head. he didn’t send or receieve photos- they didn’t talk about sex or anything but he reffered to a photo she sent from their past and called it sexy. it hurts to know he did this. he says he doesn’t know why he did this. He is a good guy but sometimes he’s just too nice. too friendly. he doesn’t know how to set boundaries - which is what led him to do this. \n\nhe’s expressed his regret and is always apologizing. i understand that he didn’t know what he was doing and that a part of him just doesn’t care about a lot of things so when he did this- he wasn’t really thinking. he struggles with a part of him that just doesn’t care about anything sometimes- even though he cares aboht me- hes just mindless. i do/did hold that against him, though. He apologies and says hes gonna try to figure out that part of him he doesn’t understand and that he’s going to try to get therapy. i’m going to help him find a therapist- he doesn’t know how to but i know where to look, generally. \n\nI understand his regret and guilt and apologies. i understand unresolved trauma may have caused this but it doesn’t change that fact that i feel like i’ve been cheated and betrayed. i have trust issues and he is well-aware of this. he reassured me and we had many fights because of my overthinking. i was just starting to trust him until he pulled this. it feels like a year of progress to fully start trusting him has been washed down the drain. as if all my efforts to do better were nothing. i used to think i was the one who had a lot of things to work on but here he is- pulling this crap. \n\nit only happened yesterday. We hangout and then randomly i think about this and i start talking about how sad and hurt i am. he apologizes but then i start talking more and more on how he hurt me and i just get angry and i say petty stuff and he gets sad. he just listens, though and takes it. he says he just takes it cause he knows he did wrong. he says he’s lucky that i even stayed and that he will show me and do better. \n\ni want to be with him but how do we get past this? I don’t want us to break because we are both sad. how do we get through this? I don’t really know what to do. I feel bad when he gets sad that i’m sad because i know he regrets doing this and that he really didn’t mean to but at the same time he’s the one who lied to me and betrayed me. \n\nTLDR: i found out my boyfriend was flirting with another girl behind my back. i want to stay with him but how do we proceed?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

For the most part they have been happy and we’ve got on really well.)\n\nThank you to everyone who commented. We had a few chats in the week after the original post about the situation. I explained how her going behind my back plus dwelling on this past relationship made me feel.\n\nShe had said if I didn't want her to speak to him anymore, she wouldn't - I was adamant that this wasn't my call to make. She eventually said that she wouldn't speak to him anymore and that she was naïve to think that her and her ex could still be friends. As far as I was aware, she let him know that she wouldn't be in contact anymore because of me and he was accepting of this (I haven't seen any of their messages nor have I asked to).\n\nA week later my mother passed away so a pin was stuck in any conversations between us but about a week ago we had a good chat in which I felt heard, mostly centring around me creating a larger social life outside the home and how we've become co-dependent on each other. I said that my trust in her has been eroded which upset her a little but she understood. We seemed to be getting back on track and I was open about my insecurities, and what I needed to work on.\n\nUnfortunately a few days later, she seemed distracted and when I asked her what was wrong, she said she'd tell me later when the kids are in bed. This was dragged out all day and then she admitted that she was still in contact with her ex for a couple of weeks and wants to meet him for coffee. I asked what would happen if he made a move, and she said she'd be \"disappointed\". I also asked about his wife, and apparently he's separated (which she knew about before but didn't tell me). He's embarking on a new career and was asking her for advice, to which I questioned was there not anyone else in his life that could provide career advice. She also says he's had a cancer scare which also prompted her to get in touch with him again.\n\nIt's her call who she meets up with but I told her the lying has to stop. She claims it's so she doesn't hurt me but it's caused more damage by lying. She admitted that making me decide about her not talking to him anymore was \"poor\" but that I don't understand the depth of feeling that existed between them.\n\nI don't know what to say to her and have started investigating what steps to take legally to protect myself. I'm so angry and sad, that at best, she is sacrificing a 15-year marriage to be friends with an ex she hasn't seen in 20 years, and at worst, will get back with him.

I’m getting very anxious about his depression and almost am worried that me coming to visit him is going to put him in a dark spot. He’s already so home sick and super stressed from his work.

[16M & 15F]\n\nUpdate to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/s/FzIAb78Ud8\n\nPosting this again because I accidentally messed up the text order 😭\n\nWhat she said: \n\nyep, i do want to break up. but before that let me just let you know about my feelings which i wasn’t able to communicate before. maybe they don’t matter now, but let’s just do it. so basically, why i want to break up might not be valid, but i’m pretty sure it will result in us getting less hurt. yes, it might be a permanent heartbreak, but i’m sure we’ll heal.\n\nso it’s because i want to stop both of us from being hurt. another way was changing myself, which, realistically speaking, i just can’t. i did reflect on the things you said about me, like how the things i do are red flags, that i don’t prioritize, manipulate, don’t speak about my feelings, and stuff like that. you also mentioned i’m emotionally immature which alright, i’ll take all that. i did mind you saying that to me because i would never do that, but hey, we both are different and that’s totally okay.\n\nnow all of these are points that i’m keeping in my head and will try to improve myself for basically myself. i didn’t realize i was all that, but now that i’m self-aware, i’ll try my best to make myself better.\n\nwith that, i know both of us felt like we’re caged. i felt like i didn’t have any free will to do anything, and everything felt extremely controlling and toxic. it also shattered me to the core when you said that me not being able to open up easily and being uncomfortable is a “skill issue,” which i don’t know if you’re aware of, but it’s low key messed up to say something like that to someone, but anyway, that’s on you.\n\neven though i forgave you for raising your voice at me, it really is a lesson for me because you did say you’d be gentle with me, as that was the only thing i wanted from you. i understand you got frustrated, but genuinely think, if you were in my place, would you not choose someone gentle over everything?\n\ni’m sorry for being hard to communicate with and for the stress i’ve caused you. with that, you’ve always stopped me from interacting with everyone, and yeah, you’re going to think that what you were doing was right for me. it might be or might not, but it was still strange.\n\nthere were a lot of things that bothered me too, but i didn’t talk about it at the time so i forgot. and yes, i did know you were not okay with the “protecting myself” thing, but it was just for my own self so i wouldn’t get hurt easily. it did work well. you would say i don’t care, but it really is about that. after that argument everything felt so different that i had to do this. it did save me from caring about every single detail and overthinking about it. it’ll also help me move on easily, and i think it’s something positive.\n\ni did care and love you, and it was always genuine. even when you used to doubt, assume, or criticize me on stuff, i still did and all of it was real. so if you thought it was fake, well, it never was and that’s a promise. sometimes i did feel like the love i’m showing you might be a waste because at the end you’re going to say it’s fake, but anyway, it’s never a waste whether it’s appreciated or not.\n\nall of that is fine. again, i’m sorry for the damage i’ve done. so yep, that’s about it. i still have to leave, even if things get fixed or not. so that’s about what was on my side.\n\n\nWhat I said: \n\nalright thanks for letting me know. as i predicted, there are a bunch of misunderstandings in this too. even though theres no point in explaining right now, i still will. and \"i'll still leave even if we fix things\" doesnt make sense since theres no actual reason to leave then but anyways thats your preference. \n\nso again, breaking up is just wasting what we have when we can make each other \"heal\" in a more positive way. i already explained this before, and its self explanatory. the things i said about you, how some things you do are red flags, you're emotionally immature, and all that, i said it so you could realise and change that stuff about yourself for us, because i care about you. i never meant it in a discriminatory way, again, it was to help you realise. because in a relationship, the couple is supposed to change each other to be compatible and they will if they truly love each other, thats how love works. and yeah, you can take this as a lesson to improve yourself, not for \"myself\" though, but for the next person you date. because your points are 100% valid and you have every right to do what you want. these things that me and you have talked about are only necessary in relationships, because both partners have equal rights and are supposed to work together. \n\ni get how everything felt controlling and you felt trapped. but you wouldn't have if you realised why i did what i did. if i left you to he with my female friend who liked me and tried to make us break up, you would have taken it way differently, realistically. and i dont remember saying the \"skill issue\" thing, and i would never say that. but if i did, it was obviously not meant in that direction. i probably meant to say that it means you just need to improve the skill or whatever.\n\nand yeah, i would want someone to be gentle with me. but i dont think i would expect them to be gentle all the time, especially if i dont communicate with them and make them frustrated. so yeah being frustrated and sometimes mad in a situation like this is perfectly normal in my opinion. i never stopped you from interacting with everyone. i stopped you from interacting with red flag guys who are a danger to us. if we didnt deal with the other guy a few months ago, this exact thing would have happened that time, i know very well, and i predicted this. and no i didnt do it because its good for \"you\" i did it because it was good for \"us\" and the protecting myself thing is extremely wrong lol. it shows you never cared about how i felt since the start. and yes it is indeed selfish. if you wanted to not be attached, you should have just broken up then, why waste my time. and again, breaking up is NOT positive lol, especially when we have an option to fix it and prevent stuff like this from happening in the future. but khair everyone has their own preferences. for you, you like to micro cheat in relationships and have extremely wrong relations with guys, so understandable that we both may not allign.\n\nand yes i did doubt your love, and i still do. because what you did to me and what you're doing RIGHT NOW proves your love was always uneven. leaving me for a guy who disrespects us and who likes you. its obvious what your intentions are lol, im not dumb. anyways thats on you and what you want to do. but again, it lowkey pisses me off how you think this is the right thing to do instead of again, fixing things. tbh, love never works like this. at ALL. because arguments are normal. and if you can't handle one and aren't willing to fix one, then im afraid you'll just keep breaking up with people i guess. i don't know if you will even date anyone or not but doesnt matter. \n\nthanks for letting me know about all this now. tbh you should have said all this before so i could explain and again, maybe actually fix this. since these are all misunderstanding, or shifted mindset stuff. but yeah anyways i'll always value our relationship and what we had. thanks again for opening up.\n\nHer points seemed really invalid to me, and most of them were misunderstandings she kept in her mind. \n\nThanks again to everyone who supported in the previous post. You all helped me get the motivation to stand up and do the right thing. This was extremely hard for me, and it feels like i've lost a piece of my life, because i genuinely loved her a lot, and invested so much time and energy in her.. and we planned our future together, our marriage, our university, everything. but this made me learn my lesson: always set boundaries before dating. We both are in an online school where we students have no way of talking to each other, but we both were able to meet by a miracle and she was the only one i knew who was in my class. So now it feels really empty and lonely without even an academic partner, my birthday is also coming up in a week, and she had so much stuff planned for me, and we have lots of stuff to share with each other, so doing this at this time especially hurt a lot.. but hey it was for the best. \n\nThank you again!", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Mind you, I live in EU, I do also understand one can grow and follow ones dreams even within the relationship but we are long distance.\n\nI will start with my relationship. He is wonderful and I love him so much..like he is the love of my life, I want it to be him and no one else kind of love. But some things happened between us which made me lose trust in him for quite some time which resulted in some trials in our relationship, we communicated healthily and he has shown progress and so have I.\n\nThe thing is though we are in a long distance relationship and he wants me to move across the world to live with him and he doesn't want to part from his family and the work he has at the moment and while we had our bad time, I started to grieve over him and our relationship and tried to focus on my initial plan which is going to another country and build my career there.\n\nLately I've been looking up videos on how to move to that country and how to plan for it in the best way possible. This country is my old home and I have always wanted to go back and settle there but I also want to stay with him. I want to grow old with him and build our life together, he said it might take awhile before I can move in with him (at least 3 years or more)  because he wants to save up to buy land with his family and build multiple houses with them. I would be past 30 when the time comes\n\nThe love he has for the family is wonderful and they love me as well. He wants me to properly meet all of his important family members before we get engaged and that could take a while too. I've talked to him about this dream and we've discussed it, he wanted me to wait. So at the time I compromised and said okay, I will wait but it somehow feels weird. I feel a bit crazy for being upset not going to lie..haha.\n\nI mean the country he lives in is not really a country I want to be in but it's where he is at and I want to be where he is but I also want to pursue my dream.\n\nSo what should I do? Should I put away my dreams and trust that we will be okay and support him, should I step away even if it hurts to pursue my dreams or is there anything in between?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We had never met irl. I'll spare the details but we've had an amazing relationship and were extremely lovey dovey from start until june where a few turn of events almost tore us appart and we've been trying to hold it together, here's what's going on\n\nOn her side, something I've known prior to the relationship is that she has a genetic disorder that greatly affects her immune system. She has been diagnosed hypersomniac a week ago. Both these factors make her unable to work and it is a big weight on her, and it forces her to live with her mom. Back in june she took custody of her little sister, they do not share the same mother but she now also lives at my gf's mom. And towards the start of august one of her best friend passed away, she does not have much time to herself to properly mourn her. This is a lot for her to take as it has been for me because it prevents us from meeting like we thought at the start of the relationship. I wish she would express more how she is doing but most of the time she just holds it in and explodes when I make the wrong step.\n\nMeanwhile me I have a FT job so during the day it's very difficult to keep contact, I try very hard with messages but she has not been receptive to those and prefer voice which I can't access unless I have a break. That sounds alright on paper, but it really weights me that the communication during the day is so difficult and how little time we have during the evening to connect which also have obstacles which are mostly she taking care of her sister, and activities that include me, myself and some friends (I don't feel connected to my partner when there's too many people around). Also, despite my choice to pursue this carrier I don't see myself growing in my field, I want to change but I'm very hesitant to take the first step because I have no idea what to do. I could say more if I think about it but to sum it up : I'm being very pessimistic about anything. To top it all of I would say I'm socially awkward and I struggle to have confrontation, I usually will take personnaly any reproach and it will get stuck to me for way too much time and yk when I feel like I take the right step, suddenly I'll fuck up and go back 100 step. I might be selfish in a sense but after a 9h workday it's been hard to keep up. I could make an expose of what I think about myself and it would be veryy negative. I tried therapy but I don't think I engaged in the right topics and would go again.\n\n  \nI really really really don't want to end this relationship, she has been a shining light when I was alone and has helped me going through life. I want to better myself for her and for me, but I'm struggling. Any advice could help and I'm free to discuss.

Advice is appreciated\n\nWe started talking from June 2023, he emotionally cheated from June 2023 - May 2024.\n\nApparently his girl bestfriend enjoyed his attention so she led him on from March 2022 - May 2024. (He made me believe we were exclusive)\n\nI only got to know in April 2024 as he confessed that he and that girl stopped talking in February 2024, as he slowly started falling for me.\n\nI confronted this girl to know the truth, because girls support girls right? She was an old friend in 2017 so I thought that'll also rekindle an old friendship. Turns out this girl was two-faced. Instead of telling me the truth, and questioning him normally she did this \"testing\" and \"games\". Don't need such a friend, seems very malicious. She called him and asked him to date her instead, knowing the fact that we are dating, lied about me flirting with another guy, likely because for her ego she wanted to show that she can get him, but he blocked her. She said she did it to \"TEST HIS LOYALTY\", which is of course false.\n\nI gave this guy another chance which is yet again a bad move, disrespects every 2 weeks from June 2024 - June 2025. Trust eventually got better as he was at home alone with his mom, by May 2025 I trusted him completely, we were so happy together till July 2025. \n\nHe started masters in August 2025 and secretly made female friends without even being transparent. He should've told me immediately but he told me after 2-3 weeks. He went on trips with them. \n\nHe told me he will text the girls in his class and then show me a screenshot to prove that it's purely platonic. Why start text conversations with them if they didn't start conversations yet? I was angry and he blamed my reaction.\n\nDue to the secrecy and trust issues I couldn't be \"sweet\" to him, I was still responding like a friend would (not calling him babe or using heart emojis) but he blamed me for being nonchalant and cold. I am not someone who can fake it. Trust takes time to build and him expecting me to be sweet instantly is just so unfair to me. I can talk as friends, but not being lovey dovey when I myself feel unsafe and distrustful. This is a relationship where I am crying everyday. I am blamed for my emotions. \n\nNext steps? Worth staying, or will he cheat based on past patterns?\n\nTLDR: He (25M) emotionally cheated on me (25F) from June 2023–May 2024 with a girl best friend who manipulated both of us. I forgave him, but disrespect cycles continued until June 2025. Trust finally built back, but after he moved for his masters in Aug 2025, he hid new female friends, went on trips, and expects me to trust him instantly without giving it time, then blames me that I am distant. I feel unsafe, blamed for my reactions, and stuck crying daily in a relationship where my emotions are invalidated.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I love meeting and talking to foreigners, and eventually we caught interest in one another. We have been talking for over a year and two months, and dating for 8 months. Our bond grew stronger and stronger. We match so well and truly enjoy talking, calling, and seeing each other. I know we love each other deeply, and even though both of us have had physical relationships, we have never felt a love so pure, sincere, and strong like this one. The problem is that, as in any LDR, the distance between us feels heavy (and particularly on us, it is huge: 10,500 km with a 9-hour difference). While it’s possible to meet in a country in between to make expenses manageable, and we are planning to do it, closing the gap could realistically take years, many years. All of this considering that at this point, our financial situation cannot really make us afford to see each other even once a year.  \n\nI often find myself worrying about the future, how we’ll ever be physically together, when it will happen, and whether we can handle the challenges of being apart.

We just started long distance, and I honestly feel like things aren’t the same anymore.\n\nI recently went to visit him for a week, and during that time I don’t think I laughed with him once. I didn’t really feel love, or that he makes me happy. Instead, I felt ignored a lot of the time or like I was “too much” for him. I’m a very active, happy, excitable person, and he’s super laid back — but instead of balancing each other out, it feels like he brings me down.\n\nWhen we were together in bed or on the couch, there weren’t many signs of affection. We were mostly just on our phones or casually cuddling, but there was nothing exciting or intimate. There isn’t anything drastically wrong with the relationship — he’s a good guy: smart, good-looking, disciplined, etc. But he often ignores me when I talk, and when he does things like buy me flowers or show affection, it only happens after I’ve asked for it multiple times. It feels like he’s doing it just to shut me up rather than because he wants to.\n\nThe hard part is, I don’t feel excitement about seeing him, even after weeks apart. He doesn’t seem excited either (or at least doesn’t show it). Everything feels flat. And yet, I’m struggling with the idea of breaking up. Part of me doesn’t want to end it because we only just started long distance, and I don’t want him to move on quickly with someone else where he lives now. Honestly, I didn’t even really consider breaking up until tonight — it’s 4am, I can’t sleep, and I just keep thinking about all of this.\n\nI don’t know if I’m overthinking or if this is a sign the relationship has run its course. Has anyone been through something similar? How do you know when it’s time to end things?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "INSOMNIA"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He dropped out of school (for personal reasons I won’t share here), doesn’t work, doesn’t have a license, and lives at his parents. When we first started dating, he said he wanted to work soon and was actively searching. Seven months later, nothing has changed. I’ve brought it up multiple times but there are never any updates.\n\nI’m getting more and more annoyed because I feel like we’re not on the same page, and it’s breaking my heart. My ex was the exact same way older, didn’t work, and I ended up writing his CV and even applying for him. In that relationship I never got a gift, never had anything spent on me. I’m not materialistic, but for 3 years (between my ex and now) I’ve felt completely neglected.\n\nI love my current boyfriend to death and I keep encouraging him, but it just turns into frustration. He usually goes silent and just listens when I talk, and it drives me crazy. I believe in him, I know he’s capable of more than that, he can do it. He has a heart of gold. But when my friends ask me what my boyfriend does, I feel like a fool.\n\nHe’s in a privileged situation living at home with no bills. You’d think that would make it easier to work and save, but nothing happens. I’ve said all of this to him, over and over, for hours. We had a violent argument about it recently and I cried. He told me he finally “understood,” that it \"clicked\" but nothing changed too.\n\nI want us to see each other and that brings the question of the trip and necessarily the money. Those are all questions that are left unanswered and I grow more and more anxious. \n\nI feel terrible because I don’t know if I’m exaggerating or being unfair. But it feels like I’m reliving my ex all over again. I don’t want to be a mom to a grown man. My dad was also a bum who never supported my mom and left her all the time and I’m terrified of repeating that future.\n\nMeanwhile, I moved out at 17, pay for my food and bills, and go to university. I’m scared for him, because I love him and want him to succeed more than anything. But I’m also scared for myself, because I don’t want to waste years on someone who doesn’t change.\n\nWhat should I do? Am I being too harsh, or is it fair to feel like this?

Please feel free to ask questions and I’ll respond to as many as i can.

{"id": "u/Slow-Hat1748_1682", "user": "u/Slow-Hat1748", "text": "I (21/M) feel unwanted by my girlfriend (22/F) in our 9-month LDR\n\nHi Reddit, this is my last resort. I don’t have close friends to talk to about this, and I’m honestly at a breaking point. I (21/M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (22/F) for almost nine months. She’s my first serious relationship and I love her deeply, but when it comes to intimacy, I feel constantly confused, undesired, and hurt.\n\nShe has depression and started medication two or three months before we met. Early in the relationship, she was flirty, gave signs that she liked me, and spoke about intimacy in ways that made me feel wanted. A few months in, she told me she had made out with another guy at her gym. At that time, we had met in person a couple of times, but she hadn’t done that with me yet. Hearing it crushed me. I felt jealous, inadequate, and like I wasn’t enough. We fought, cried a lot, and eventually I forgave her because I saw her efforts before that incident. But it left a lasting scar.\n\nSince then, our physical intimacy has been limited. We cuddle, kiss, and hug, and she sometimes initiates affection. On calls, she tells me she misses me and wants to cuddle. So she’s not cold or distant. But when it comes to deeper sexual intimacy, it feels like I’m always the one initiating or asking for things she did naturally with others in her past. There have been a few times when I confronted her directly, crying and expressing my insecurities, asking why she refuses to be more intimate, and after those emotional conversations, we did have moments of intimacy. These moments happened a handful of times, but only after I pushed or after emotional breakdowns. Most of the time, if I try to engage without that buildup, she refuses or responds minimally.\n\nShe has said that the medication affects her libido and mood. She has suggested trying things like sexting or masturbating together, and we’ve had conversations about exploring each other’s needs. But almost every time, these ideas don’t turn into real follow-through. I will initiate flirtation or intimacy, and the most I usually get is a giggle, a small “thank you” or “mmm,” and then the moment dies or she falls asleep. This leaves me feeling rejected, inadequate, and like I’m constantly asking for something that should come naturally.\n\nRecently, I accidentally saw her browser history and realized she watches porn. That discovery hurt even more. It made me feel like she has sexual energy, but she doesn’t share it with me. I haven’t told her I know, but it’s added to my insecurities.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling unwanted, unattractive, and constantly comparing myself to her past. She has told me stories about making out with guys who turned out to be assholes, and I can’t help but feel jealous that she was more physically forward with them than with me, the person who loves her and treats her well. At the same time, she does show affection in other ways, so I’m stuck between feeling loved and feeling undesired.\n\nI don’t want to shame her for having depression or being on medication, and I don’t want to pressure her. But I also don’t want to spend the relationship feeling like a second choice or constantly inadequate. I’m struggling to reconcile my love for her with the hurt and insecurity I feel. I keep overthinking and feeling undesired even though she reassures me that we’ll try things and figure stuff out.\n\nI used ChatGPT to help frame my thoughts, so please don’t mind my phrasing English isn’t my first language. I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has perspective on how to handle intimacy challenges in an LDR where one partner has low libido due to medication, depression, or past experiences.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nI (21/M) am in a 9-month LDR with my girlfriend (22/F) who has depression and started meds before we met. Early on she was flirty, but now she rarely initiates sexual intimacy and I feel undesired. She made out with another guy early in the relationship, which left me insecure, and recently I found out she watches porn, making me feel worse. I’m always the one initiating intimacy, and the few moments of deeper intimacy usually only happen after emotional breakdowns or serious confrontation. She suggests trying things like sexting or masturbating together but rarely follows through. I love her but feel inadequate and unwanted.

He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me. So I’m genuinely confused by all of this. \n\nNow he’s apologised and said he’s giving me time and space to figure out what I want and where I want to go from here which has really confused me because I’ve always been open about how I feel about him and that I wanted to meet him in person and see if we could start a relationship which is something at the start of us talking, he was open to but now he’s completely against it. He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. I don’t really know how to speak to him again. I miss him like crazy, I felt like we had some kind of bond and he agreed but now he’s switched up completely, he even says he never misses people so I guess I’ll fall into the category. \n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute he acts as if we are in a committed relationship i.e we made an agreement not to do anything sexual or even touch ourselves unless we were both doing it, things like that which hint to being in a relationship then I ask him what we are or talk about my feelings and he shuts it down. He tells me he does genuinely care about me and everything else and part of me believes in his own way he does but right now I feel like I’ve wasted 9 months but at the same time I haven’t really because he’s helped me through a lot of shit at the same time - I feel attached to him but I don’t think it’s necessarily a good attachment.\n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me. My head is a mess with the overthinking. He doesn’t want me but doesn’t want me to go? It’s making me feel like I’m just not good enough.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/blaubarschbube27_1689", "user": "u/blaubarschbube27", "text": "Struggling with anxiety in my long-distance relationship\n\nHey everyone,  \nI’m looking for some outside perspective because I feel kind of lost.\n\nI’ve been in a long-distance relationship for about three months now. We actually spent six weeks on vacation together recently, and things were amazing. When we’re physically together, I usually feel pretty secure and happy. But every time we separate, I find myself spiraling with anxious thoughts.\n\nFor example, this morning I texted her “good morning” and didn’t hear back for a couple of hours. I knew she was awake, and I caught myself thinking things like, “Why isn’t she replying? Is she losing interest?” Later she called, but I missed it while having breakfast. When I called back, she didn’t pick up — which makes sense because she’s at work — but even then, I felt rejected. My brain goes straight to, “She doesn’t care enough to tell me she’s at work” or “She should’ve texted me she’ll call later.”\n\nIt’s exhausting. I know she’s the opposite of me — she doesn’t overthink this stuff, and she shows me a lot of reassurance when we’re together. But when we’re apart, I feel powerless and helpless. Even things like journaling, walking, or meditation don’t seem to stop my mind from going back to the same thought: *“She’s annoyed with me, she doesn’t want to talk to me.”*\n\nI keep asking myself: do I need to change? Do I need to be less anxious and just learn to trust more? Or should I be open with her about what I need, like asking for a quick text when she’s busy, even if it feels like a “ridiculous” request? I don’t know what’s normal and what’s too much.\n\n\n\nSo my question is:  \nHas anyone else struggled with this kind of anxiety in a long-distance relationship? How did you deal with it? Did you find ways to self-soothe, or did you communicate your needs to your partner? How do you find the balance between trusting and asking for reassurance?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/ohawhatsthat_1691", "user": "u/ohawhatsthat", "text": "Anxiety about closing the gap and how to make it work (Germany - UK)\n\nI’ve had these thoughts for a while, sometimes they just creep up and are made worse by my anxiety, but in general this is what I think about a lot. \n\nI am in Germany, my partner is in the UK. We are the same age but he’s so much further in life: living alone, bought his own place, car, has a good job, a good social circle. I feel like I am so behind, everything he has, I don’t have. \n\nGenerally it would be easier for me to move to him, I speak his language while he doesn’t speak mine, I don’t really have anything holding me here except for my family and even that I’m fine with leaving, as harsh as that sounds. And in general, I think life in the UK would be better for me than life for him in Germany. \n\nWe’ve been together for six months and we have had conversations about closing the gap etc. but I feel that we have very different view points on how this is going to work out, like our timelines are not matching. He thinks it’s as easy as just applying to jobs, getting a skilled worker visa, and I’m set. \n\nI’m doing my driving license now, something that he pushed for which I appreciate to have his support on, I would have liked to move out and live on my own first, preferably in a different city in my country, find a new job here to gain more experience before seriously applying to the UK, because I can’t just apply for “funsies, memes and yolo” like him. I want to put effort into it so I have the best chance of actually getting accepted. How it’s going to work there is another question and issue, like getting to London since he lives in a different city and I don’t think I’ll find a job in my field there, but that’s an issue that can be solved. \n\nI told him from the beginning that closing the gap for real would be at least another year, most likely longer. I know it sucks and i also want it to happen sooner but how is this going to work? Right now I’m doing the license, that’s at least another 2-3 months until I have it, another few until I’m actually very confident in driving alone. Then it’s looking for a job and place to live here, which I don’t want to leave after only a year. I mean, leaving a job after a year that’s fine whatever, but the apartment won’t even be done within a year and I wouldn’t want to move after such a short time and waste all that money. Even if I do leave after a year, that’s still at least another year and a half until I can seriously think about going to the UK. Of course I could also apply to places in the UK at the same time, but with my current CV and experience I highly doubt it’s going to go anywhere. I got really fucked by covid unfortunately and I’ve been trying to gain more work experience and show that I can do stuff, but there’s still doubt in my mind about it. \n\nPlease don’t misunderstand, I love him and I want to be with him. Maybe it’s just my anxiety about everything in general, maybe he’s right and it’s not as big of a deal as I make it to be. If we were in the same country, I would leave everything behind and move to him. If the UK was still in the EU it would also be easier but as it is now, it is not easy for me.\n\nThere is also something to be said about his family. We haven’t met yet but from what he tells me, his parents wanted him to end up with an Indian girl, marry, have kids, etc. and most of all, they want him / us to have a plan. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, but am I wrong in saying we have only been together half a year and I can’t give them a step by step timeline of the next ten years? I asked him if they really expect us to get married within a year and he said they probably do. Of course I want to marry him, kids I am very much on the fence about, but how am I supposed to give him a plan of our life when I don’t even know what next week is going to look like? \n\nWe visit every 6-8 weeks and spend at least a week together in person, we even had our first vacation together recently, video call every day, even when he’s traveling and the time difference is huge. We still make it work. Of course I want our visits to turn into our everyday lives but I just don’t know how to do it right now. \n\nNow, this is completely just my anxiety talking because he hasn’t given me any indication like pulling away, talking less etc. but I’m scared I will lose him. We are best friends and we love each other, how we make each other feel and express our gratitude for each other every day. But I can’t say that I would blame him if he left, I know that my anxiety and me in general can be a lot to handle and I hate that I am putting him through this. I know there are couples who have been together for years before closing the gap and they made it work too. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like when I bring it up, it usually leads to him disagreeing (in a sweet and kind way, but disagreeing nonetheless) because his brain just works differently, which he also already acknowledged as well. \n\nAre there any encouraging insights from people who have been doing this a long time or have already closed the gap? Maybe someone specially Germany - UK who made it work?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}
{"id": "u/EternallyNotFine_1692", "user": "u/EternallyNotFine", "text": "Struggling\n\nPutting this under \"venting\" because I think it fits best.\n\nThe boy I love is in the UK, while I'm in the US. We've known each other for about 3 years, after meeting online. He's been my rock that entire time, always doing what he could to comfort me through the ups and downs, and I to him. We drifted apart slightly, but recently had started talking more again. We started sleeping on call, and then calling almost every morning, playing games together. After a while, I realized I was developing feelings. I tried to ignore them, because every relationship I've been in, it was either toxic, or I just got my heart broken. I didn't want to open myself up to that again..but I couldn't keep my big mouth shut. I eventually told him, because he could sense I was anxious about something (said crush being the reason). He then also confessed, calling me \"my love\". As it progressed, he told me all the sweetest things, that he would prepare dinner for me every night and take care of me, sweet talk me in Spanish (calling me his universe, that he would do anything for me), spoil me in a game we played together, and assure me he loves me and one day we'll see each other, even saying he would order us matching bracelets and said he would send me one half. He wanted to be official, and I said I do too, but that I might need to wait a short bit, so we can talk about what that would look like, and to make sure I'm ready for another relationship, but that I know I love him dearly. He said \"And I'll wait as long as you need me to mi amor\". (I had actually planned on asking him to be official shortly before, all this that happened. I know that sounds contradictory, I had just realized \"I want to be with him\" sooner than I thought I would, after that conversation).\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nI started trying to save for the trip to visit him during this, ($600-$1000, though money is hard right now), and I'd look forward to all of his texts, just wanting to talk to the love of my life. Soon enough he started college again, and we had less time together- one time he didn't text me for 2 days, but posted on his Social media story.. Which kind of hurt, but I figured he's busy with more important things.\n\nBut, recently, he told me that it's best if we're \"just friends for now\". He \"doesn't want to upset me by not having time for me\", \"I don't think I can do long distance\", \"He still wants to talk as friends and play games and stuff\".. Acting like nothing we talked about mattered. After everything he said. After telling me himself he wanted to be with me.\n\nHe said \"You don't have to wait for me, go find someone and be happy\".. but I can't. My trust feels shattered, even though I know he said \"friends for now\", and not \"I don't love you anymore\". It feels like everything he said is a lie now. I don't know what to trust. I'm torn between still working towards our goal of moving in together, and being with him, or just throwing everything away and giving up on ever finding someone who loves me. I have some money saved up, but I might have to use it so my electricity doesn't get shut off.\n\nHe said \"I don't want to say something confusing, thats not fair to you\".. After all that. After months of talking and promising he loves me and that he can't wait to see me one day, and living together. Why would you say that.. now..?\n\nHe also keeps posting things on his story, like posts of \"I love you like I love ___\", and a post saying \"Life is too short, confess to your crush\" with a song called \"i hope you're okay\" playing on the story. I've been just avoiding his stories, and that social media since I saw that because it hurts too much. I want him in my life but I can't even keep a conversation with him without bursting into tears.\n\nI know he said it's not over, \"just for now\" but why?? You were fine being together a week ago, why not now..? Why reciprocate if you're not even sure?\n\nI guess I'm just venting to the void. I don't know what to do, besides rot here. I don't think anyone will actually love me. And that's fine. I just don't want to be promised the world then have it ripped  away in a single morning.\n\nIf you want to leave advice, feel free, just please be nice.

After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year.

We haven’t spent time/spoken in a while, and he feels like i deserve more. He feels lonely because of the distance, and with everything happening feels like he needs less on his plate. We were seriously ending things, then called and ended up not breaking up. We don’t want to split but i want what’s best for him. Currently not able to see each other due to financial issues on both ends. Unsure what to do.\n\napologies for the essay, i tried to summarize it as much as i could\n\nWe met online through a video game (i had just turned 19, he was 18 for a few months, born in same year), and we never intended to have something online, but we truly fell for each other. We had our ups and downs, doubts here and there, but we have not once broken up. We’ve only taken one break for about 2-3 weeks(both tried to not text the other), but have stayed together because we want something serious.\n\nNow to the issue- we haven’t really spoken too much or really spent that much time together or even spoken much/called in a month- a month and a half, and i figured he wanted more space and just didn’t know it (thought this because that was the reasoning for the previous break, he was under a lot of stress). But he came to me saying that he thinks we should end things, he’s under a lot of pressure from family issues, financial issues, personal issues, and it hurts him that i can’t be there to comfort him. \n\nHe said he wishes i was there because he wants physical touch, and for someone to comfort him. That it hurts him because he misses me so much but he can’t even hold me (it’s been a problem in the past). And with everything going on with him he feels like he needs less off his plate, just so he doesn’t have to worry about it as much.\n\nHe feels as though he’s not good enough for me, as i value quality time, and there’s been a few times where i had gotten upset because we wouldn’t spend as much time together. He feels like he’s holding me back from finding someone better, but i always told him that despite everything he’s a good guy and genuinely treats me well, and a bunch of things i love about him that makes him better than others. Even during arguments he has never called me names or said terrible things.\n\nAs much as i hated the idea of losing him (we are really attached to each other) i chose to respect his decision and even though i wanted to beg him to stay, i decided not to. He told me this over text, and he sounded serious about it. He said even though we are broken up, we’ll still have each others phone numbers to text each other every now and then, because he can’t imagine just throwing me away and never talking to me again. So i asked him if we could call for the last time before we do.\n\nAt first he sounded sure about it all, but after everything he said he had a “wtf am i doing” moment, and realized he doesn’t want to lose me. He doesn’t want to end things, if anything take a break, but he still doesn’t want to do that. I’m still not 100% sure where he stands, we planned to talk about it later today too. At the end of the call it sounded like we weren’t splitting up, we went from crying to even laughing a little. Hearing my voice again apparently reminded him that what we have is real and genuine.\n\nThing is, i genuinely don’t want to lose him. I love him with all my heart. I can’t imagine my life without him because he’s such an important part of my day, even when we barely talk. But i thought about if he’s constantly worrying about me/us, it might not be the best thing for him. He says he genuinely loves me and i always will have a special place in his heart. And as much as it hurts me i want the best for him. Even when it sounded like we were done he truly wanted what was best for me, he wanted me to do things to help myself.\n\nCurrently because of everything we haven’t been able to see each other. We are both struggling financially and simply don’t have the money to see each other, although we really want to. I offered to contribute to his flight and hotel and maybe even pay for one or the both fully when im able to, but he doesn’t feel like i should be paying for everything, because he wants to be able to do things together and buy me stuff/spoil me (we “fight” about this lol, i want to spoil him too).\n\nI thought about a few options:\n-break up completely, which seems really scary and extreme\n\n-taking a break until one of us either can’t take it, or is ready to make a decision if we stay or separate \n\n-taking a break until his situation is better\n\n-slightly limit contact, maybe video call once 1-2 weeks to update each other, and so we can see each others faces/hear our voices more regularly and to remember what we have\n \n-keep somewhat our current situation and text when we feel like it, so we don’t feel alone\n\nwhat should we do? i’ve thought about bringing up option 4 to him, but i would like to hear other people’s opinions or other possible choices", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

When he came back, he said he felt depressed  after the hike. I feel like his being distant and i brought that up to him and he just said sorry, no reassurance, no efforts, nothing.\n\nToday i ask him if we could talk because i really cant keep feeling this way. He said hes not feeling himself after the hike and realize during hiking that the distance was too much, too much obstacles to be together, and he have discussion with his friend about it. I ask him if he wants me to stay or leave and he couldnt answer and just said \"i dont know\". He asked for a break and i said for how long and he didnt know until he told me  to just break up since he dont want me to expect anything anymore.

Our first six months were in person, we were in the same school and lived close by, so had a lot of time together. Then she moved to Canada (from South Africa where I still live) with her parents. We knew from the start she would move.\n\nWe were very naïve and very hopeful, despite being very young, both still in school (well when she moved I was already first year uni but yeah) and we thought it was worth trying. And although it was difficult at first, we adapted to the distance and the time difference and made it work. Over the months we played a lot of video games together, had calls whenever we could and yeah was nice. We did however run into a rough patch that lasted quite a while, since last year September we were growing a little bit distance in terms of romantic connection, which I think can be natural in long distance I guess, and yeah, through lack of effort in some ways on both ends there was a bit of a hole in our relationship. At the time we could never do video calls or spend proper time together because her parents did not support our relationship, and when they finally became a bit more lenient with it she was upset with me that I wasn’t all of a sudden all lovey dovey on calls and stuff like that, and yeah buy around May, maybe June we were at a breaking point, where we almost broke up due to all of this and some other clashes in the relationship where she felt I wasn’t putting in necessary effort, and I felt the same as there was so much she couldn’t sacrifice to have more time with me.\n\nBut anyway, we did manage to work through that, and things were going well, and truthfully still are, well as good as a long distance with time difference can go I suppose. Good news came later in June, being that she would be back in South Africa in August, the other side of the country though, but her parents finally agreed that i can come live with them for two weeks in the house they would be in. So I did that, I used basically all my savings and spent the two weeks with her, first time seeing eachother since she moved in March 2024.  And all went well, we had some clashes with the parents because they still don’t approve of me (very conservative Christians, they feel dating shouldn’t be a thing and especially not long distance, plus I have a tattoo and yeah they don’t like that at all. I am also very Christian, but yeah they are not forgiving with these kinds of things so).\n\nBut now we’re back home and back to distance and all still was well. However, things have started to change from both our ends, in terms of our personal lives. Her family is struggling with permenant residency still, as the job her dad has isn’t as secure as they thought, and is at risk of losing at any moment and does nothing in terms of support for getting residency. So there is a chance that in a year or so they’ll be in a different place in Canada, with a much harder time difference, or in America, or even in Australia. But not back here in South Africa. Additionally, from my side my family is struggling too. My dad’s business is failing and he is barely making enough to afford our necessities, but bills are piling and debt is rising. I am 20 so I can be independent, but I am studying right now, getting a paying job here is next to imposible while studying, and yeah the job market even after I got the degree is looking worse every day. I make money online though, I started doing youtube, and it pays me more than what my mom even makes, and my plan was to save up that money to be able to visit my gf in Canada next year, and then likely study in Canada to get my post grad and work permit there. But yeah, now im going to have to switch my focus and use my money on my family and help pay bills, cover my student fees and basically have to use whatever I can to help them. The prospect of visits, or even attempting to even move in the next 5 to 10 years is very very unlikely, if ever. And of course, with our dreams of me being able to move to her asap, yeah, its gonna make issues.\n\nSo all that said, I am afraid that through our own personal life issues with our families we’ll hold each other back. After all we are still very young, and we our still dependent on our families in a way, and cannot just move out and live our own lives, that’s imposible right now. The only thing that is holding us together rn is faith, and the hope and prayers that a miracle happens. But maybe through everything God is showing us that we shouldn’t be doing this, and we aren’t meant to be, as we previously thought.\n\nThere is the option of trying to approach the situation and see how far are we willing to go and how long are we willing to wait, because yeah, 10+ years is very likely. And how much are we willing to sacrifice, because yeah, I sacrifice as much as I can and I am always available to spend time with her as I do my work in the morning while she’s still asleep, but yeah, most days of the week we barely talk because she is just unable to make time for me most days, due to classes, family or any other reason you could imagine. It feels draining, and as much as I love her and feel like I will always love her, I am starting to feel like we are chasing a dream that is ultimately just a dream.\n\n \n\nThis was a long one, and if you are still reading, I would love any insight, opinions or even advice on what to do next, if anything.

He’s very successful, and financially well-off, while I’m about to turn 25 and start my own career. From the very beginning, he’s been incredibly attentive — constant calls and texts, thoughtful little gifts and snacks, virtual movie nights, and sweet compliments. He calls me his queen, tells me I’m everything to him, and I genuinely feel cared for and happy.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I’d like some perspective on:\n\n•The speed of the relationship: He told me he loves me about 2 months in. He’s already talking about marriage and children and is planning to fly to my country soon to meet my parents and formally ask their permission.\n\n•His sexual openness: He sometimes asks me for pictures, and when I send him regular outfit selfies, he’ll tell me he masturbated to them. I don’t know if this is common behavior for men or if it’s too much too soon.\n\n•His past relationships: His most recent ex is a celebrity from our home country who has publicly shared that she was raped by another rapper before she dated him. Our country unfortunately has a high HIV/AIDS rate, which has made me a bit anxious about sexual health in general. I’d like to ask him to get tested before we become physical, but I’m nervous about how to bring it up respectfully.\n\n•Dating history & preferences: He avoids the subject when I ask how many women he’s been with, which makes me think it might be a lot. He’s mentioned he usually prefers curvier women, and all of his exes look nothing like me — I’m quite slim. He’s also made comments about younger women being “better” and said he’s always wanted a “trophy wife.”\n\n•Appearance-related comments: I have light brown hair that can look golden in the sun, but he insists I’m blonde and says he’s always wanted a blonde wife. I know he means it as a compliment, but it sometimes makes me feel like I don’t measure up to this ideal image he has in his head.\n\nOverall, he treats me very well, and I do feel happy with him — but I also want to make sure I’m not getting swept up in something that’s moving too quickly.\n\nQuestions I’d love advice on:\n\nIs this kind of intensity normal in new, long-distance relationships, or does it sound like love bombing?\n\nHow can I bring up the topic of sexual health and testing without making it uncomfortable?\n\nHow do I know if I should slow things down, and what’s a healthy pace for a relationship like this?\n\nAre his comments about younger women, curvier women, and “trophy wives” harmless preferences, or should I be concerned about how he views women?\n\nHow do I keep my insecurities in check when he compares me (even indirectly) to his ideal “type”?\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts and any practical advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I had a long distance boyfriend from the same hometown my first year and I really hated it. it was really hard to only see him on weekends and it was horrible for my mental health.\n\nMe and my current partner got into a relationship over this past summer. Going into the relationship I knew it would be difficult as I had went through the same situation before. I will take accountability in that regard. But he reassured me that he would move in with me going into my junior year of college. now, he told me he doesn’t know if he should move in with me because I want to pursue law school in a different state. he said he wants to now wait until i am entirely done with college for us to move in together.\n\nI don’t know if I’m being selfish, but ever since he told me this, I’ve been so upset.

I made a post on here a little while ago explaining some of my situation and I’ve tried communicating but nothing much has changed\n\nIm tired and I feel like I don’t deserve the way he’s treating me, I love him with all my heart and I like to think I treat him as such but part of me thinks that I deserve better and that he’s “holding me back,” as shitty as that sounds and believe me I really do feel guilty for thinking that way but I can’t help it.\n\nEverything has been different ever since he confessed to me in July that he had a crush on another boy, I was heartbroken and I cried for 10 hours straight that day, I hesitated to tell him but I did tell him and it felt like he had no remorse. When he told me he had a crush on that boy he said he “only liked him but didn’t love him the way he loved me”, we talked and I was upset but willing to work through it with him, mostly because of how devastated I was in the moment and how badly I didn’t want to lose him. He told me they only knew each other for a month but “he’s been sending me cute videos and I feel guilty for rejecting him” which honestly leads me to believe he was emotionally cheating on me, even now it still hurts so badly to think about it and I’ve been having reoccurring dreams of him leaving and cheating on me.\n\nI begged him to stay and not leave me for that boy until he turned it back onto me and said I couldn’t be what he needed, that I wasn’t bold enough and didn’t show him the love he wanted or needed, so we went on a “break” because in his words, “I don’t want to see him or you right now”. There’s too much to go over but eventually we got back together.\n\nFast-forward a month, he joined this minecraft game server where he was being flirted with. He invited me to the sever and I was annoyed with the flirting and didn’t like it so I told him, he said it was a joke and in his words again, “this is why I was afraid to invite you, because you take things too seriously. even things\nlike this, I want to be allowed to joke around too” so I let him, he’s russian and so are all his friends so I couldn’t understand what they were saying but I translated it and he was denying that we were together. I left the game after the flirting got too much and since he was ignoring me too, later a screenshot was shown to me of that conversation.\n\nHe urged me to leave the server and completely stop playing so I did and I can only assume the flirting continued but I told myself, “what I don’t know can’t hurt me” and kept living like that. Up until now, he barely texts me, I send him paragraphs about how much I love him, I send him cute videos, I try to be more “bold and brazen” like he wants me to, but nothing seems good enough for him and im\ntired. I invest too much effort into him and this relationship just to get basically nothing back, when actually does respond to something I send he’s dry and uninterested yet I see him posting in his telegram channel and playing with his friends meanwhile I have to beg for even an ounce of attention.\n\nI just need help I want us to work out. We’ve been together since August 14, 2024 and it feels like I’ve made so many exceptions for him and let so many things slide that he would have never let slide for me.

I was so ready to get away from my overbearing parents and finally have freedom. I’ve never really been into partying, so that part of the “college experience” wasn’t a thing for me anyway. I was busy adjusting, making friends, and trying to figure out how to survive lol\n\nSome important context (TW: mental health stuff): I was in a really rough place. Depression and anxiety aren’t new for me, but after dealing with my ex and some other stressors, I was at probably the lowest point I’ve ever been. My boyfriend has also struggled with mental health issues, and when we did talk, it was usually late at night, emotionally intense, and toxic (I’ll hurt myself if you hurt yourself kind of stuff)\n\nI ended up in a friend group of three guys and another girl from my classes. We mostly studied, but we’d hang for hours just chatting and joking around. At one point, I missed a session because I was admitted to the hospital overnight. I didn’t go into detail with the group, but the next morning I ran into one of the guys — let’s call him K. He noticed I wasn’t okay and offered to listen. Over time, I leaned on him emotionally a lot. He was stable, calm, and easy to vent to compared to how things were with my bf then.\n\nMy bf knew I had male friends, but not how emotionally close I’d gotten with K. I instinctively kept it vague because of my past with my ex. K and I never hung out alone, never had romantic or sexual contact, and we were very clear about boundaries (he knew I had a boyfriend) But we were emotionally close, and I depended on him in ways that looking back, do seem sketchy\n\nUnderstandably, when my boyfriend found out how close I was with K, he got upset. At the time, I got defensive and, in hindsight, made it worse. Not being upfront about it caused lasting trust issues. Even now, my bf brings it up sometimes. He still thinks I cheated, and there’s nothing I can say to completely convince him otherwise.\n\nTL;DR: Fall 2023 was rough. We were both emotionally unstable, our late-night venting was toxic, and I got really close with a male friend without being fully upfront with my bf. He thinks I cheated, but I didn’t.\n\n\n\n\n2ND SEMESTER + 2ND YEAR\n(Spring 2024–Spring 2025) ————————————————— \nAfter the chaos of Fall 2023, things finally calmed down. We were both a lot more stable mentally, and although our sleep schedules were still terrible, we were functioning. Neither of us failed classes or anything, but life felt a little more manageable.\n\nAt this point, I was a sophomore in college (18) and he was a senior in high school (16). The age gap was less of an issue now that he could drive, get a job, and I could rent Airbnbs when we visited. We got better at being independent and communicating, which made the long-distance part much easier.\n\nWe started seeing each other more regularly. Sometimes we split plane tickets and he’d stay in my dorm; other times I’d drive home for a long weekend. Being able to spend quality time together while still having our separate lives helped a ton. We were also better at handling conflict without spiraling like the previous semester.\n\nHonestly, this year really cemented our relationship. We both grew a lot, individually and as a couple.\n\nTL;DR: Things got easier. We were more independent, communicated better, and seeing each other became more manageable. Long distance wasn’t perfect, but it was sustainable.\n\n\n\nCURRENT (Summer 2025–Fall 2025) ————————————————————— \nSo my bf graduated high school (yay!) and I stayed in my college town over the summer to work. At this point, we’re 18 (me) and 17 (him), which made this summer a little tricky — no long breaks from long distance like we’d had before. Still, I was able to see him about every three weeks, which was doable.\n\nHe came up in July and stayed for nine days. This was the first real experience of living together. I still went to work, but we woke up together, cooked meals, went to the gym, and just hung out. Honestly, it was amazing. There weren’t any habits that really annoyed me just small stuff like stealing covers or leaving a plate in the sink.\n\nCurrently, I’m a junior in college (19) and he’s a freshman (just turned 18). He’s at a smaller state school about 1.5 hours from our hometown, technically closer than before, but still a 7-hour drive for me. He’s in a dorm, I’m in an apartment. We both have jobs and demanding majors, so free time is limited, but we make it work.\n\nTL;DR: Summer 2025 was our first real living-together test and we’re still making long distance work even with busy schedules.\n\n\n\nGUSHY STUFF \n————————— \nOkay, now that all the background’s out of the way, yes, we love each other. And I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t still be here if it was just infatuation or dumb teenage love\n\nWhen we first got together, nobody expected it to last. I was president of everything in high school, while he was more introverted, doing his own thing. I grew up in a small town where my family had a reputation and I’ve always been “so and so’s daughter.” My relationship with my parents is surface-level at best, all about grades, money, and appearances. I wasn’t used to being vulnerable or open emotionally, so making real friendships was tough.\n\nThen I met him. And I was blown away by how little he cared about what anyone thought. Not in an “I’m a loner” way — just that he was confident being himself and didn’t chase approval. From day one, we talked about the hard stuff: feelings, fears, hopes, everything. Being with him has changed me so much. I’m more genuine, less worried about impressing people, and I have friends who actually know me. I have a partner who loves me for me, and that’s huge.\n\nHe’s patient, kind, and supportive even when I’m emotionally messy. He encourages me to grow, believes in me, and doesn’t make me prove my worth. Despite him being younger, I look up to him constantly — he’s hardworking, passionate, and emotionally mature. Over 2.5 years, my love for him hasn’t faded. Long distance is hard, sure. I’ve doubted whether it could work. But I’ve never doubted that I love him, and we’ve never broken up or taken a break.\n\nTL;DR: We love each other deeply, it’s serious, mature, and not surface-level. Long distance is tough, but our relationship is real and lasting.\n\n\n\nCRITICISMS ————————— \n“What about the college experience?!” \nIf by “college experience” people mean partying, drinking, and hooking up, that’s never been my thing. I’ve gone to a few parties and a bar a couple times, but it’s just not my scene. I’ve still made friends, joined a sorority, play in a band, and have plenty of fun. My bf trusts me, I trust him, and our social lives aren’t limited by our relationship. Honestly, hearing about other people’s cheating and drama makes me so grateful for what we have. We know each other really well, and what we have is rare.\n\n“People change.” \nYes, and we’ve changed a lot. But so far we’ve only changed in ways that made us closer, more compatible, and better for each other and ourselves. We know we’ll continue to grow, and that’s fine. The important stuff  like values, life goals, political/religious views hasn’t shifted enough to matter. I hope we change- I know I don’t want to be the person I am right now in 5 years\n\n“But you’re so young.” \nYeah, we’re aware. We’re freshly adults, brains still developing, and all that. But we share goals, values, and a love that’s lasted 2.5 years so far. We’re not rushing into marriage or kids — that’s years away, when we’re financially and emotionally ready. I’m finishing my bachelor’s in 2027 then heading to grad school somewhere.  He graduates in 2029 and we’ll figure it out. We’re patient and committed, and neither of us wants to hold the other back. Sure, some people ask if I’ll drop out of college to be closer to him- I would never. He applied to the school I go to, but got a full-tuition scholarship elsewhere which would be stupid to turn down. Living close a couple years sooner isn’t worth sacrificing our career goals and finances.\n\n\n\nPROBLEMS \n——————— \nOne of the hardest things has been dealing with my family’s judgment. His family is supportive, but mine never were. From the start, they dismissed him because he’s younger, from a different family background, and “doesn’t have the same resources as us.” Both of my parents come from wealthy families, and have doctorate degrees, while neither of his parents went to college and they both work in industry jobs where they get paid by the hour. When we started dating he was 15, they made comments about him just wanting our money because he couldn’t pay for all of our dates. Keep in mind he was 15- not old enough to get a drivers license yet and his family only has one car. He couldn’t get a job because he was raising his younger siblings because one parent worked days and the other nights. They nitpicked his clothes, saying they weren’t fashionable or didn’t fit right (because all he had were hand-me-downs) They body-shamed him for being skinny, saying things like, “Don’t you want a real man who can pick you up and swing you around?” which is ridiculous because he’s 6 feet tall, just skinny because his family literally didn’t have access to enough food. Plus I’m not superficial enough to choose a partner solely off looks (regardless I think my boyfriend insanely attractive) The one that hurts him the most is refusing to get to know his parents because they aren’t part of the same social circle. It all makes me so sick to know that my own parents could treat someone who means so much to me this way.\n\nIt kills me because none of that even comes close to who he actually is. He’s smart, driven, responsible, and works his ass off , paying for college himself, working full-time, and still pursuing his passions as well. But my family judges him like he’s failing at life because he doesn’t fit their idea of “success” or come from the right background. They’ve never bought him a birthday or Christmas gift, never invite him to holidays or dinners, and still treat him like he’s just a friend. It’s insulting, and sometimes it makes me wonder if they’ll ever see him for who he really is.\n\nWatching him work so hard breaks my heart. He barely sleeps, forgets to eat, and pushes himself so he can succeed. It’s not sustainable, and I constantly worry he might have to quit school because he literally can’t afford it. And if that happens, I know my family won’t understand why I’m still with him — they’d probably see it as proof he isn’t good enough.\n\nTL;DR: My family constantly judges him for age, money, and background, completely ignoring his intelligence, work ethic, and character. It’s frustrating, unfair, and exhausting — but despite all this, he’s hardworking, responsible, and our relationship is stronger for it.\n\nIf you actually read this far- wow because I typed a lot. if anyone has advice for dealing with all the negative shit people say and issues with my family please let me know.

We trust each other deeply, our relationship is strong, and she even wants to apply to the same university I’m at. She’s got a real chance of getting in, but her dad might not agree. Even if that happens, she still plans to come to the U.S., which would make it so much easier for us to meet.\n\nOur story is kind of complicated, so forgive me for laying it all out to explain my question.\n\nI first met her when I was in my last year of high school and she was just starting hers. She confessed pretty quickly, and honestly, I didn’t take the relationship very seriously at first. Me and her wasn’t very mature back then, and she was also really obsessed with me. I couldn’t handle how demanding she was, and I wasn’t mature myself either, so after I moved to the U.S., I broke up with her.\n\nThat breakup really crushed her. She was depressed for months. During that time, she started dating one of our mutual friends, then later hooked up with another mutual friend, and even went to clubs looking for one-night stands.\n\nWhen I came home for the summer, she told me she still had feelings for me. This time, I realized she’d matured, and I could actually see her as someone who might be my lifelong partner. The problem is: I can’t get the images of her having sgs with our mutual friends out of my head. It really tortures me. At my request, we’ve cut ties with those mutual friends, but the thoughts still haunt me.\n\nI know she’s loyal to me now. I really do trust her. But how do I find peace of mind? How do I quiet these intrusive thoughts and move on so I can be fully happy with her?\n\nIf more details are needed, I would like to provide it.

In the beginning she was pushing to be in a relationship with me, she said I love u first, said she was looking for a serious relationship and wanted to get married and have my kids. I know to most people that it’s a red flag for those kind of discussions while getting to know the person but i really liked this girl and i guess made myself comfortable with these types of conversations.\nAfter she went to college things were still going pretty well, i went up to visit her and had a good time but I felt that one of her friends (her roommate) was a bit wild and care free. \nAs time went on, me and my girlfriend started talking very less. I noticed and I pointed it out and she told me that she is doing midterms and   She would be busier and that school was her priority. She also claimed that i was too clingy. I was confused because I feel that more communication is important in long distance. I tried to be better and give her space but as time went on she began rushing a sorority and kept going out on weekends even though she was “too busy”. She is dealing with financial issues rn and she’s tryna join a sorority when the dues are 1000 a semester. I held my tongue. \nThe final straw was Saturday night when we were on the phone, she was talking about being a stripper for the money and i told her i didn’t want that for her, idk if she was joking or serious. Then we changed the topic. At the end of the call we said “i love you” and I said “i love u more” and she said “i think u do love me more” which really upset me.\nOn Sunday Morning I texted her goodmorning at 10am and she texted me back at 3pm, even though she’d been active all day. \nI sent her a long text about the problems we’ve been having about how we have a lack of communication and that i feel that she’s been disrespectful to me and she texted back another 2 hours later calling me out for love bombing her and being too clingy. She mentioned that we are at two different maturity levels and that she’s busy with class. (Fyi she was all over me on the first date and said “i love u” after 1 week of going out).\nWe were going back and forth and everyone I talked to about it said she was manipulating me.\nRegardless, I told her if u have a problem with what i’m doing i will try to work on them, but when i ask u to not be disrespectful to me or answer the phone or text me to keep me updated, i’m “tryna change her entire life”.\n\nYesterday morning I tried to make up with her and apologized for getting heated and she sent a long text about how she loves me, knows we both could make changes but thinks we take some time apart and go on a break.

I fell in love with the girl i met a couple months ago but the girl i’ve been seeing for the past 2 weeks is not what i fell in love with, if that makes any sense. I’m gonna see her next weekend.

I have wanted to live where my SO lives for years now, and they’re an only child, so they have to take care of their parents eventually right?\n\nThe discord is that my mother and sibling feel like they don’t “know them” very well, and my SO and I have discussed that we do need to do more socializing with the family (because we often end up doing our own thing when we finally get to get back together from long distance for a few days). However, with my SO having school and a job, it makes it difficult for them to visit, and my mother says that she isn’t exactly willing to get to know someone on FaceTime, Zoom, phone call, whatever alternative I could offer.\n\nMy mother and sibling both seem to think that my SO is trying to steal me away from them, and that I am the “keystone” piece of the family and that suddenly everything will fall apart without me there (For some backstory, my younger sibling has special needs, and my mother says that without me there would be problems).

{"id": "u/Over-Regular8073_1771", "user": "u/Over-Regular8073", "text": "[22F/22M] - I can't stand it anymore.\n\nMe (Polish) and my Spanish boyfriend met during his Erasmus 2 years ago and became a couple. When his Erasmus finished, we started long distance because we both had to finish our bachelor’s degree. In his case - a bachelor’s is enough to get a nice job. In mine - without a master’s it’s really hard, and my family also wants me to finish my MA, which takes 2 years. My boyfriend assured me that the long distance was going to last only one year - when he finished his studies, he would come to my country again. This summer, during his stay here, we even were looking for some flats to rent. We even agreed that I could pay the rent until he found a job. But suddenly he changed his mind. He said that renting is a waste of money, that it’s better to wait and buy a flat. He also said he wouldn’t earn as much as in Spain and he was not going to stay. My heart broke in that moment. I had the happy future already pictured in my mind and suddenly everything was destroyed. I remember that time was terrible for me. I was crying almost every day and couldn’t stop. Briefly - my mental health collapsed. I started having heavy $u!c!dal thoughts etc. I was so sure he would stay. I decided not to extend the contract for the room I used to rent; because of that I had to look for a new room super fast. I didn’t apply for a master’s in his city because I was so sure he would stay here. This makes me feel like it’s all my fault we didn’t close the distance. I still blame myself.\n\nAfter some weeks I went to Spain to visit him. It was fine, but the last day of my stay was the worst of all the last days I’ve ever had. I have to mention that every time on the day of my flight home I was crying like crazy and I couldn’t calm myself down at all. However, for more or less half a year it’s been even worse. I feel like the worst shit. For me it’s like being dragged out of my safe zone. I’m completely stressed and anxious. It’s like total panic and nothing helps me. I tried some breathing or grounding exercises and even hydroxyzine, and nothing helps. So, coming back to the very last visit. Before the visit I’d already felt depressed, but after coming back I couldn’t eat, I was crying all day, even in public places because I couldn’t hold it. I just wanted to stop existing. I still feel really stressed, anxious and depressed, but now I am able to hold back my crying - or I just cried all my tears out. This week I’m seeing the doctor so he can prescribe me some medicine for my mental state.\n\nI feel so lonely and disappointed. My boyfriend is looking for a job now and probably until next year he won’t be able to come (because at the beginning it’s not possible to take days off). What’s more, in my city they are renovating the airport and it’s boing to be closed for more than a month (don’t tell me to try other airports. I can’t skip classes anymore and flying from another airport means traveling all day).\n\nI’m coming to Spain in 2 weeks. Later we can see each other at Christmas. I know some couples wait longer to see each other, but I can’t stand it anymore. In order to see each other I have to skip my birthday and Christmas in my hometown. I feel so unequal because last year he was doing an internship and I was the person who was coming (and at that time there was no direct flight. I was always so stressed with the travels). I had to reschedule my work and skip classes in order to see him. Now, I’m trying to go on Erasmus to his city for next year. I understand that in his case it’s not possible to visit me that frequently and that he works to earn for our future, but still, I think I sacrifice a lot for him and the relationship. Most of all - my mental health.\n\nI’m worried that if it happens that we break up, I will end up with nothing. He lives with his parents so he doesn’t need to pay rent unlike me. Most of what he earns he saves. His mental health is more than fine.  \nI don’t know what to do. I just can’t stand it. I don’t even have anybody to hug me during this hard time. There is no finishing date. Everything is uncertain. If I won't make it to Erasmus we will have to be in LDR for another 2 years. I'm enough of it.

I want to preface this that what she is going through is truly one of the worst things a person can go through especially since we are so young. I can see her shutting down and being emotionally drained and it breaks my heart. I want to be there for her and I also want to give her the space she needs to process. What I am going through is nothing in comparison to her grief, I know this, but I wanted to know how people can get through the silence and agony of not being able to physically be there for someone at a time like this. We both still love each other and she has her moments where she’ll be smiling and laughing but I know grief comes in waves. So this is followed by days of crying and sleeping. We went from checking in and calling and spending time together over the phone or discord to now I hear from her once in the day and then maybe some time at night when she’s awake. I really feel selfish even being sad about not seeing her, but I can’t reach out to anyone I know because they either dismiss how I’m feeling as being too emotional, or they outright doubt my relationship because it’s long distance.

We’ve been talking for 10 months now. I live in Europe he lives in the US. At the start of the year he told me if we were ever to be together it would take quite some time, maybe even 2 years… he’s at a point in his life where he doesn’t know what to do… whether to go back to university and get a masters degree, change career or move back home (he wasn’t born in the US). \n\nHe’s also aware that after I graduate my plans were to try and study in the US (I’ve always wanted to do this prior to meeting him, also to clarify, my intention isn’t just to date/talk to a guy from the US with the hopes of a green card before anyone suggests this). \n\nAnyway, recently he told me he’s not ready for a relationship and I’ve been pushing him towards one and it’s making him freak out as he’s only been divorced a few years (he told me he ended things). That he’s enjoying being single etc because he can focus on his happiness and he doesn’t have to be responsible for anyone else’s (I admit there’s times where I’ve been clingy wondering why he hasn’t responded or if he’s talking to other women) he told me he’s not looking for a relationship or talking to anyone else but if he was ready for one, I would be his only choice and that there’s nobody else.\n\nCut a long story short - I called his bluff, I told him I was going to start dating other guys and that we could be friends if he was open to that. He agreed but he was very distant afterwards, it ended up in an argument and I asked him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore and he said not if we’re arguing so I told him it’s best we don’t talk and he started asking if I was for real etc. \n\nBefore he told me he didn’t miss anyone and didn’t get easily emotionally attached to anyone, not even his ex wife which is why he left her. Weeks ago told me he rarely misses people as a response to me saying I missed him. After our argument and after I said it’s best we don’t talk he told me he thinks about me throughout his day and that he misses me and if I left he would miss me a lot and that he doesn’t want things to end. \n\nI feel like this is a big thing him finally opening up to me but still I have so much to decide upon, he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship but treats it like we’re in one. Maybe I’m just too overbearing at times… I’ve been used to being lied to and cheated on that I don’t trust easily and sometimes when he goes quiet I will assume the worst. He told me he likes his own space and his ex wife never used to give him that which is part of the reason he doesn’t want a relationship.\n\nI don’t know if he will change his mind and I’m probably dumb for waiting around but after our argument I feel like I need him in my life.

On New Year’s Eve, while drunk, he defined our dynamic by saying, “you understand this is just benefits right?.” I went along with it, but since there has been more couple like or at least intimate activities such as cooking dinner together, traveling, staying over weekly, spending holidays together, day trips, sentimental gifts etc.\n\nA few weeks ago, after we booked a weekend trip, he told me about a conversation he’d had with his best friend. He told me that his friend said, “So you're sleeping together and are now travelling together, so you're dating, right?\". He then told me that he responded to his friend, saying, \"Oh no no no,\" with the friend saying, \"okay well does she know that?\". He then said, \"Oh, she insisted.\" Basically, he lied to his friend, saying that I was the one who insisted it wasn't dating even though that's not true at all, and he's the one who has repeatedly insisted otherwise. \n\nHe placed the responsibility on me. I didn’t even know how to respond when he told me I just sat there in shock. I felt like he'd just thrown me under the bus. After he told me that, he said a few times unconvincingly, \"You did... you did.\" I could even tell he didn't believe that. \n\nThis really bothered me.

But somehow, because we were both in the stage, and because we sort of traded off being the one with the stress, it somehow felt okay.\n\nNow, I have been working full time since graduating in 2019, and I have been pretty even keel for a number of years. I don't really have as much emotional turmoil anymore, and just want to enjoy life and be happy. By contrast, he has continued doing degrees and has had some pretty challenging mental health episodes, and also seems pretty negative a lot of the time.\n\nIn terms of common interests and activities, our relationship is better than ever: we have really enjoyed climbing together, playing magic, and other shared activities.\n\nHowever, there are three main challenges:\n\nOne, sexually: I am, and always have been, consistently vocal and expressive regarding my attraction to my partner, and very complimentary of his appearance and who he is. I also am regularly the person initiating sex: he rarely initiates and does not seem bothered by extended lack. I would like to have sex more regularly, but also get down about always being the person to suggest it and always being the only one expressing attraction. He compliments me so very rarely. Even when it would be expected (e.g., dressing up for a formal occasion), he usually does not compliment me. This has been something I have raised many times over the years, and it's a difference that hurts. If it matters at all, we are both pretty fit and healthy, and in many ways we are fitter now than when we were younger.\n\nTwo, negativity: He is very bright and gregarious with others, but when it just he and I, he is so negative. There are complaints about everything, from minor inconveniences (eg waiting in a line) to major world issues (eg inflation). The constant complaints and bitter negativity makes me feel like, wow he hates our life together. I'm not the sunniest person myself, but I enjoy our life and I want to make the best of things.\n\nThird, guilt: Over the past couple years, because of these differences, I have started to imagine a bit more what life might be like on my own, potentially dating someone who might seem a bit more like they want me and want to be with me. This fills me with guilt, and it fills me with panic. I like so much of our life, but the imbalances described above weigh on me.\n\nThanks for reading this far. Guess I'm just looking for some outside perspectives.\n\nTL;DR : partner (36M) of 15 years is often negative and doesn't express sexual interest in me (35F).

During one of our arguments I expressed that due to our lack of quality time, I was afraid our relationship wouldn’t be able to grow/change as we do as individuals to which he responded with “well I don’t plan on changing anytime soon”.\n\nAll these things combined make me worry that he thinks since we moved in together he doesn’t need to put any more effort into the relationship, despite me expressing my dissatisfaction with the effort he puts into our relationship.\n\nBasically in the forefront of my mind, I want to breakup with him because I am truly not happy in this relationship and I’ve stopped seeing a future with him. He doesn’t seem to put in effort into fixing any issues that arise in conflict, or trying to grow our relationship.\n\nUnfortunately, we do live together and have a lease that doesn’t end for about 7 more months, however in 5 months we would need to give our notice for moving out.

On paper, everything is amazing: we laugh a lot, never fight, we live together really well, intimacy is good, and our lives fit together almost perfectly. I love her a lot — my life is truly better because of her presence.\n\nThe problem is that for the past year, I’ve been feeling a constant doubt. I miss a certain spark or sense of attraction. For example, when we talk about booking vacations or making future plans, I sometimes feel resistance rather than excitement. It’s confusing, because I know how good we are together, yet I can’t shake this feeling.\n\nWe’ve already tried a lot: I’ve seen a psychologist to see if it was something personal, we’ve done relationship coaching, and even took a 2-month time-out living separately under guidance of the coach. We communicate well about it, and we both don’t want to throw away something that works. But the doubt just doesn’t go away.\n\nOne thing to note is that I’ve never been in another long-term relationship before, and I’m kind of scared the same thing would happen with anyone else in the future.\n\nAnother factor: we own a house together. Breaking up would mean selling or moving out, which is a huge financial and practical hurdle. That makes the decision feel even more final, even though I know it shouldn’t be any factor.\n\nPart of me thinks: this is just what long-term relationships are, the “in love” feeling fades. But another part of me thinks: if I haven’t felt “yes, this is it” for almost a year, maybe that’s telling me something important.\n\nI’m torn between staying (and risking that this doubt will always linger), or ending it (and risking regret because I’d be giving up someone amazing).\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you decide whether the absence of spark was something you could live with, or a sign to move on?\n\n**TL;DR:** Been with my girlfriend (25F) for 5.5 years (me 29M). Relationship is great on paper (no fights, good intimacy, fun together), and I love her a lot, but I’ve been doubting for about a year because I miss the spark/attraction. We tried therapy, coaching (including a 2-month break guided by a coach), but the doubt doesn’t go away. We also own a house together, which makes breaking up feel like a huge and final step.

Coming back, I didn’t feel excited to see him and when I walked through the doors it was lack luster. He had let plants die that I asked him to water, he hadn’t gone grocery shopping- so there was no food in the house, and it appeared that no chores got done.

OR does this feel like something that should be given the effort to try to repair? I’m feeing such a weight on my shoulders with being stuck between letting go and holding on. \n\nTLDR; 5 year Relationship is fizzling despite there being a lot of love still there. But an imbalance of finances and household responsibilities is causing me to feel detached. How to work up the nerve to end things OR is it worth trying to repair?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/aMFingINTP_1795", "user": "u/aMFingINTP", "text": "I (37m) keep feeling neglected by my partner (29f) and it's starting to get to me.\n\nI'm a 37 year old autistic. I was diagnosed level 1 (\"closer to level 2 than being not autistic at all\") which means that I struggle with a lot of miscommunication between me and others. I've gotten used to this. I also have depression and ADHD, but these impact my life much less. I'm employed full-time (I switch jobs several times a year and it can be difficult for me to remain employed, but I always pay my rent), working tech support overnight for public safety agencies (hospitals, fire departments, 911 dispatchers, etc.).\n\nMy therapist has suggested that I have something called Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is apparently an autism profile characterized by flashes of upset/anger when perceiving demands/tasks. So when someone asks me to do something, I tend to get immediately upset for ten or so seconds, but then it subsides. I've gotten used to saying yes, or 'I love you' as a response because I don't want my irritation to prevent me from doing things or being good to the people around me. The other theory is, since I have severe idiopathic hypersomnia (basically narcolepsy), that I might get flashes of frustration because I'm always so tired. It's difficult to say.\n\nMy partner is 29 and is in her fourth year of med school to become a doctor. She has very symptomic ADHD that may or may not be causing a rift that I don't know how to work with. She also has POTS and some kind of connective tissue problem that means her joints are constantly in pain. The only real relief is a massage, but she can't do a lot of it herself because it'll hurt her wrist joint. Not massaging her is mean, because she is actively in significant pain, and I knew these things about her prior to agreeing to the relationship.\n\nThe issue is potentially the ADHD.\n\nWe'd been courting for 6 months before we decided to move forward with a relationship. We chatted a lot in a discord roleplay server, and I asked if it was okay to flirt with her. She was over the moon about it. I moved from the pacific northwest to the hotter parts of the US, and we got an apartment together. We've been living together since June 2024.\n\nSince December 2024 (almost ten months now), her attention has waned significantly. She got into a mobile game that she hyperfixated on, and then into some discord servers that resemble old AIM group chats, and it became a problem. I would try to talk to her, would do a bid for connection, and she wouldn't reply. Like she didn't hear me. If I got her attention, it would be partial as she would be on her phone, too.\n\nI'm older than her and also less attractive. She's from a wealthy family and I was raised in poverty (starvation in government housing, but no homelessness as a child). We're very different people as far as our lives go, but we have a lot in common and like a lot of the same things. We're politically similar, we like the same stuff in bed, and our humor overlaps. \n\nThe issue is that it's been a struggle to get her attention and I'm struggling not to take it personally. I've googled ADHD issues in relationships and it seems like this could easily be an ADHD symptom, but I don't know how to handle that. Before I went into tech, I went to school to become a therapist. I can't ignore the mental health aspect, but I don't know how to not be hurt by the change in dynamic.\n\nI've told her that it's okay if we're not compatible, and that I won't hate her if it doesn't work out--we started out as friends so it's not like there's no foundation here. I also try to be supportive, but I find myself being so upset lately. Additionally, a side effect of having autism is a flat affect, so I don't emote a lot in the face and my tone stays pretty neutral. All of this is often perceived by others as me being grumpy, which I'm sure doesn't help her ADHD. A lot of people with ADHD have rejection sensitive dysphoria and I fear that I probably trigger that a lot.\n\nI don't really know what to do, I'm kind of at my wits end. We just argued for two hours and that's why I'm running here. We've argued almost every day this week and I'm becoming emotionally fatigued. Her libido is much higher than mine and I'm struggling to be as affectionate or sexual as her because I feel disliked. This is becoming an issue for her, too, as she's not feeling attractive or desirable lately as a result of me withdrawing.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll leave it here.\n\nDoes anyone have some insight or recommendations?\n\ntl;dr: gf has ADHD and I'm feeling really ignored and lonely. Could use some support or guidance. I'm an emotionally introverted person and she's more extroverted and physical. Both of us feel neglected.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We were planning on being official next weekend. He has been wanting to do a girlfriend proposal. We’ve know each other for years but lived separate lives in different relationships until we reconnected. I had an amazing weekend with him just to find out the day after he has a Peru trip that’s happening way sooner than we knew. It would happen a few days after becoming official and he wouldn’t be back until next year. It’s for family business and he’d be able to come visit for a few weekends during these few months. I’m open to still trying it out but he’s more apprehensive and overthinking. He thinks it’ll be unfair to me that he will be busy. But he says he wants to still facetime, flirt, be sexual, and do all the things we already do without the title. \n\nThat’s where I put my foot down and told him he can’t expect me to give him girlfriend treatment if he’s wanting me to be loyal and committed to him as a friend. He demanded no seeing others and everything. How can I approach this with him? Do I just cut it off completely and not see him one last time before he leaves on the 17th? Should we just wait until he’s back from his trip or do we keep trying? We both feel overwhelmed and on two different pages. I’m willing but he’s unsure. I want this to work and he does too. It just feels like terrible timing. \n\nTL;DR! I (22f) need advice on if I should pursue (23m) who will be in a different country for a couple of months for family business?
