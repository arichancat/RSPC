It all was nice… (3 years ago) Ngl I still would love and be with him if he would, but contacts are apart and he said he doesnt wants relationship w me no more (i asked him last year…) The reason why he broke up w me was:\n\n•\t⁠my appereance (too much piercing and tattoo, got them later on when i was w him)\n•\t⁠he wouldnt manage it to live w me together bcs he is poor and its hard to manage him to live w me. Cames out, he now lives alone -_- ( also its easy to live togetehr, more cheap)\n\nIdk… he can have different gf now… better one :(\n\nBut after him, i had 2 more other ldr relationship. Consisted of gaslighting and only wanting nudes… It made me psychically sick. They both broke up w me.\n\nAnd now im with someone… I feel like, im never right, he blames me all the time, he doesnt talks about meeting me or wanting to have a life w me. Tbh we dont know nothing really about each other i only know he has a daughter and bla bla… Ok, but ngl… he is horny 24/7 and talks about norhing. If i talk about any topic he turns everything in sexual way like jeez im so tired. He also is someone who told me my exes treated me bad and he would never do the nudes things, but comes out, he is saying after we had arguments via online that my exes treated me right and no wonder they despited me etc. and he really overdo it w nudes. Once i also accidentally mentioned marriage and he said he is divorced but she didnt signed it so actually he is still married lol. And she will never sign it he said. Means he wouldnt be even able to ever marry me. Also, prob this child which he already has, is already enough for him… dunno. I cant have a normal convo w him cus yh… he ignors and rather sends his dick.\n\nIm often think about my 1st ex… he was so genuine…🥹\n\nI to be honest am so depressive , i am on antidepressants, i just feel like, i dont wanna waste my time.

Obviously they didn't do anything, i was there but they would \"joke\" about selling them their feet or a slip for money.

But somehow, because we were both in the stage, and because we sort of traded off being the one with the stress, it somehow felt okay.\n\nNow, I have been working full time since graduating in 2019, and I have been pretty even keel for a number of years. I don't really have as much emotional turmoil anymore, and just want to enjoy life and be happy. By contrast, he has continued doing degrees and has had some pretty challenging mental health episodes, and also seems pretty negative a lot of the time.\n\nIn terms of common interests and activities, our relationship is better than ever: we have really enjoyed climbing together, playing magic, and other shared activities.\n\nHowever, there are three main challenges:\n\nOne, sexually: I am, and always have been, consistently vocal and expressive regarding my attraction to my partner, and very complimentary of his appearance and who he is. I also am regularly the person initiating sex: he rarely initiates and does not seem bothered by extended lack. I would like to have sex more regularly, but also get down about always being the person to suggest it and always being the only one expressing attraction. He compliments me so very rarely. Even when it would be expected (e.g., dressing up for a formal occasion), he usually does not compliment me. This has been something I have raised many times over the years, and it's a difference that hurts. If it matters at all, we are both pretty fit and healthy, and in many ways we are fitter now than when we were younger.\n\nTwo, negativity: He is very bright and gregarious with others, but when it just he and I, he is so negative. There are complaints about everything, from minor inconveniences (eg waiting in a line) to major world issues (eg inflation). The constant complaints and bitter negativity makes me feel like, wow he hates our life together. I'm not the sunniest person myself, but I enjoy our life and I want to make the best of things.\n\nThird, guilt: Over the past couple years, because of these differences, I have started to imagine a bit more what life might be like on my own, potentially dating someone who might seem a bit more like they want me and want to be with me. This fills me with guilt, and it fills me with panic. I like so much of our life, but the imbalances described above weigh on me.\n\nThanks for reading this far. Guess I'm just looking for some outside perspectives.\n\nTL;DR : partner (36M) of 15 years is often negative and doesn't express sexual interest in me (35F). Yet we enjoy many other activities together.\n\nAre there others who have experienced similar situations?

Why do I feel this way and what does it mean?\n\nHey everyone. I'm in desperate need for some relationship advice. I 23M and my girlfriend 25F have been together for almost two years. We moved into an apartment at 1 year as it made sense for both of us money wise and we just wanted to be with each other more. \n\nIn the beginning, we were very physical and touchy. Affection was not a problem for either of us. But now at two years. I'm no longer interested in sex and I'm extremely unaffectionate. I work shift work (7pm-7am) and I'm on anti depressants. So when we have off time together I just wanna relax and do nothing as I'm exhausted. She on the other hand is very affectionate and she's starting to have some issues of not feeling loved/cared for. I completely understand why she's feeling this way. I use to be affectionate in the beginning. But after getting this job (which I've only had for a year) I've become a different person basically. I have also started going to therapy but have only had 1 session with my next being in 2 weeks.\n\nAnother thing I'm struggling with is I feel like I'm looking for validation/affection from outside my relationship. Our joint friend group has a couple single females in it and I feel part of me wanting to hangout with them more. I feel like I'm looking at a \"grass is greener\" situation and don't know how to stop that feeling. I'd never act on anything well in a relationship either. \n\nThe reason I'm seeking advice is because I really don't know what to do. Am I losing feelings or am I just out of that honeymoon phase and looking for the adrenaline feeling of a new relationship. Why do I now not feel affectionate with my girlfriend like I use too. And what could I do to regain that spark back. Shes very affectionate and open to trying stuff to make me more affectionate. I also care about her deeply hence why I'm making this post. I wanna figure this out. \n\nI definitely can give more info if needed. Figured this would be a good starting ground and people could give me some advice \n\nTL;DR: I'm not affectionate towards my girlfriend and I think I might be losing feelings.

{"id": "u/CandyTemporary7074_1604", "user": "u/CandyTemporary7074", "text": "Two years after breakup. These lessons changed me completely.\n\nIt has been almost two years since the day my relationship ended. I still remember sitting on the floor of my apartment that night with my phone in my hand waiting for a message that never came. I replayed every detail in my head like I was trying to rewrite the ending. Every corner of the city felt haunted. Even the songs I used to love felt poisoned.\n\nAround that time I watched my favorite Rohmer movie *Conte d’hiver*. The way the main character held onto love with almost spiritual devotion hit me hard. That was me. My love had become an obsession, almost like a religion. Regret turned into a daily ritual. I analyzed every moment like scripture, asking myself what I had done wrong. It consumed me. But over time that obsession started to shape me. It didn’t just hurt, it forced me to rebuild my life piece by piece and become a better version of myself.\n\nI learned that heartbreak is real pain, not just in your mind. Neuroscience shows rejection activates the same brain areas as physical injury. That’s why my chest felt like it was tearing open every morning. Guy Winch’s TED Talk on emotional first aid reminded me to treat a broken heart like a broken bone. I stopped pretending I was fine. I cried when I needed to, journaled when the noise got loud, and reached out to friends instead of isolating. That honesty became the first step in healing.\n\nSelf-compassion became my anchor. Kristin Neff’s work showed that people who treat themselves kindly recover faster. At first it felt fake to tell myself “you are doing your best.” But slowly it worked. The shame eased. Writing also became medicine. I wrote short entries about values I wanted to carry forward and red flags I ignored. That turned regret into a plan instead of a prison.\n\nSleep nearly broke me. My nights were restless until I tried Andrew Huberman’s simple tools, morning sunlight, physiological sighs, and non-sleep deep rest. Movement and light helped reset my body. Learning about oxytocin and dopamine explained why I felt like I was going through withdrawal. It wasn’t weakness. It was biology. That realization made it easier to replace the old bond with new routines like working out, volunteering, and building friendships.\n\nBooks & podcasts became my teachers. Attached by Amir Levine is a bestseller that made me rethink how I show up in relationships. This book will make you question everything you think you know about love. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk is the best healing book I’ve ever read. It shows how the body stores grief and gives tools to release it. Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin podcast made me feel less alone listening to couples work through real struggles. Huberman Lab gave me science I could actually apply to my sleep and mood. The School of Life YouTube channel offered short bursts of philosophy that kept me grounded when I was tempted to spiral. And a friend pushed me toward daily expressive journaling. That practice helped me turn obsession into lessons I could use. Also my friend recommended me BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It takes books, expert talks, and research and turns them into personalized podcasts. You choose the length and even the host’s voice. I picked a smoky Samantha-from-Her style voice that made the episodes feel intimate. One session blended Esther Perel’s interviews, Gottman Institute research, and neuroscience on bonding. It explained why I was still reaching for my phone at midnight and gave me concrete steps to break the cycle. Reading helped me more than therapy ever did. Honestly. \n\nAttachment theory also gave me clarity. Esther Perel’s talks made me see how my anxious tendencies shaped the relationship. I began practicing “secure” behaviors like setting boundaries and being direct. For the first time I realized regret could be fuel instead of a chain.\n\nAlmost two years later the pain is no longer sharp. What started as obsession has shaped me into someone stronger, clearer, and more secure. I don’t carry the loss like a religion anymore. I’m ready to say goodbye. And I want to thank my ex, for being the reason I learned how to rebuild my life.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "INSOMNIA", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We’ve been together for 6 years. She’s loyal, caring, thoughtful, and lovely with my family. I also get along very well with her family, who are genuinely lovely. Her dad is a kind man.\n\nBut I feel there’s a big lack of respect and fairness, especially around money:\n\n* I earn \\~£150k and pay for everything (rent, bills, food, outings, wedding deposit). She’s a high-earning lawyer but saves most of her money.\n* She went ahead and bought her parents a house without telling me, while we were looking for one together. She calls my flat “ugly” and says this is the lowest point of her life.\n* Her long-term plan is that I buy our marital home while she invests in her parents’ house. If we split, she keeps hers, but could still claim part of mine.\n* She forwarded me a £1,500 wedding bill (I’d already paid £500). When I asked why and to split, she got angry and hasn’t spoken to me for two days (today is the third).\n* She told me my mum should take a loan to help pay for our wedding. My mum works part-time, lives in a small flat with my brother, while my dad is divorced, disabled, and living with my grandma. This comment really broke me and if she after said she did not really mean it that was a joke, but still expects me to pay as she did not mention anything about splitting it.\n\nI know I’m not perfect. I can be sarcastic when frustrated, and I’ve been vocal about her brother because I feel he mostly benefits himself. Nobody is perfect. But I feel, especially in the past year, she is stingy, ungrateful, and doesn’t respect me.\n\nI love her and I love her family, but after 6 years I’m asking myself: if it feels like this now, will it only get worse after marriage?\n\n**Question:** Has anyone been in a similar position? How do you know when it’s time to walk away, even when your faith makes it so hard?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Lengthy version:**\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m a Catholic man (30) from the UK, engaged to a woman (32). We’ve been together for 6 years. I’ve always wanted a family and thought she was the one. I work hard, earn well (\\~£150k), and I’ve always been generous in relationships, maybe too much at times. She’s a good partner in many ways: loyal, caring, looks after me when I’m sick, gives thoughtful gifts, and gets along with my mum.\n\nBut lately I feel there is a lack of respect, especially around money, and I’m starting to question everything.\n\n# Finances and fairness\n\nFrom the start, I’ve covered nearly everything: rent, bills, food, outings. She’s a high-earning lawyer but saves most of her income and contributes very little. I’m saving for our first house and told her we either need a prenup and the house will me for us but only me as owner or we start splitting things fairly. If one day she stays home with kids, of course I’ll support her fully. But right now, it feels very one-sided and she does not seem to appreciate it. She says a prenup means I already expect divorce, which isn’t true. I just want fairness and respect.\n\n# Stories that made me worried\n\n* **When I needed help** Once, when I needed help with a house deposit, she told me to borrow from her brother instead of offering her savings. That stuck with me.\n* **Her house plan** Her long-term idea was that I buy our marital home, while she later buys a house for her parents to rent. That way, if things go badly, she keeps her investment fully, while legally she could still claim part of mine.\n* **Buying a house without me** She went ahead and bought her parents a house without telling me (FYI they already lived in a family owned house, just they wanted bigger one and cannot get mortgage because they are old), while we were also looking for one together. She keeps calling my flat small and ugly, said this was the lowest point of her life, and told me “all men provide for women.\", for context this is the best flat I had, I lived with flatmates before this, been almost homeless and moved 12 times in 8 years. Also about house chores, we do a good 50/50, maybe 60/40 on her doing the 60, but I have good robot hoover and mopper, washing machine, etc. and we pretty much split, she never cleans the toilet, mostly me and I rarely do dishes, mostly her.\n* **Wedding bill** We got a £1,500 bill for the venue (I had already paid £500 deposit, which will be wasted if we cancel the venue). She just forwarded it to me. When I asked why she didn’t handle it, she got angry. Since then, she has ignored me for two days instead of answering my question: “What are your expectations in this relationship?”\n* **The car mess** We used to have her dad’s petrol car. Then her brother swapped it with an EV, which made my commute a nightmare. I eventually bought my own petrol car just to cope. Now the EV sits unused, still costing expensive PCP debt, but she insists it counts as her “contribution.”\n* **Gifts and sacrifices** I’ve spoiled her with expensive gifts (Gucci, jewellery, makeup) and even took out a loan for her diamond ring. Meanwhile, she hasn’t made similar sacrifices for us.\n* **Her family** I’ve asked her not to give money to her brother without telling me first. She still does it behind my back or only after, which creates tension.\n\n# My part in this\n\nI know I’m not perfect. I can be sarcastic when I’m frustrated, and I’ve been vocal about her brother because I feel he mostly benefits himself. Maybe I don’t always communicate in the best way and I know I should not gossip on her brother, but she is against prenup and her money are a mystery to me, so even though I might have to focus on her and not her family, I did the mistake.\n\nBut I also believe nobody is perfect. In her case, I see that she can be very stingy with money, and lately she has been unrespectful and ungrateful.\n\nOne comment that really shook me was when she said my mum should take a loan to help pay for our wedding. My mum lives abroad, works part-time, and shares a small flat with my brother. My dad is divorced, disabled, and living with my grandma. I’ve been open with my fiancée about my family being poor, lower working class. For her to suggest my mum take on debt for our wedding really hurt, and it made me think seriously about breaking up.\n\n# Her family\n\nThis part makes it harder. We are very close to her family. We’ve gone on trips together, and they are genuinely lovely. They invite me every weekend for dinner or days at the beach. Her dad is a veteran and a kind man, but his daughter, my fiancée, feels entitled and lately disrespectful. I feel sad about the idea of rejecting her and, by extension, distancing myself from them. That is part of why I am writing this as if I was a father and she would be my daughter, it would make me sad that her fiancé broke up.\n\n# Where I’m at\n\nAfter 6 years together, I don’t want to make her sound all bad. She does have good qualities and I love her. But the financial imbalance, the lack of respect, and comments like the one about my mum feel bigger than just “little arguments.” If this is how things are now, I worry it will only get worse after marriage. Also, she moved in and I accepted her, even though she has a family here, I do not feel like asking her to leave, she threaten a few time she will leave forever and I told her to do so, she is free to do whatever she wants, but she is still here. I would look for this house and move myself if the situation does not work and she can to what she likes with this flat (probably will move to her parents if she needs to pay the rent and bills).\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? How do you know when it’s time to walk away, even when your faith makes it so hard?\n\nP.S. Everything I wrote she already knows it, so I did not write here something I did not tell her, I even told her about breaking up, that if she is so unhappy here she is not trapped, she is a free woman and can do whatever she wants. I know it's bad to say, but she being hostile, made me also hostile.

And that i wasn't going anywhere. I'd still stay in touch with her and be friends with her. But i cant lie man. This shit hurts.

[20F & 22M]\n\nMe \\[20f\\] and my partner \\[22m\\] are going through hardship. Our emotional connection is quite up and down. We have moments in time where we feel close and connected. We have moments where we feel less. We've been having a lot of hard conversations, especially with me talking to him about my needs and how I feel loved. We've had talks about saying true to his word. There was a situation where he stated that he would come over that night, and he didn't and this was the third night in a row. Obviously, I was completely upset over that because we are a long-distance couple and I was in his state, roughly 15 minutes away from him, staying with a friend at the time with a private room but I could understand his side, however it annoyed me due to the lack of being true to his word so I bought it up. He didn't need to come over but I just thought I would bring it up to him and we had a conversation about it, and we got McDonald's afterwards because it was quite an emotional conversation for him and I. I should also give some backstory. We've been dating for It's been six months now. We had a situation where he broke up with me due to him starting the ADF, Australian Defence Force. He thought our relationship couldn't do it, couldn't survive the Australian defense force, as he didn't know where his life was heading, and he was letting his overthinking get to him (his words). He cares about me a lot. He's committed to me. I'm committed to him. We love each other and we're having all these hard conversations about my sexual desire and attraction towards him. I feel that I want him, you know, pretty often. And he feels like he can't do it as much as I want and that's completely fine but we have run to a point where I'm starting to question the attraction and my understanding of it.\n\nUnfortunately, I was neglected as a child, so I have unfortunately had a unhealthy way of expressing my desire to be wanted through intimacy. I want to fix that by trying to lower my desire, and I am trying to explore therapy. But I want to know if, what way can, as a long-distance couple, can we connect besides desire, sexual desire and how we can connect more? We've been in a rhythm of playing video games, we've been in a rhythm of watching shows as well, and it's all the same stuff. Which I feel has burnt out, and it's not fun? anymore, it's kinda routine?. Which is completely fine, I know relationships go through hard patches, but I am very committed to this guy. We had a situation yesterday where I sent him an \"inspirational photo\" (I asked before I sent), and he said didn't feel the same way that he would normally. He said that it was attractive, and that it felt different because normally it would always be on his mind, and normally he would want to do something after that. But he didn't, and he brought it up to me and we had a conversation about it, and he felt that he was a bad partner as he feels he is having troubles with his consistency and he feels he owes so much to me for breaking up with me but I am trying to express to him that he is not a bad partner, and that it is okay but I also feel like I have said some wrong things when communicating because I feel sometimes my insecurities come out as well, and sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough because I always communicate openly to him about everything and because of that I feel like the amount of hard conversations we have had puts a lot of pressure on him, and I feel like I have caused him to feel this way and that hurts. I'm trying to just come to Reddit or any source that I can to get any, I guess, information or seek clarity, see what people did. He also expressed that when we were in person, he had some moments where it felt the same way. So I'm not too sure what to do. But he's also reassured me that he's never done anything with me like that where he didn't want to.\n\n\n\nWhat are your comments? Thoughts? Opinions?

We’ve stayed in touch for 9 years, and I’m wondering if I should move on, or see if she still feels the same?\n\nI’ve never posted on Reddit before, so bear with me. I think this will be a long post, so I’ll give a summary and then get into the details \n\nHere’s the long story short. It sounds completely crazy, but I swear it was love at first sight. I’ve had really strong instant connections with other people in the past, but nothing has ever compared to this. It was like I’d always known her, like I knew her the way I know myself. We had a very short and intensely deep relationship (about 3 months), but unfortunately both of us had dealt with a lot of hard things in life, and had a lot of growing to do as people. When we broke up, she told me that she thought I was perfect, but didn’t feel she was in a place in life where she was ready for a relationship this intense, and that she didn’t want to mess it up. She said that one day when she was ready, she would let me know, and it would be up to me at that point to decide if it was still what I wanted. I completely felt the same, and we went our separate ways. We’ve stayed in touch off and on throughout the years, and have been talking a bit more recently. In the last couple months, we both ended up having relationships end with long term partners (mine 4Y, hers 6y on and off). We are planning on seeing each other when visiting home for the holidays, and I’m wondering if I should bring it up, or is it time to move on? \n\nHere’s where I’ll give more details. The last time we really hung out in person was right before I met my most recent ex, and she was not currently seeing her previous partner (they were on and off throughout the years). At this time I was visiting home, and we ended up hanging out for 3 days straight. We met at a bar and were admittedly drinking a fair amount, and I asked her if she still meant what she said all those years ago. She told me that she did mean it, and apologized if she had come across inconsistently in her feelings. We went back to my hotel and stayed up all night talking about getting married, and even picked several potential wedding dates. She was in school at the time, and I lived in a different city, so we agreed that it still wasn’t the right time for us, but that once she finished school we would try to work things out. I left feeling ecstatic, I thought we were really going to give things a shot. \n\nSo Reddit, this is where all of our hearts break. When I got back from my trip, she sent me a message saying that she was sorry, but that she had been talking with (previous partner) and felt like she really needed to give it another chance. I was crushed to say the least, and we didn’t talk for several years after this. I felt like I’d kind of made a fool of myself, and told myself I needed to move on. \n\nSo here’s the thing. I am a heavily science-minded person. I have spent years psychoanalyzing the way that I feel about this, talking myself in and out of it, rationalizing, but there’s some things that just can’t be explained. The first one is the strangest. When we initially broke up, I could not stop thinking about her, and I eventually decided to un-add her on all social media so I wouldn’t have a reminder/notifications when she posted. I got to the point where I would go months at a time without thinking about her at all, but every time, without fail, I would then have a dream about her. It was always some variation of the same thing, us hanging out, and her eventually telling me not to give up on her. And every time, she would text me the next day. FOR YEARS. The other thing is, even though I could go some time without thinking about her, my feelings have never gone away even a little bit. I’ve for sure been in love with other people in the past, heartbroken even (which is confusing), but the feelings always fade after some time passes. For whatever reason though, 9 years later, I still feel that same way I did on day one. \n\nAnd here are my last few points (if you’ve made it this far, thank you). I mentioned that recently we’ve been in touch again, and when we talk it’s like no time has passed at all. We literally had an 11 hour phone call, and I never wanted it to end. It always feels so natural, and I laugh, and I feel understood, and I’m excited to hear everything she has to say. We’ve also sent some gifts back and forth in the mail (we both just had birthdays), and the things I received made me feel more seen than I have in a long time. The most compelling thing though is as we’ve been talking I can tell we have both grown a lot now. We’ve both been to therapy, moved away from home, started working towards big career goals, and reflected on ourselves. We want the same things out of life (talked about kids, money, housing, relationships, etc.) and I just can’t help but feel like she is truly my soulmate. \n\nHowever, it’s true that she has been inconsistent throughout the years (a lot of times understandably, but still), and I know that she knows how I feel, so I can’t help but think that if she still wanted this she would say something. We also live decently far away from each other now, and I am currently in college (went back to school a few years ago). AND we also just got out of long term relationships, and it feels a little messy. I know the truth is that I would have to get to know her all over again, and all of this is pretty much a gamble on a short relationship I had when I was 17. \n\nSo Reddit, is it worth bringing it up again when I go home for Christmas, or is it time to move on?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She leaves the house right before I get home from work, and comes in and goes directly to bed.  Or locks the door when she is in the guest room.  She what will not respond to even simple texts like when I update her that I am on my way home, unless it's \"okay\" only.\n\nWe have been married just shy of 1 year, together for about 7 years.\n\nFor the days leading up to this, she has been excessively clingy and wants me to plan every part of her day.  I don't say this to disperse, but she expects me to plan every meal, and if I am a little bit later than a predetermined time limit that she didn't tell me then she will either go out and get food, or refuse to eat entirely.  She also is begging me to hang out with her, but I already spend basically every moment of the day with her (we work in the same building, but have different employers).  I am generally okay with this, but just being near her isn't enough.  I tried to play a video game with her the other day, but she seemed distressed and was taking it out on me. Bumping into her character in-game and knocking her off a ledge caused her to stop responding to me and was silent for about 15 minutes.\n\nWhen I ask her what is wrong she will only say \"I'm fine.\", and when I press and say \"you have been acting different for a while, I'm worried.\" She will figure to act like I'm crazy for bringing it up. \n\nWe had plans to go do an activity at the end of the weekend, and she became upset that I was on my phone just before it and went to bed early on the afternoon.  I asked her if she still wanted to go, and she refused, so I went anyway since I desperately needed something to distract me after a hard weekend of being given the cold shoulder while also being accused of not \"hanging out\".

Honestly, our relationship has been pretty close to perfect. I’ve been in toxic relationships before, and he’s the complete opposite of anything I’ve known. I'm super close with his family and they treat me so lovely compared to mine own. We communicate well, we make time for each other, and while we do have the occasional disagreement, we always resolve it the same day and never let resentment build up.\n\nAbout a year ago, we took a big step and moved to a different state together. And while we’re living in a tiny, not-so-great apartment, I’ve never been happier doing life with him.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky: a few weeks ago, his company unfortunately shut down. While he’s not too stressed about finding work again, he has plenty of opportunities, it turns out he might be getting an offer from a major company in the U.S. If that happens, he’d likely need to move there (we are from AUS)\n\nI’m genuinely so proud and excited for him, but at the same time, I have no idea what this means for *us*. We’ve talked and cried about it (both of us in tearS) and we’re just at a loss. We love each other deeply, but this is such a huge, life-altering decision.\n\nI would never stop him from chasing his dreams, and I do believe we could make long distance work if we really tried. I don’t know anything about visas or how that process would even work, but I imagine we could figure it out over time as well. That said, there’s also the fear: what if I eventually move over there and things don’t work out? What if we put so much into this and it still falls apart?\n\nI’m also still in the early stages of my career compared to him, which makes everything feel even more uncertain.

I'm debating the relationship with him because while he checks all my boxes (we laugh together, I love his sense of humor, can have intellectual conversations, I'm attracted to him, similar lifestyle and aspirations, he is smart and has a great career, handsome), our relationship can feel like we're friends or bro's about half of the time. Firstly, the most important aspect of this is that I know that he cares about me and he has expressed so and his actions show that he cares. However, he is very particular and needs things done in a certain way, as well as sometimes turning up his nose to doing silly things or even things like me touching his thigh while driving because it feels in masculine. He is also very weird about bodily functions and sometimes acts disgusted by things like womanly cycles on clothes. In the bedroom it is great just lacking the experimental nature I usually enjoy. I think he is down to do maybe 70% of what I am interested in, but this is a big part if a relationship for me so I would want more. \n\nHe never calls me pet names except while we're in the act of sleeping together because he says he just doesn't do that. We also have had conversations about how there may be something missing, and that while he is satisfied with a few texts a day, I want more talking and just generally a lot more deeper conversations and words. I think where I'm struggling is that I am a deeply independent person, but I just want to feel loved too. My job is high powered and stressful with a lot of responsibilities that deeply fulfill me, so in a partnership I want to feel adored and simply be able to have the small little things like kisses and compliments. I feel like the only way to feel connection with him is through physical touch and sometimes discussions about things, but there are no future plans and we both admitted that we love each other but are not \"in love\" yet.  \n\nAnother issue is lack of emotional leadership. I brought up exclusivity which he was happy about, but I was hoping he would take the next step into asking me to be his gf. Which I was not because we never called each other that. That only semi happened when we were having a discussion last month and I brought this up. To which he shyly said that he would like that.  So we were essentially exclusive and committed to each other sans title. I'm not blaming him for being shy, but he is a very boisterous man and says his mind so feeling like there's no emotional leadership from his end feels quite empty. I also think sometimes he can be pretentious, and I don't like feeling like he will turn his nose up at something randomly. He was considering moving to another area for a job and we would have broken up then but he stayed, and a small part of me wishes that I wouldn't have to make the decision and it would have just been made for me in this way. \n\nI care about him deeply, really respect him, and he feels like a dear part of my life, but I am just perhaps looking for advice on what this means and is this enough to walk away? I know he cares and he's shown up for me over and over, but I feel lonely in a lot of ways and like I need a greater quantity of affection then he enjoys giving, Not sure if that is a weak reason to have doubts. I'd appreciate any insights! \n\nTLDR - A guy (28m) checks all my (29f) boxes but is a bit pretentious and lacks emotional leadership.

We're from the same small town in Georgia, but I now live 4.5 hours away. Despite the distance, we've stayed super connected: visit one another every weekend, constant texting, and nightly calls.

I've helped some financially.\n* Dramatic legal battle with stepmother over misappropriated funds from her dad; lots of lawyer meetings.\n\nDespite all this, and despite my repeated asking and reassurance, she's never leaned on me for support. Eventually, I've had no choice but to just trust her when she said she was fine.\n\nRecently, during a couple of moments of poor judgment, I voiced concerns about her 18-year-old son who lives with her. He's immature, rude, disrespectful, and messy—I expressed doubts about relocating to live in that environment (phrased very carefully, not harshly at all, I promise).\n\nImmediately, things cooled: texts halved, some days with minimal contact beyond good morning/goodnight.

He knows I have hookups. We're in a medium-distance, I used to see him 3 to 4 days a week but in July he moved for work and now its about once a month that'll see him. On his days off he'll go home and see his family, which due to family issues he'd rather I wasn't there for. So when l see him its after work and then I'll leave in morning.\n\nWe've been together almost 18 months, and we're at the point where I'm starting to want a deeper commitment but I really feel like that's not going to happen for a while.

My friend recently got married, and included me in the wedding party. She mentioned how her fiancé had an older half-brother. I asked to see a picture, and he was cute. We brought the joke to her fiancé a couple of times, but he downplayed it and said I wouldn’t be his “brother type,” which he had no right to say when he tried to pair me up with a guy whose type is blondes, and I’m not one until I feel like being one, if you know what I mean (wigs). So casually, I started downplaying my interest, but when my friend was planning the wedding, she told me, “You and him are going to walk together.” Months go by, and the wedding is here. \n\nFor the rehearsal, we met at her church to practice. I noticed he was looking at me here and there, but didn't get a chance to talk to me until we were practicing our walk. He would try to initiate conversation by asking me how I was doing and joking about how he hoped the aisle wouldn't be so tight at the venue.\n\nAt the wedding \n\nFast forward. Before the wedding, which was held outside, these were the top moments. \n\nOne particular moment, we, the bridesmaids, were in the process of taking pictures with the bride. Once we finished, we stood around outside while the groomsmen were in the venue with the groom. I heard noise, it was his son trying to go outside, so he came to get him. At the moment I looked from his kid to him, and he looked up at me at the same time, I quickly turned my head because I was blushing. Soon, then, he told his son, “You’ll have to stand here and look at the pretty ladies taking pictures”, I mean, coincidence, maybe?\n\nAnother moment happened right after, my plus one (another best friend of mine) noticed, he was standing near the door when we walked in, then he saw it was me, and continued to stare until he turned away to continue talking with his family members.\n\nDuring the recession, he asked me how I was doing while we walked up the aisle. I told him my feet were killing me, and he said he was related because his knees were hurting as well, and we both laughed at that. It felt very nice. My plus one joked that we looked cozy, and he was attentive, and held on to each other until we got inside. Of course, he was a gentleman, and he let me go first. When we got inside, it looked like he wanted to finish the conversation, but couldn't because it was time for the bridal party to be around the bride and groom, and soon after, we all had to take pictures.\n\nOnce we were done taking pictures, I went to sit with my friends for the reception inside the barn. I was tired. My feet still hurt because of the heels. I noticed he came over to get himself a drink, so I decided to confidently ask him, “Can you give me a bottle of water?” He nicely accepted the request, but he was looking high and low for that water and couldn't find it in the cooler. Until another person opened another cooler, and the water was in there. Since it was closer to me, I said, “Oh, never mind, I can get the water, it's right here.” I tried to reach for it from my chair, but he said, “No, I got you”, and he proceeded to get me the bottle of water. \n\nAt a big moment at the reception, I was talking with one of my friends, and all of a sudden, I felt a pair of eyes on me, which caused me to turn, and he was looking at me, then quickly, he turned his head.\n\nThere was a moment when he was really being a dad, which was good because he was looking for his child. Usually, the kid would be with relatives. In my opinion, I don’t mind him having a kid; I know many people my age are starting families. However, the only downside is that my family is against it. As for his family, I’m not entirely sure; I’ve heard from the bride that his mother is somewhat shipping. She even mentioned me to him before, but she downplayed it when she was caught. There are times when she butters me up. There’s a lot to consider, but I want to know if he's interested. He's truly my type to T. I don’t want to initiate, I believe he wants to he would, but I understand why he can’t because he might feel I’m not interested, but i am. I need some more opinions first. Oh, and he doesn't live in the same state; I live in Georgia, and he lives in Utah.\n\n.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Our relationship has always been rooted in tenderness, comfort, and emotional safety. He’s loyal, affectionate, and kind with his words. But lately, that comfort has started to feel more like a trap than a partnership.\n\nI’ve always been more spontaneous, curious, and chaotic in a good way. I like trying new things, going to new places, meeting people, being in motion. He says he wants that too, but in reality, he sticks to what’s familiar. If it were up to him, he’d go to the beach five days a week and stay in his usual routine. Any time I suggest something different, he has a reason why he can’t. I’ve tried planning things together, making chore charts, breaking things into steps, but nothing ever sticks. He’ll say he wants to get out of his comfort zone but never takes action. I’m the one who keeps adapting and compromising.\n\nWe broke up last December and I moved out. He started reaching out again after a few months, saying all the right things and telling me he had changed. I decided to give it one last try. But now it’s September, and the same patterns are showing up again. He talks about change but doesn’t follow through. He wants credit for wanting to be better, but I never see actual growth.\n\nWe recently went on a trip for my brother’s birthday, and I was still grieving the recent loss of my grandmother. Even then, he made the trip about him. He didn’t offer support or step up to help, just stayed in his own world. I kept thinking, I shouldn’t have to ask for this. I shouldn’t have to beg my partner to show up.\n\nThe most frustrating part is how often he says our problem is communication. But I am a very clear communicator. The issue isn’t that I don’t express myself. It’s that he doesn’t want to hear anything that makes him uncomfortable. He avoids hard conversations, dismisses things as “not that serious,” and turns things around on me.\n\nThis breakup feels mature, which makes it even harder. It’s not a blowout. There’s no cheating, no screaming. He’s not a bad person. He’s just not showing up in a way that makes me feel like I have a real partner. And while I love the loyalty and sweetness, I keep wondering if some of his behaviors are just who he is. He says he wants to change, but I honestly don’t know if he ever will. And I’m scared I’ll leave and end up in something worse, but I’m also scared to stay and keep slowly losing myself.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nMy partner is kind, loyal, and emotionally safe in a surface-level way, but avoids growth and change. I’ve tried everything to make this relationship more balanced, but I’m tired of being the only one trying. He says he wants to do better, but nothing ever actually shifts. I’m not sure if I should stay or go, and I’m struggling to tell the difference between settling and being patient.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

My long distance girlfriend is going through the worst time of her life as she is grieving the loss of her father from a few weeks ago. I haven’t had the privilege to meet this man but I owe him everything for how he raised her to be such an amazing woman. I want to preface this that what she is going through is truly one of the worst things a person can go through especially since we are so young. I can see her shutting down and being emotionally drained and it breaks my heart. I want to be there for her and I also want to give her the space she needs to process. What I am going through is nothing in comparison to her grief, I know this, but I wanted to know how people can get through the silence and agony of not being able to physically be there for someone at a time like this. We both still love each other and she has her moments where she’ll be smiling and laughing but I know grief comes in waves. So this is followed by days of crying and sleeping. We went from checking in and calling and spending time together over the phone or discord to now I hear from her once in the day and then maybe some time at night when she’s awake. I really feel selfish even being sad about not seeing her, but I can’t reach out to anyone I know because they either dismiss how I’m feeling as being too emotional, or they outright doubt my relationship because it’s long distance.

{"id": "u/needalldapokemanz_236", "user": "u/needalldapokemanz", "text": "Am I right to be upset with her?\n\nI started talking to this girl 2 months ago, we met on an online game, started off as friends and one thing led to another and we behaved in ways that would highly suggest more than friendship. Flirting, sexting, good morning/night texts, talking all day, had plans to meet IRL blah blah blah\n\n2 months in and she’s gone cold on me. Distant, ghosting me for 5 days, giving vague excuses, breadcrumbing me, said we should do something like hang out probably out of guilt, and then she couldn’t even follow through with that and she went straight back to ghosting for another 3 days. \n\nShe claims she’s so busy, and as she’s going through a big life change, her visas run out where she is living currently and has to come to my country to reset it so she can go back, and she’s staying with an online friend who she’s known for a long time whilst she’s here, so I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt as I can imagine that could be quite overwhelming.\n\nYet her excuses and her actions aren’t aligning. Busy booking flights and getting ready to come, and a day trip out doesn’t account for 5 days of ghosting. \n\nI’ve been monitoring her activity on discord (unhealthy, I know) but I had the feeling that she was “cheating” and it was nagging me, driving me insane. I thought I was just being insecure, but someone who claims there “so busy” spends an awful lot of time being active on discord mobile, constantly popping us as active and going inactive, usually for 2-5 minutes then going off. Which would indicate she’s texting someone on it, just not me. \n\nI’m certain there’s more to this than she’s telling me. My intuition says she’s found someone else, whether it’s someone new, or an ex back in the picture I don’t know for sure, I’m leaning someone new because she seemed really turned off by her ex when we had briefs chat about him, regardless whoever it is she’s not too busy for them, she’s just to busy for me. \n\nShe hasn’t blocked me, but it’s like she’s keeping me on ice as a backup plan or something, as shes coming to this country and we had plans to meet, and I take her around one of the capitals for a day out. Maybe she just thought she could still use me for that as entertainment and a wallet for the day, otherwise if she’s lost interest why hasn’t she just blocked me?\n\nI can’t sit and just point fingers because clearly I went wrong somewhere, else she wouldn’t have lost interest. I’ve done a lot of reflection to figure out where and brutally honest, I never set expectations or boundaries such as exclusivity etc or about where this was going, or what this even is, when I should have much earlier on. Maybe she was waiting for me to lead in this regard but I hadn’t gotten around to it. I wasn’t assertive enough in this regard, so while our behaviour with eachother was highly suggesting more than friends, how entitled can I really feel to be this upset when it’s on me to set these things in place. Maybe this was a turn off for her because it was too ambiguous, which makes sense\n\nAt the same time while it’s the man’s job to do these things, surely she could have voiced these things if they were her concerns? Instead of communicating that she just went cold and moved on to the next guy\n\nIn all honesty, this is the first time I’ve really spoken to a girl romantically so I was bound to make some mistakes, I wasn’t aware of the right timing for these actions, but it was definitely around where things started going cold in hindsight. I didn’t realise the unwritten expectations of talking daily with lots of frequency until I spoke with a friend about it, whose girlfriend said that if he didn’t speak to her for a day then he would assume he was cheating. \n\nThere were times when it was going well and she wouldn’t speak for a couple hours and then apologise for not doing so, which I thought was unnecessary as I’m happy to go lengths without talking as again, my first time really speaking to someone romantically I didn’t know the expectation was so high in terms of constant talking. \n\nAbout a month or so in, I went one evening where I didn’t respond purely because I was a bit tired and I wasn’t sure what to say, she quadruple text me and the next day I didn’t apologise as I didn’t think it was nessecary as we didn’t have a label so i didn’t feel like we owed eachother that. She never called this out and continued like normal but I think things started to get cold from here, maybe this made her feel anxious as our rhythm had been constant before this point. Interestingly it was from here that things slowly started to decrease in terms of our rhythm. I went back to normal after that but she slowly grew distant.\n\nIf this was something that upset her, again I understand now and I should have apologised, but at the same time she could have called it out? For me I’m happy to go hours without speaking I’m not like that, if I feel I don’t have anything to say I don’t like to just talk for the sake of talking you know, but maybe this evening I took of made her feel anxious? Maybe I’m overthinking and this wasn’t the turning point, maybe it was my assertiveness and leading as a whole. \n\nWhile I wasn’t the perfect communicator either, I always tried and put in the effort, especially when she went ghost. \n\n\nThe weekend before last, we had a gaming session on the Sunday, albeit a short one. Normally we would play all day but she breadcrumbed me with a short session for a couple hours. Then she doesn’t text at all for 3 days, despite her being the last to message in the chat, so I decided to “double text” which I’ve never done with her, a message her saying “thinking of you, hope your having a better week than last” as she had some issues that week. No response, only 2 days after she then responds “sorry I’ve been so busy IRL and getting ready to come to X country” so I sent her a message about “I get it’s probably an overwhelming time so I understand, we spent alot of time together before then and a breather probably did us some good, but silence for 5 days was mean.”\n\nShe was super apologetic and said she should have message, what are you down to do? So I said let’s play something and have a catchup. And then she makes an excuse suddenly as to why she can’t do that and said okay let’s do another time trying to play it cool, which felt extremely insensitive on her part as I just put my heart on my sleeve and she just blew me off for something minor. Since then another 3 days have passed and it’s been the same, straight silence.\n\nAnd throughout these periods of silence, she’s been super active on discord. Today she’s been popping up active and inactive pretty consistently for the last 5 hours or so. So she’s 100% not as busy as she claims to be. How can she sit there brazenly showing her status like that and just lie to my face? It’s like she wants me to see it and take the hint, that’s how blatant it is. She will pop up on it 6-12 times an hour, she’s clearly not that busy.\n\nMy plan now is to just return her energy now, and if she comes back then step up for myself and have the boundaries and expectations conversation, and if she complies then I can let her back in. But if she comes back to me with vague responses again and breadcrumbing her I should probably just ignore her. She’s walking over me, and part of that’s my fault here, so I think the middle ground is set those boundaries if she comes back and no more games. And if she can’t then obviously I’ll walk. Because I fell for her pretty hard, and part of me feels I shouldn’t stand for this and walk away now, but the other part of me still wants her, and if she displays enough interest and I can sucessfully set the boundaries and expectations then maybe we can repair this. I’m not sure what the best way would be to have this convo is, obviously once she shows interest again, but at what point? \n\nIf she messages back and gives dry re entries like simple hellos or whatever then it feels weird to just jump in with that.

I always have these thoughts from time to time, being so frustrated at the fact i can't just go to his house or hang out whenever we're not busy. It really gets to me and today it's been so so bad. I went to visit him juet 2 hours away , it's not that far but when your schedules don't align and you only get maximum 2 days off of work it doesn't work out well. I went to visit him for a couple days and it was the hardest thing having to leave, because i knew i was going to feel this way again. It's just an overwhelming feeling of loneliness and dread having to come home to do the same things i've always done on the phone with him but always truly alone. \n\nAs much as i hate admitting this but it's been eating at me so bad i can't keep it to myself anymore. I've been having thoughts of regret at the fact that i got with someone far from me, because i always have been a very physically emotional person when it comes to relationships. Of course i love talking to him on calls, watching movies , plays games occasionally. But i have this empty feeling in the back of my mind slowly growing . because i'm truly not with him and i feel so alone everyday. as much as he reassures me i'm not, i just can't make this feeling go away. I often see other guys and think what if i was with them? it would make things so much easier but then i remember that they aren't him and will never be him and i can't ever get over that just to not feel empty anymore. and this makes me sound so horrible and i know i am. I'm so so selfish only thinking about how i feel. he's so willing to wait for me and i'm having second thoughts. How dare i? how selfish can i be to think these things, knowing all the selfless things he's done for me?\n\nthis eats away at me every day gettinf worse and worse.

Also i do try to date in my city but my type and vibes seem more international tbh.\n\nEvery LDR starts strong and for some reason I start drifting more and more. Like shouldnt I want to talk to them everyday? They have been busy ppl so a lot of them cant talk everyday. But im sure that makes them feel unwanted. Idk. Maybe it was their first LDR. But is this me not having complete interest? I get invested and feel like the distance creates a bond. But i know that not b the case on their end. I loved the 1st and the 3rd and the 2nd I was okay with the seperation. I dont want this cycle to repeat. I really cared about my ex but maybe the women I date dont see as a partner because I have no plan in life? Ive worked hard in my life and I enjoy peace and all my hobbies currently. I give a lot to myself to the mental state of the LDR but maybe dont really get to know my partner. I think for the latter it was because she always wasnt sure because LDR wasnt for her and I was afraid of losing her. So I just preserved the false peace we had and it broke in our last discussion. She triggered a really deep wound and I made some mistakes becuase I had slept only 2-3 hrs per day when we were talking that 3 day stretch. conversely i triggered her trauma from for ex but I was respectful, just said it in a sharp tone. no bad words. I felt we could have grown from it. I have 5 weeks of no contact. its been 3.5 weeks since she blocked me after for a total of 8.5 weeks since the fight and 13 ish weeks since the initial pre breakup Idk. i wasnt there for her when her dad passed away, I was initially and then 2.5 weeks later she gets mad at overcrossing her boundaries w/o explanation and breaks up with me. Why couldnt i have the emotional maturity to ignore the break up and focus on her. I really didnt want to lose her. and so I crried a lot in front of her. she is the only one whos ever seen me like that. but maybe she lost respect for the lack of masculinity. i was just being real. She wanted someone that would lead her and said I was a child at heart. So is this due to our differences? Idk. I still love her. Maybe we werent right for each other but it eats at me I couldnt just focus on her and her dads passing. she never reached out or told me to go visit her isntead of me trying to visit her during her peak work which in turn crossed her boundaries for a 2nd time.

He (M23) broke up with me (F21) yesterday through text. We were together for 2 1/2 years and saw each other 2 times during the relationship. I flew to Switzerland to see him for the first time in May and it was so perfect. I saw him again in July, but it was only for a few days since we had scheduling problems due to work. For the past month, I felt distant from him because it felt as if he would choose to be with his friends over texting and calling me. I was never against him being with his friends, I just wanted to feel like a priority to him again. We usually call every day, but we haven’t called since Friday because his friend was staying with him for a few days. During the same weekend, I found out my dad had to go back to the hospital, so I‘ve been very anxious and badly needed support from him. I told him the news, but he was unable to call me since his friend was always with him. He checked in on me through text on Tuesday and everything felt fine, he even said he loved me and gave me support. Then, on Wednesday I noticed he unfollowed and removed me as a follower on all my instagram accounts. With how bad my anxiety has been, this made me feel like spiraling. I messaged him questioning if I did anything, what happened, etc. He never responded until the next day. When he got home from work I tried to call him many times, but he kept declining immediately. He finally told me he was calling his mom, then proceeded to send a very long breakup message. He said he has felt unsure ever since the July visit because he felt as if the distance was too hard to keep up with. This unsure thought was always in his mind for the past 2 months apparently. He always said he wanted to move to America with me even though I told him I was open to going anywhere. He said he still loves me and would’ve worked it out if we were in the same place. After, he ended up saying that he feels like he’s too young to leave Switzerland now that he has gotten closer to his friends there this year and wants to be with family. I kept insisting for him to answer my calls so we can have a proper chat, but he kept refusing since he wanted everything to end now. I understand long distance is hard, but he had never expressed the struggle he felt about it to me. Eventually, he ended the conversation and blocked me on everything. I‘m so heartbroken because I did nothing wrong and we both spoke often about our future plans. The past month we were planning his first visit to me in November for my birthday. It feels as if my world is falling apart as I‘m very sentimental. He is the very first guy I‘ve ever told my family about. I can’t bring myself to delete any memories or things that we have gotten each other. I desperately want him to come back to me because he is my very first love. I feel like I didn’t have enough time to process my thoughts and what I wanted to say before he blocked me. All I wanted was a final call during the moment.

I’m relatively new to LDR of this extent (5 hour flight, 3 HR time difference). We did date/talk for 7 months in person before he moved and we decided to do LDR. My question is sometimes I find it difficult to trust him due to a multitude of reasons. Reasons include: my own insecurity and recent discovery my ex has been possibly falling for a friend and jumped into pursuing her soon after things ended, he (current bf) changed his hinge location twice while we were in exclusive but not yet dating or deciding to do LDR phase (but did not talk or meet up w anyone that I know of), and thirdly my own general insecurity of feeling like he’s out of my league. Usually, he’s very good with making me feel loved and secure, and he’s very transparent with where he is/what he’s doing. We share locations, occasionally check in via text while we’re working, and call or FT nightly usually. He informs me of plans and I’ve met his roommate and roommates wife. However, I still find myself at times being anxious that he might be cheating or pursuing other women, and I think the distance makes it worse. He hasn’t done anything suspicious outright, but changes in texting tone and consistency are some things that can set me off. That coupled with the fact that we have no mutuals and met less than a year ago makes me question him more than someone like my ex who I knew from school and was able to see multiple times a week because we lived in the same town. We don’t usually “fight” about situations where I feel insecure or anxious , and some of them are valid. For times sake I won’t go into every single time, but I usually bring them up, and he is patient with explaining himself. However, he’s expressed some hurt that I don’t “100%” trust him the way he trusts me and knows my heart. I realize my own insecurity plays a part in this. What can we both do to work towards a more balanced and trusting relationship?

We had good communication and it truly felt like a healthy relationship.\n\nDespite this, we had too many challenges related to long distance - him financially providing for his family so he can’t just up and move; me tied down with a dog but also struggling to figure out a path to obtain visas (with marriage being the only option), as well as not really wanting to join corporate America. \n\nAnd it got to the point where reality hit for us, as we kept pushing closing the gap to the back of our mind.

Sure, we had some bickering or disagreements sometimes, but I feel like it was normal as we were just getting used to being with eachother physicially, and witnessing new mannerisms.

Whenever we get the chance to spend one or two weeks together, it feels like a dream — our connection is strong, and when we’re apart, we stay close through daily texts and FaceTime.\nRecently, she came to visit me in my country. The trip went perfectly: we laughed, traveled, shared a lot of romance, and had no issues at all. But on the last day, just before she had to leave, she suddenly broke up with me. She told me I was the perfect guy, but that she wasn’t ready for another relationship, even though she wanted to be. Only recently did I find out she had ended a four-year relationship just two months before meeting me, which I hadn’t known. I accepted her decision and dropped her off at the airport the next day. But as soon as she landed back home, she called me crying, saying she didn’t mean to break up and kept spamming me with messages. She later admitted she has intimacy issues with me and didn’t know how to bring it up, so instead she panicked and ended things — but now she regrets it and wants to make up. I’m really confused. We had such a good time together, and then out of nowhere it’s like a switch flips in her. This isn’t the first time either — early in the relationship she broke up with me, only to regret it immediately. I’ve tried talking to her about these issues, but she avoids addressing them, stating that she just needs time. With intimacy, I’ve always been careful and respectful, asking her before and after if she felt comfortable, since she’s told me she likes to take things slow.

I'm an aspiring law student and I'm starting a new job soon. I decided to edit my instagram profile to remove emojis from my name which had the heart, locket and the Turkish nazar because I was experimenting with fonts and simplifiyng my profile, I had forgotten my girlfriend asked me not to remove it before twice (Symbolic), but since I was giving my profile a complete change I deleted it. Immediately I get an upset message asking why I deleted it. I told her it was a profile makeover and I didn't want it to be childish anymore or too colourful. She got mad and stopped calling me her love and eventually just left the conversation after saying it no longer has a meaning to her and didn't matter.\n\nI apologized and told her I will restore it to how it was, just in a different place on my bio. She didn't say anything and just kept ignoring me for two hours and intentionally not reading my texts. I thought she was upset, so I called her since she had a bad week, but she kept declining. Then I got upset she was intentionally avoiding me, so I texted her and said how am I supposed to know how she feels or trust her when she stonewalls me instead of healthy communication? I said I wanted to resolve this and I felt hurt something so simple had a huge impact on her.\n\nFast forward, I call her and she calls me insecure and childish she demands I delete the emojis now, she will watch me do it and keeps threatening she will hang-up on me if I don't delete them. I kept telling her I'm not going to let her do this to me. It is my profile. She says hurtful things, so I eventually cry, and I notice I am deeply emotionally hurt because I had a lot of things happening, graduation close, exams, moving to another country, financial issues and family problems... Immediately she tells me to stop crying saying it's pointless. I explain to her I don't understand why she is treating me this way, but I feel hurt. I tell her all I wanted was to apologize but her intentional behaviour to hurt me affected me. My behaviour changes and I get mad at her. I ask would she treat her family this way? She doesn't respond. I ask if she loves me, she says she can't answer. She tells me she's the one getting mad now.\n\nI try to resolve the situation by saying I love her maybe I overreacted at the start, but that I still felt hurt, but she pins it on me. We call again, she tells me to go fuck myself accuses me of cheating because my followers keep increasing, she says I probably removed the emojis to be single. She starts trying to flip the script, saying I'm the issue, I'm insecure I almost threw a remote at her one day (When in reality when I came to visit her in Turkey she refused me to buy her presents, said she didn't want them, didn't allow me to pay for the restaurants and even confiscated my pants and put them in a locked safe because apparently my outfit was too tight for her tastes) Back then I broke down because I was emotionally upset, I threw the remote at the bed and burst out crying. Now she brought it up to say I'm unstable just because I broke down crying. I reminded her she's the one with trust issues because on our first meeting she pinned me to the bed and confiscated my phone not trusting me. She got drunk and almost assaulted me, but I told her to stop and threw her off when she touched my neck. I said we wouldn't resolve anything pointing fingers.\n\nNow she's telling me I'm the problem, I'm overreacting, I'm insecure and childish and that I shouldn't be upset or crying over this. She asked me what I wanted her to do, and I said nothing just reflect on the situation because neither one of us is right. I said I would have appreciated an apology, but she told me she didn't do anything wrong so she's not willing to see my point of view. She just left the call yesterday and went to bed without an apology. Today she texted me good morning without any affection.\n\nAm I overreacting, did I do something wrong by removing the emoji's from my profile and apologizing to her?

I’m pretty much stuck in a situationship. He told me about 6 months ago that if we were to be together it would take maybe 1-2 years because he was unsure of where he’s at in his life or what to do with it. He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me.

He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. I don’t really know how to speak to him again.

He tells me he does genuinely care about me and everything else and part of me believes in his own way he does but right now I feel like I’ve wasted 9 months but at the same time I haven’t really because he’s helped me through a lot of shit at the same time - I feel attached to him but I don’t think it’s necessarily a good attachment.\n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me.

I am currently in a wierd place with my relationship with my long distanse boyfriend (18). \n\nA little background on our relationship: Me (19) and my bf (18) have been together for soon 1.5 years. 3 months into the relationship I moved to another city about 2 hours with train from my hometown (where both me and my boyfriend are from and met). I studied there for one year while he was still in highschool. (I am from europe so the ages and schooling is different). Anyways, in August of this year my boyfriend left for the military where he will be for the next 2 years. I however moved to a different country a few weeks ago and will live here for 3 years as I am getting my bachelor. (The plane ride is like 4 hours and you have to have a connecting flight to get to my new city). Anyways, I have not started school yet so i am just enjoying my new city alone.\n\nI am finding it really hard to connect to my bf now, especially since he left for the military. He has very little free time, meaning we dont get to talk a lot. Mostly on messages and a bit of phone calls. This is totally different from when we did medium distanse, since both of us were usually available all the time then and would meet at least once a month, whereas now we only see each other during christmas and summer break. There really is no solution to that problem because he is busy and does not have the same free time to talk as i have now and still will have when uni starts. \n\nSo i am wondering if anyone has any tips on how to make this easier, especially for me. Since I am the one waiting for a call and a message, and he does not have the opportunity to talk to me. How do I become ok with that? I kind of feel like the spark is gone in a way, because we are not able to really talk  about our day and life. We have totally different lives and people we surround ourselves with. To me it is very important to be able to share all of that (not in a \"we are one person\" way, but more in a \"I want to love those you love\" way). I dont know if i am just overthinking everything and i am emotional because I am in a new city all alone for the first time in my life. \n\nAny tips and help would be deeply appreciated! thank you for reading", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Some background.\n\nI am in a long term relationship, own a home together, 2 children (12 and 13) and have a really comfortable life. Our relationship has been amazing for as long as i can remember. We are still madly in love, my partner and me share the duties whilst both working, connected emotionally, physically and spiritually, but I'm feeling some guilt lately.\n\nI have never had a huge friend group which is totally ok with me, I've had friends in the past that have burned me, used me and hurt me mentally. I wear my heart on my sleeve and have in the past given far too much to be used in the process. Hubby has been very open and understanding about these situations and has given me great advice and speaks his mind if he sees me being hurt which i love and take on board but ultimately wants me to live and learn from mistakes which i have.\n\n  \nOnto my conundrum.\n\nI have started a new job in aged care a little over 12 months ago (IYKYK) and by far has been the most rewarding and toxic experience of my life. I have had so many rewarding highs but also has taken its toll mentally. My partner helps me and is my absolute rock, listening, giving advice and making our home my safe space. My partner is the ying to my yang as he is very easy going and doesnt take life too seriously whereas i have a very overactive and anxious mind\n\nI have met some great people at work but one imparticular that i call my best friend. He is (M50), we have very similar interests (horror movies, crystals etc.) and get along really well. this man has come from a super toxic long tern relationship which has shut him off from people completely. Over the year we have bonded in a way that i/we have helped this man in regaining some of his confidence, moving into his own place and basically started over. Him and the few work colleagues that know his situation have said i am his guardian angel and that no one has been able to help this man. He is the literal most sensitive person i have ever met, have heard this man cry more times than my children, and will get upset if he thinks he has said something to upset me even the slightest and is just genuinely broken.\n\n  \nNow onto my feelings of guilt.\n\nMy partner knows this man very well. He classes him as a close friend of his also. We have meals together, movies and other activities and will/has bent over backwards to help wherever he can. He knows we talk and text on the phone, catch up outside of work and knows that i will be safe. I have zero intimate or physical feelings for my best friend but have been finding myself deleting texts and feeling guilty when we speak on the phone for too long when my partner is home. I apologize for talking too long which i get a reply \"don't be silly its fine\" which i believe but am still feeling guilty for some reason. \n\nWith work i have suffered from some pretty bad burnout and although my home is my rock, i sometimes feel that i don't have the energy for too much conversation or physical attention but if bestie needs me i will jump to attention. If my and hubby are having a night out or weekend away, I feel that i need to lie to bestie about it incase it hurts his feelings, even though i have no feelings for him like i do my partner. It also feels kind of weird to kiss my partner when bestie is around as he's like a father figure to me (i lost my father at a young age).\n\n  \nI don't know why i am deleting texts or asking my partner for permission to talk but this is all new to me. I don't feel like i am pushing the line with what I'm saying but maybe i am and is why im feeling guilty?\n\nMy partner hasn't said anything to me about this but feel sometimes that he isn't feeling my energy or affection but maybe that is my guilt?\n\nI feel that if my partner was like my bestie i would feel extremely suffocated, but knowing his personality, i know that this isnt how he is.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

How can I handle this?\n\nI \\[M19\\] saw a quote today that said, *“Your soulmate is your compliment, not your missing piece.”* I do not think that applies to my relationship, and that is what has been bothering me.\n\nMy girlfriend \\[F20\\] is kind, caring, and I love her deeply. We have been together for over a year and she means a lot to me, and I do not want to lose what we have. At the same time, it has been getting harder to handle certain patterns that are wearing me down. Her happiness seems to depend almost entirely on me, and that dependence has become overwhelming. While I enjoy supporting her, I cannot be the only source of her security or emotional stability.\n\nThese patterns were present before, but they have intensified since I started university. During the summer, we met frequently and spent long periods together. Now that I have less free time because of my studies, we see each other much less. Meanwhile, she is unemployed and looking for work.\n\nHer anxiety has grown over time. She often worries about losing me or that someone might come between us. These fears sometimes result in nightmares, even when we are sleeping next to each other. She frequently wakes up upset, and even though I try to comfort her, the situation does not improve.\n\nThere are also smaller patterns that add up. She worries about small things I do or say, checks my phone when we are together, and wants us to spend much of our time on calls, even during periods of rest. These behaviors make me feel restricted and monitored.\n\nWe also have some differences in lifestyle and preferences. They are not extreme, but they have affected how comfortable I feel in certain situations. Combined with the other issues, it sometimes feels like we are not fully aligned in how we live and interact, which has been difficult for me.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling emotionally exhausted. I feel like I am constantly careful not to trigger her anxiety, which limits my own sense of freedom. Despite investing a lot of time and energy into supporting the relationship, these patterns have intensified rather than improved.\n\nI am torn because I care deeply about her and our relationship. Ending things would be complicated and painful, but I am also concerned about how sustainable this dynamic is. Both families know about us, we have many mutual friends. I need either significant changes in how we manage these challenges, including healthier boundaries and coping strategies, or to accept that the current pattern may not be healthy for either of us in the long term.\n\nCould you give me some tips on how i should approach this situation and how do i set boundaries?\n\nTL:DR:  \nI love my girlfriend and care about our relationship, but her anxiety and dependence on me have become overwhelming. These issues existed before, but they’ve worsened since I started university, with less time to see each other while she has more free time. She worries constantly, has nightmares, checks my phone, and wants us on calls almost all the time, which makes me feel restricted.

I escaped, and now I’m questioning whether I should ever speak to him again\n\nEarlier this year my (30F) mom (72F) separated from my dad (73M), and I started seeing him differently. Growing up, I thought he was brilliant — but I now see he never considered anyone else’s opinion, argued endlessly and philosophically, never reached resolutions, and often discredited me or my mom.\n\nHe was diagnosed around age 70 with Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Hemicrania Continua. I try to take that into account, but his behavior has gotten worse over time.\n\nI have been living abroad for the past 4 years, and I regularly visit. I was visiting him for a few days this month. During one of his never-ending “talks,” I told him I think he behaves like a victimist narcissist, because he reframes everything so he’s the victim, discredits my feelings, and never takes responsibility. He did exactly that: he denied everything, accused me of being the narcissistic and victimistic one, and discredited my own experience of having lived 26 years with him, which led me to identify that pattern and express that to him with examples. He was not happy about what I said, but I eventually had to cut the conversation off because I had other commitments.\n\nLater that day, after I finished my commitments, he came to my room and insisted we continue talking. I refused and tried to leave. He blocked the door, grabbed my arms, and started screaming. His face and eyes looked almost possessed. He wouldn’t let go. I screamed at him to release me, but he held on tighter. For the first time in my life, I was genuinely afraid of him and feared for my life.\n\nI have never been in a fight before, and the first fight of my life was with my own dad. The one person who was supposed to protect and support me was instead the person making me fear for my safety.\n\nI tried to get free without hurting him, but he ended up stepping on something and fell. I helped him up, hoping it would calm him, but it didn’t. I attempted to pack while he kept grabbing me. Finally, in panic, I see his arm reaching my neck, and I bit him and pushed just enough to break free. I ran out the door and as far as I could before stopping.\n\nLater, he called my cousin (30F), saying my mom and I were “against him,” conveniently leaving out that he physically restrained me.\n\nThe next morning, I returned with my older cousin (51F) and uncle (80M) to collect my things. When I walked in, the same arms and nails that had dug into my skin the day before were now reaching out to hug me. He acted loving, like nothing had happened. I said “no” firmly, which he immediately used against me by telling my uncle, \"Do you see how she is with me?\". He followed me around, tried to block me again, but I stayed focused on leaving. If my relatives hadn’t been there, I believe he would have tried to stop me again.\n\nIt’s been almost two weeks. I’ve blocked him. I don’t think an apology would be sincere, and I’m scared of what he might say if we speak again. I’m planning to start therapy to process this, but I would appreciate advice or experiences from anyone who has been through something similar.\n\nTL;DR: My dad (73M), who has a personality disorder, blocked me from leaving during an argument, grabbed my arms, and raised his arm toward my neck. I panicked, bit him, and escaped. The next day, I collected my things with family present while he acted as though nothing had happened — even trying to hug me with the same arms that had restrained me. I’ve blocked him and am planning to see a therapist.

I personally feel like there is a major part of our relationship that hasn’t been built because of being long distance. I think there is a lot that you can learn about someone through more typical day to day experiences and it bothers me that we haven’t had much of a chance for that.

I am very set on not leaving where I currently live and have been very clear about that from the beginning of our relationship. She keeps trying to convince me to move to where she lives which has begun to irritate me as I have been very clear from the beginning and has degraded some of my trust as it almost feels like she doesn’t want to leave and she hasn’t been honest with me.

I need advice on what to do.\n\nMy girlfriend (18F) and I (20M) have been together for over 18 months now.\n\nShe is so amazing in so many ways. I genuinely never would've beleived I could find someone like her, but I did, and I could see myself spending the rest of my life with her... were it not for one thing.\n\nI'm genuinely feeling like she doesn't actually love me. It feels so horrible to say, but it's true. She barely shows any affection towards me at all.\n\nShe often doesn't look at me on dates, just stares forward or at her food. When on a date I try to put my full attention on her, while she almost always takes phone calls, sends texts and the like (she's very close with her mother, so not entirely her fault, bur still.)\n\nShe offered to cook for me one time, she got me a nice gift for my birthday and she put on a nice dress I'd been wanting to see her in for a while. Those are literally the only examples of explicit affection I can think of from the past 6 months.\n\nI won't list all the things I do for her, because it isn't a competition, but I will say it is much more than this.\n\nShe reciprocates whenever I hold her hand, hug her or kiss her, but she almost never initiates anything. She'll sit in my lap, but only if I ask (or if the seat is dirty), she'll play with my hair, but only if I ask, she'll cuddle up to me in bed, but only if I ask, etc.\n\nMy love language is very heavily physical touch (I was touch-deprived in my childhood for some currently irrelevant reasons) and it was supposedly hers too, but I'm not feeling it at all. I almost feel like I'm being *endured* by her. Like she's just *putting up* with my affection.\n\nThis really hurts, as I always pictured my relationship to be with a woman who will leap at me and smush her face into my chest whenever we see eachother. She is very much not like that.\n\nEven in bed, cuddling, she prefers to face away from me and for me to spoon her from behind. No hate on spooning, but with all this context, it always makes me feel like it's a metaphor for the way our relationship works.\n\nThis is only compounded by the fact that we haven't had sex yet. We discussed this at the very beginning of the relationship, and we're both okay with having it before marriage, but she said she would like to wait until her 18th birthday with it. It wouldn't have been illegal before then or anything, she just wanted it that way and I agreed. Well, her birthday came and passed, but nothing. She's not ready.\n\nI, of course, didn't push her. Each time this has come up, I always told her I only want it when she does too, otherwise there's no point. I still don't press her about it, but she's turning 19 in two months... and still not ready.\n\nI'm willing to wait as long as she needs, but it would be a lie to say this doesn't twist the knife even more. Especially since I'm a bit chubby and not happy with the way I look, while she is fit, healthy and drop dead gorgeous.\n\nThis, with all the other things really makes me feel unloved and unwanted in the relationship.\n\nI've recently opened up to her about this (maybe like 2 months ago or so) and we've had several discussions about it since. She's admitted to me that she's always had trouble showing affection to people, not just romantically but in every type of relationship in her life. She actually seemed very upset that this had happened with me too.\n\nShe said she would maybe need to see a therapist to work on it, and I supported her in that. We've been trying to pick one out for her since then.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because of a conversation we had today. She opened up to me about her previous relationship (she's my first, I'm her second). She didn't force the topic on me or anything, I encouraged her to open up, but this is essentially what she said:\n\nIn her previous relationship she felt very unloved and her previous boyfriend would often not want to hug her back or seemed uncomfortable in her presence. He also said he didn't find her phyiscally attractive and he never really made her feel special.\n\nSome of this I already knew, and I've always been furious with the idea of someone making my beloved angel feel like she was ugly or clingy. My blood boils even just thinking about it.\n\nWhat hurt my feelings though, was this; she tried to hug him. Tried to be close with him, and he pushed her away. Regularly.\n\nI could throw all my dignity away and beg on the floor for anything more than a short caress from her, but she gave this piece of shit guy active affection and closeness? Him not appreciating this is just the painful cherry on top.\n\nSince this was her vulnerable moment, I tried not to show how hurt I was, but she noticed pretty soon and asked about it, so I told her in the gentlest way possible.\n\nShe said sorry, gave me a hug and after that she had to go home (she was visiting me).\n\nAnd... I don't know, but to be honest I feel like it was a bit of a lackluster apology. Like I said, we've talked about this many a time already and she knows how much I crave to feel wanted by her. One time she actually made an effort to be more affectionate and I was the happiest I'd been in a very long time, but then things kinda went back to the way they used to be, instead of getting better gradually, like I'd hoped.\n\nWe've been planning to move in together about a year from now, and we agreed that this would be the year for us to figure out if we truly want to commit to eachother in this way. If yes, we move in, if not, we go our separate ways.\n\nAnd I still intend on keeping to that, letting this year play out to see if things improve... but I'm genuinely starting to lose faith that my girlfriend even loves me.\n\nI understand her trauma, and I believe her words telling me she does. But my heart doesn't. I brought this up to her after an argument recently where she got really mad at me over something I felt was quite minor. I was upset, and I told her \"I don't know if I believe you love me anymore\".\n\nIt's probably the harshest thing I've ever said to her, and one part of me regrets it, but another feels like it had to be said.\n\nWe talked about it. She cried. She said it felt horrible to imagine looking at me and telling me she loves me while knowing I don't beleive her. And to be honest, it broke my heart too. My eyes welled up with tears just now even from simply writing it down.\n\nBut I can't ignore this anymore. She says she can work on it and we can be happy together. I really hope so. But the longer we go on like this... the harder it gets to believe.\n\nAll the rationale points to her loving me. Why would she spend time with me weekly, why would she text with me every day, why would she stay in the door waving me goodbye after a date, etc. I'm not rich, I'm not hot, I'm not famous, and she's not that shallow of a person anyway.\n\nSo I ***know*** she loves me, but I don't ***feel*** it. And it's really starting to hurt, as I was hoping we'd have made some progress by now.\n\nI realize breaking up will always be an option, but I'd really rather not do that unless I've tried everything else. We have a healthy, stable and strong relationship in all other aspects. Just not this. I really don't want to throw it away and switch out my dream girl to someone else who might love me a little more but will suck in some other way.\n\nReddit... what do I do?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

What I do admit though is that I definitely have insecurities, and sometimes I get scared that he might “disrespect” me which is ridiculous. Anytime we are near eachother he shows me and is physically affectionate when around his friends but anyways what I mean by disrespect is like idk grow too close to them? Not make it obvious that he has a girlfriend when I’m not around? Which even reading now sounds ridiculous and is mostly me filling in gaps cause I have no info on how he acts when I’m not around but I want to get the best advice possible so I’ll be sharing all of my feelings. Just based on principle though he’d never ever cheat on me and I’m 100% secure in that, but I do get a little scared that he might realise he’s growing feelings for someone else and do a clean breakup which is terrifying.\n\nUsually when he’d follow a girl he’d tell me why and more often than not they don’t stay there for long. Usually it’s either uni stuff or potential work opportunities etc. the only regular is one of his friends girlfriends and I’ve met her before. Anyways, I’m assuming it’s most likely because it’s been a while since this happened which is why he didn’t tell me but he followed a girl. She’s a very really pretty girl, especially conventionally speaking like she looks like the whole package. My boyfriend is also very attractive, objectively out of my league. I saw her in his following and they were mutuals which freaked me out a little but I haven’t spoken to him about it just yet cause I wanna do so calmly and not from insecurity. I also wanna grow to be okay for my partner to have girl friends, I think it’s a good thing that demonstrates he views women as people but I just have no idea how to get over this fear and insecurity first. I know I’m not scared of him cheating cause I felt relief that they were mutuals rather than him one sidedly following her for example. I’m just scared and I’d like to see other people’s perspectives and just situations where having girl friends in your boyfriend didn’t end up with a bad ending you know? I’m always exposed to online stories of the bad situations, and it’s especially hard in a long distance.\n\nSo any advice or perhaps sharing of your situation would be great thank you\n\nTLDR: struggling with insecurity around boyfriend potentially having female friends. Not scared of cheating but I’m very insecure and also find myself comparing myself to her.

We have met in person once this past January and I felt the best I have in years being with him. But I’m afraid I’m having trouble trusting him.\n\nSo he was supposed to come down to my state in October of last year and he booked a plane and said it was cancelled out of nowhere only for him to reveal he actually was the one who canceled it because he was nervous. And then, my mom gave him the idea of staying with us since he was having such a hard time finding a place where he lives up north. He agreed to take up the offer and was supposed to drive down in December, but he turned back around because he was getting anxiety driving alone and there was a winter storm. I was devastated but I eventually understood that it wasn’t exactly safe to drive on the ice. \n\nFast forward to this month..I took off a whole week of work because he was supposed to book a flight for me to go to his state and drive down with him, but a few days ago he says he might not be able to because he is scared he will get stranded with no way to fix his car in a state because he only has $1400 and his car takes up a lot of gas. I get it, but at the same time it just seems like he’s avoiding this by making up scenarios that could go wrong. He has told me that he wants to stay in his state but he also wants to be with me for a year down in the south…he seems indecisive. I feel like he’s always making up excuses last minute and he keeps saying that I never listen to him because he’s poor just like me and he’s also “trapped”. He doesn’t realize that his failure to stick with a plan affects me…\n\nMy mom once got mad at me because HE kept changing plans and drew up a conclusion that we were lying to her and that I was sneaking to move up north with him and we were “stalling”…like I was doing no such thing. I just told her what he told me and suddenly I was being called a liar?! And I can’t afford to take off a whole week with no pay…yet I really thought this plan would happen this time. And he keeps saying “I will pay you for the week you took off” that’s like $500 worth of pay I won’t get and you’re willing to pay me for that but you’re not willing to pay for a plane ticket and gas across the country because its too much money?! He lives in the northwest and I live in the southeast..without counting traffic it’s a 48 hr drive..maybe I’m just underestimating how much gas it takes to get from there to here and I realize gas prices are a lot more up north but I don’t understand the logic of paying me $500 when you could spend $500 in gas to get here?

For some context: we were both in first year university but I have decided to drop out and take a gap year due to some program issues. He is still in first year. Although it has only been a talking stage so far, he treats me perfectly and is extremely thoughtful. The only thing is that I’m from Toronto and he’s in nyc. In my opinion the distance isn’t a problem and I’m willing to do LD. Me and him have both agreed that we shouldn’t make things official until we meet eachother in person; so because of this I havent really found interest in anyone else because I only have eyes for him. Recently, he called me and confessed that he had made out with another girl. He apologized, knows he made a mistake and says it wont happen again, and when I asked why he kept telling me he fell into temptation and he didn’t think our situation was that serious (mind you, he had been telling me things like “you’re the only girl I see” and “all I need is you and God”). Of course I was extremely hurt and infidelity is something I take as a dealbreaker. But I find myself going back and forth in my mind because yea we weren’t officially together so it’s not as bad, plus he treated me perfectly. Since then he wrote me many apologies, even a letter expressing how he knows what he lost and what he did was wrong and he’d wait for me as long as I need to feel better and do it right this time but I’m just not sure if I can take that gamble. Prior to our talking stage we had been good friends and he was aware of the things I had been through before (cheating problems in a past relationship). He used to be my safety and comfort and I feel like now I have to question everything he does which I don’t like. Do you guys think it’s worth it giving a shot?

We've been able to spend time together in-person twice during the past 7 months, for about a week back in spring here in the US, and then for two weeks in Sweden last month. We had a wonderful time together, and he introduced me to his parents, it went great, they told him how much they liked me, no problems.  \n  \nPretty much as soon as I returned home from Sweden, I started to pick up on this hot-and-cold behavior. It wasn't always this way and I even struggle with wondering if I'm imagining it, because when I have asked him about it, he insists everything is fine and that he is just tired and I should \"just relax\". The trouble is, though, there are overall concrete differences I can point to between recent behavior and what things were like before. For instance, we have always called each other cute goofy pet names in Swedish, especially when saying goodnight, and although I still do this, he rarely reciprocates anymore. He doesn't want to talk on the phone as much (has outright declined to do so a few times when I've asked, even), and doesn't initiate playing video games or watching tv/movies together on the weekends, while previously he was eager to have our phone calls and would be asking me as early as Monday or Tuesday most weeks what I might like to play or watch together in the upcoming weekend. \n\nWe are both introverts and highly value our alone time, but even when we were together for those two weeks last month, we had no problem giving each other that space. He would chill at his PC while I cooked, or sometimes I'd just take a nap, or hang out in the kitchen listening to the radio, drinking my coffee, and reading or crocheting while he did his own thing too, so I don't think it's just post-visit social burnout. \n\nI'm trying to be cool about this and not overthink it, but I've been through relationships in the past where men were not honest with me, and I eventually gaslit myself into believing when they told me I was imagining it, only for everything to come out later and turn my life upside down.
