We are each others first partner. We have had a pretty rocky relationship since the start where I had to cry and convince him to change his patterns as they were mentally exhausting me. Some of the problems we had in the past were :\n\n1- him entertaining female friends I feel uncomfortable with ( and no i do not mean everyone just 2)\n\n2- him calling other girls/friends “hot” or like checking them out or commenting “🔥🔥🔥” on their post.\n\n3- using my traumas against me as a joke (relative being inappropriate and BD) … he said it was a mistake and apologised profusely.\n\n4- never writing me letters or getting flowers etc even on special occasions like anniversary and birthday.(he did say he couldn’t afford at that time and is a forgetful person)\n\n5-he’s not traditionally masc with me like I don’t expect him to stand up for me ever or stuff (he says hes scared but he has often picked up fights with teachers/cab drivers)\n\n6-he has been angry at me and all for being late at times and honestly sitting in a car with him has always been so stressful for me because he always never talks , looks anxious and makes it look like a burden to drop me home. I get that when youre driving but even when we are in a cab it’s always very weird.\n\n7- We are from a religious background so we haven’t had sex but the occasional slip up like making out and bj has occurred. He’s always very active while sexting ans talks about it to do irl and even initiates at time but then blames me for it.\n\nThese are just some of the primary reasons of arguments in our relationship but personally in the past two years my mental health did get worse and I have been insecure and in self doubt. Also all the blaming and all made my relationship with intimacy really weird.\n\nFast forward now, we are in the same city but diff colleges and meet once in every 2 weeks. Tbh it hasnt been good really, I always feel like I’m too excited to meet him when he isn’t. Plus the whole blaming for trying to kiss him and all when he takes my hands to his dick has messed up a lot on me. It’s selfish to think but ever since I have been away from him I have gotten sm better. I like myself more and have had a boost in confidence and all. All of this also made me realise how maybe I was too young to commit and maybe deserve better ? I havent really had any friends until recently and im too embarrassed to tell them the whole thing because well it is and ik for a fact they will ask me to dump him because I did once slipped up a little and esp after meeting him they weren’t big fans or smth.\n\nBut all of this is very conflicting now since he has changed. Like fr. He doesn’t entertain anyone, he is eager to get me flowers and other stuff, he doesn’t get mad when I’m late or smth. But idky every-time I meet him something happens that triggers everything else and it’s so weird. And today the reason why im writing this is because we had a thunderstorm in our city which got pretty bad to the point of roads being flooded. In this situation him and his another friend dropped one of their female friends (I really like this girl so yes it has no to do with her). She was having anxiety and all as their cab was also getting flooded and she lives in the same area as me. He came home and told me ans I was obviously worried for their safety and all but then he mentioned how he kept on yapping about random stuff , his family and all to her so that she doesn’t feel anxious and all.\n\nnormally it wasn’t a problem and I was really proud of him too. But I couldn’t help but think that 2 months ago when we met in similar conditions he was so awkward and weird w me. He didn’t talk to me, made it seem like the biggest chore ever ans I was honestly really scared to do quite litr say or do anything sitting beside him. So I just felt really jealous that oh maybe If I wasn’t as strong headed and like yk maybe if I were a damsel in distress etc I would be able to bring that side of him? And this spiraled and I felt so enraged idky but yeah this was very weird. I have pcos so I have been trying to stay calm and all but this was like idk so weird. Idk what to do. He has changed but so have I ig.\n\nTL;DR: Bf of 2 years did smth unintentionally to trigger past grudges and trauma but he has changed for the better. Regardless I have started to feel like I deserve better and I don’t know if it’s the LDR effect. Please give tips on how to stay calm and heal.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Is our relationship doomed?\n\nI’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years. We met while I was away from home at university. We met online through tinder and began dating. He would come up to see me all the time, help with chores, take me out places. He was wonderful. I’ve had to move back to my home province for school-related work. He’s come to visit me once during our LDR and it was an amazing time. \nInitially, I thought I would move back to him, but I’ve had to change that goal due to money constraints and some personal health issues. He initially was against moving, but then let me know he was most likely going to move. To be honest, I do talk about it a decent amount because I am excited for him to close the gap. When I’ve checked in with him about that stuff, he has always reassured me, letting me know talking about it helps him process things. Today though, when I mentioned the move because I missed him, things turned out differently. He let me know he was worried to move because of his friends living far away from him. We had a conversation, and then it escalated. He told me he would no longer move because he could not imagine leaving his friends. He said it in such a way that it hurt so bad. \nI tried asking him if this decision was because he just spent time with them yesterday, or if he was stressed. He just doubled down on what he said. \nI became really angry and then gave him an ultimatum which included talking to a professional about his feelings, giving me space, making a pros and cons list. If he doesn’t do that, I told him things would be over\n\nHe just sat there and listened to me.

For context we dated a year and half and met in college. I was finishing up my degree and he finished early and moved to a big city. He did tell me his plans on his first date and I agreed to those terms (though I couldn't picture what LDR is like before). I was tied to anything about my home town other than finishing my degree. It was tough in the beginning I had depressive thoughts and episodes and definitely lashed out against him. I think at times we had an unhealthy addiction to FaceTime. What helped alot is having a definitive timeline of when and how I'm moving. I promised him after I finish up my degree which would be two years. I kept myself occupied by picking up jobs in my field and keeping hobbies. We had daily contact and tried to do a daily activity (Facetime n movie, play a video game and so on).

We’re Always on the Phone, But I Miss Texting (f/28) (M/23) Need advice!\n\n**TL;DR:** *My boyfriend prefers constant phone calls while I prefer some texting and writing. I’ve compromised a lot by staying on calls, but he rarely texts me anymore. Even when I send sweet, or flirty messages. I feel emotionally disconnected and overstimulated a lot of the time, but when I ask for more texting. He seems unhappy. I don’t think he’s trying to hurt me, but this is becoming a bigger issue. I feel lonely and unseen. How do I communicate my needs to him better?*\n\n  \nHi there everyone, this is my first post on Reddit. I’m (F/28) in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (M/23) of a year, and I could really use some advice. We have not met IRL yet, he is in TX and I am in SC.\n\nWe’ve been together for a year now and we’re struggling a little bit. I think, in short, he and I have very different communication styles. I understand a lot of this is on me as I have an anxious attachment style, and I’ve been working very hard to heal it. I’m aware of the issue, and when I see myself spiraling, I do my best to distract myself or work through it on my own.\n\nHe works long hours at a job where he can’t really be on his phone to text, but he can keep an earbud in to talk most of the time. We also have very different schedules. He’s an early bird, and I tend to be more of a night owl. He usually goes to bed around 6:30 PM to 9 PM at the latest, whereas I’m usually up until 12–1:30 AM.\n\nHe’s the kind of person who enjoys being on the phone all day and night. I’ve never been like that but I’ve really been trying to meet him where he’s at. Because I’m autistic, I need a lot of quiet time to recharge. Being on the phone constantly can get overwhelming and overstimulating for me. Draining almost. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being with *him.* I just start to feel like I have no space to myself. And I really do mean that we are on call *all day*—there have been times we’ve stayed on the phone (or Discord) for weeks straight. It’s become a regular pattern for us.\n\nHere lies the issue: I do really like texting. My love language is words of affirmation. His is quality time. I like sweet text messages, I like pet names, and I want to be able to reread our messages when I find myself stuck in an anxious cycle. That, above all else, is extremely grounding to me. I’m not sure if that’s healthy or not, but I’m sure you all will tell me in the comments. I don’t really expect constant replies from him or big emotional messages.\n\nTo explain another layer of this: he and I met on a platform where roleplay is very popular. I really do enjoy roleplaying—I love to write and read, and it made me feel incredibly close to him. He was amazing at it, and looking at the stories we got to write together is super moving.\n\nBut now, we don’t have a lot of overlap in free time. I guess I only get a few hours with him lately. He told me when we first met that he was bad at texting, and I told him I was bad at being on the phone. We laughed about it. But now we spend a lot of time on the phone and *pretty much no time texting.*\n\nBecause of his work schedule and the fact that he really can’t be on his phone, I often look at our messages and see many unanswered. He’s really bad about answering me. On top of that, he’s really bad about just responding to the last message I sent and ignoring all the rest of them—or not responding at all and just saying “Call?”\n\nHe’s now very dry through text, when he was once very affectionate with me. I would say on average, I get about five texts a day from him, even when we’re not in a Discord call. Things have changed a lot since we first met. He has a new job now where, for a while, he was waking up around 2:30 AM for work. He works a lot harder now, and he’s a lot more tired. For that, I *do* feel bad—I know he’s stressed, and I don’t want to add to his stress.\n\nWe’ve talked and argued about this. I’ve tried to bring this up to him gently. I don’t know what to do, because I *do* feel lonely a lot of the time, even when we’re on the phone. We often don’t actually talk much. He’s working and is focused on that, or he (sometimes both of us) are gaming and distracted with that. Then he goes to bed, and I’m alone for hours after.\n\nI don’t really feel understood or heard right now.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research and seen a lot of content about other couples in LDRs. One of the biggest things they always say is “be on the phone all or most of the time.” It makes me feel *guilty* for needing breaks from it. I want to connect with him in other ways too. I feel like when I bring this up to him, it hurts him. Maybe he feels rejected.\n\nI’ve attempted many times to explain that I just need some downtime, or that I have a low social battery. My social battery has grown so much since he and I started dating. I’ve asked if we could text, or if we could roleplay.\n\nI’ve asked about roleplaying, and he’ll say that he wants to but he won’t post back to me. If I post again, he gives no indication that he’s even read it. He feels totally uninterested in that aspect of our relationship now, when it was once one of the things that made us both feel close to each other.\n\nWhen we do just text, he won’t really tell me things. So when I ask about his day, I get “Good” through text then later on the phone, he launches into the actual details. I know he’s tired and busy, but the way he saves everything for phone calls makes me feel shut out of his day. I want to feel included again in his life even if it is only in the small ways.\n\nWhen he was going to work so early, I was really harping on him to send me good morning/goodnight messages. With him working that early, we didn’t get to talk at all. I felt really distant from him, and it was hard on both of us.\n\nI thought good morning/goodnight messages might open a line of communication between us. As I mentioned, I’m autistic, and that change in his schedule really rocked my world. For a year, his schedule was set in stone, and we had our little rituals. All of that got disrupted. Little to no of those rituals have returned since that shift. I feel like we lost a lot of the little things that made us feel like us.\n\nWith some pestering, he *did* start the good morning/goodnight messages. They often feel flat and I know he wouldn't be doing it if I hadn't have asked for it. But now he just seems really unhappy whenever we’re texting, and now it’s built into this huge thing in my head.\n\nThings have been rocky for like three months now. Am I wrong for craving texting still? How do I bring back the spark? I’ve tried to excite him with dirty text messages, but often those go unnoticed for a long time too, and it hurts my feelings.\n\nI don’t think he’s doing any of this on purpose, but I also don’t think he understands why it bothers me so much. I think to him, being on the phone is just better, and he doesn’t understand how it *wouldn’t* be that way for everyone.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nI feel like I’ve really worked on compromising. I’ve worked on being better at communicating on the phone. I’ve worked on asking to call first more often and on managing being on for so long. Part of me really wishes he would notice that and put more effort into some of the things I’ve been asking from him.\n\nWe’ve been fighting more and more, and I’m honestly very afraid of losing him. He is great in so many ways, but this one issue has really been slowly building into a bigger and bigger one. It’s seeped into every aspect of our relationship. Our sex life has truly died as well.\n\nAs I mentioned in my original post, I’m still fairly new to Reddit. I decided to take that post down so I could rewrite and include some more details that I felt were important. I’m also reposting from a throwaway account because the last thing I want is for my boyfriend to come across it and feel hurt or embarrassed. My goal here really is to just get advice and perspective from others who might be dealing with something similar on our situation, not to make him feel bad in anyway.

{"id": "u/Redbrushan_1250", "user": "u/Redbrushan", "text": "I (29F) need advice for dealing with LDR with my boyfriend (25M) who is doing an MBA\n\nI apologise for the long write-up and thanks to anyone who can advice on this. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got together this March, we met through work. He was planning to get into MBA since last year, luckily he got into a good college and left in June, and we're in LDR since then. We decided we'll meet as soon as he gets his internship finalised which will be in October first week, because MBA is quite busy and the first few months are really challenging and important. I've battled depression for a long time, but since he has appeared, he has always been absolutely amazing at being there for me and taking care of the small things even though he's far. He is a pretty optimistic person and keeps telling me we've a future together even though I get cynical at times. Overall I feel safe and happy being with him, and I feel we can thrive together. \n\nBut lately something has been bugging me. He isn't very quick at opening upto people so at his college he has made a sole female friend so far. I always felt that lady had her eyes on him, but he kept reassuring me that she doesn't, and always emphasized on how she's the only one he can talk to. He does have some male friends as well but he says they aren't very good at understanding emotions. \nThere was one time when I called him and he said he's studying with people and we disconnected call. 15-20mins later he called me again and said he was studying with that girl, and he lied because he felt I would be angry if I got to know. He then promised he won't repeat it and we didn't talk about it again. But I could never really let that out of my mind and always felt uneasy about it.\n\nRecently he told me that other students have been teasing that girl by pairing her and my boyfriend together, and that she was frustrated because of that. Then he said she asked him to meet and talk, where she told him that she ACTUALLY had a thing for him. My boyfriend told me he cut off the friendship with her, because being friends meant giving her hope. \nAfter that day, he's been very annoyed and told me multiple times that he feels alone now, because his only friend is gone, but at the same time he can't talk to her either because he doesn't want to give her hope. I tell him that he can always talk to other friends, and he agrees, but then comes back to feeling lonely again. He says he's sad it had to turn out like this because that girl isn't a bad person. Since the last 3 days we haven't spoken as much because he's always annoyed, and if we talk, this situation is all we have talked about. And I am really not sure how to deal with this because in my head I know it's something that can happen with anyone and I have been trying my best to give him the comforting words and be as understanding as possible, but it keeps bugging me how he keeps talking about it and nothing else when he talks. He says he doesn't have any romantic feelings for her at all and that I've nothing to worry about but seeing how disoriented he has been ever since the incident, I don't know anymore how should I feel about it. \n\nAm I overthinking this? I hear all the time how people go to MBA colleges and eventually cheat on their partners because of the stress and the fact that they see so many options, without the risk of being discovered, and that makes me incredibly anxious.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I truly feel like he is my soulmate. We are best friends and have so much fun together. I have anxious attachment and he has taught me so much in the process. But, we just now made things serious. He has talked to my son on the phone and we officially started dating/ he was skeptical at first but he wanted to make sure we were solid before he even spoke to him and told him see you thanksgiving! It was a slow burn and we took things slow. He will be coming to see and meet my family during thanksgiving. I met him organically and it’s like we just clicked. We have both healed parts of eachother. He is a avoidant attachment and at first pushed me away multiple times. He was in a dark place. I was the first person that made him feel safe. I looked through his phone/ he literally spoke to no one and had one friend. We had some issues with communication but once I told him what I needed from him he calls me everyday. He also is taking 6 classes in a masters program and is packed. We talk alot about the future and our plans. He finally met some new friends and there was a incident where he went to this girls house with his friends and while they were there a girl made a comment that made everyone uncomfortable because the girl had a boyfriend. He still chose to stay when his friend left leaving just him and the girl to go the bar as friends because they both have significant others he didn’t see a big deal because we trust eachother/ the girls boyfriend was pissed, he FaceTimed me and I tried to act chill but then things took a turn and the girl ended up trying to do stuff with him, she didn’t make it obvious but she knew what she was doing and he explained he had to get out of the situation because this was her first time drinking he FaceTimed me the whole night the girl even talked to me on FT but wouldn’t let him leave this was his first time hanging with her as they all met in class , but after that incident I told him that’s a boundary my man should never be alone drinking with a girl regardless???? So, we moved past that. He did FaceTime me the whole night and the girl just wouldn’t leave him alone she was 21 and now they don’t speak to her. Then there was an incident where he was on FaceTime with me and his friend called and said look what that girl sent me (he said the girls name from that night) and said to me remember that crazy bitch? I said yeah. and sent him a screen shot and he said I’m gonna call you back and I said no what’s the picture? His friend said a big booty girl and I said I’m going to bed. He started to blow my phone up, and was wanting to know why I was upset. He said is it cause he said her name and big booty girl? I said no what am I upset about? And then I acted like that’s what it was and he let out a gasp of relief and said wooh I thought it was something else, he just talks sometimes. So then he goes on later to say to me I need to be honest and I can’t lie to you, the picture he sent was where the crazy girls friend said that my boyfriend was cute and to see if he was interested he said he just didn’t want me worried about another girl. So fast forward to yesterday he calls me every night he said he’s at his friends cousins house for her birthday. He calls me at the birthday and I said you have fun I’m going to sleep he says why are u in a rush to get off the phone? He tells me he’s going home at 12. Fast forward he never goes home, he’s at the bar and then ends up back their house and stays the night. It’s his friend and his fiance and her cousin. The next day I told him it’s a boundary I don’t want my man to stay the night anywhere. He also mentioned the finance and her husband are so toxic and that when the husband wasn’t looking the finance was being friendly with my man. So today he reassures me that it won’t do anything that’s gonna bother me and that he understands and that it’s not what it seems it’s just college friends drinking and then crashing at their place. But he understands my boundary and said if it’s bothering me he wouldn’t do it. At this point I’m lowkey checked out he calls me and says I’m feeling anxious and just wanted to hear your voice idk why and then we talked about it again and he said why do u give me ultimatums and I said it’s boundaries. So then he FaceTimes me before the beach party and says I’ve noticed the past couple days you haven’t really been talking to me , you’ve been very short. He explains that they were great host ( his friends cousin and his wife and her cousin) and he said tonight after the beach party they are prolly gonna stay there or at his house because they are gonna drink and his friend doesn’t need to drive then goes on to explain that I’m overthinking and the situation is nothing like I think it is and he’s not gonna say he has to go home because his girlfriend is insecure and he said I should trust him and he should trust me and that I’m overthinking and that this is the problem with long distance and he said they are great hosts and you don’t find good people like that these days but also last night was talking about how literally the guy and his finance hit eachother and that the fianace tried to grab my man’s arm at the bar and was being really friendly.  He says we should trust eachother and that I’m overthinking it and it’s not like that and that he’s gonna FaceTime me tonight and he will show me everything and keep me updated.

My heart has been yanked and trampled on..\n\nAfter 3 years of LDR and 4 months of LDM (Marriage) my wife told me and I quote \n\n“You don't understand my point of view. Yes, I don't feel anything, all I feel is emptiness. In fact, I feel like I don't need a man or a companion because I can do it all by myself. There's no difference between having a partner or not for me. In the end, I also have to fight alone. But I also realize, I don't need anyone's help. It might be strange for you, but I've been in survival mode for years. What you're fighting for isn't me, that's my opinion. That's why I don't really care about our relationship anymore because for the past week, I feel like I can do without anyone. The wounds of the past two months have really left a deep scar. And maybe now is the peak.”\n\n..all because 2 weeks ago she wanted me to pay her trip to Hong Kong worth £450. And whilst money isnt an issue for me right now, I preferred to not spend them. Not because I don’t love her, it was because we can save money so once we apply for the UK spouse visa, I will have plenty of savings. \n\nYou see, I’ve never denied her anything (for the most part). During the past 3+ years we have travelled extensively, been to 10 different countries, visited many regions within set countries. I bought her the new iphone, have helped her many times when she would be sick, even though I wasnt physically there. Just food orders etc. \n\nNow she doesn’t want to talk to me, thinks am stingy and have made her feel like a “beggar”. But again, the reason why I denied her a trip to HK was because am trying to save up as much money as possible before we apply for a visa. All of the financial burden falls on my shoulders :( \n\nAm really distraught and sad, I’ve gone through a lot to make her happy and she now she brushes me off so casually. \n\nFor context, am based in the UK and she is from Indonesia. \n\nEdit: she just sent me this \n\n“You won, but you lost me. You lost my respect, my love, my trust, and my comfort and all. It's up to you what you want to say, but all I want now is just be away from you. It might hurt at first, but it will feel better later. I hope my absence gives you peace. I feel you Made me being too much and i hate it the most so i wanna keep my peace without you arround”\n\nafter I sent her a 10 min voice recording in which I spoke at length regarding the pressing issues and that I want her to go on the holiday. That despite me disagreeing with her choice, I will pay for it because her happiness is more important to me than the money. \n\nAm feeling so hopeless right now", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Throwaway account because my friends use reddit and i need a username that doesn’t trace back to me lol. Sorry for the long post ahead!\n\nI met my BF when I was 17 and he was 18. It was right out of the pandemic and I was also coming from a bad break up that I reunited with my highschool classmate during one of my closest friend’s bday party, lets call him Ray. \n\nRay transferred to another school before I could actually meet him so our interaction was very chill and surprised that we knew each other despite not being in the same circles. After catching up for like a week, he introduced me to his friends from his different school, thats where I met my BF, lets call him Eric. \n\nMy first interaction with Eric was actually just in a voice call lol and we bonded over playing video games (it wasnt just us but Ray and his other friends were there). While in a game, I would talk flirtatiously to Eric because I was bored and single so why not…It was i guess 2 weeks of accompanying each other that we were all in a vouce chat, chilling, playing games, watching a movie, etc. This was around June 2022. \n\nThe next month, July, I had my 18th bday celebration but alot of my invited guests canceled and couldnt come, so I just invited Eric and 2 more ppl. While at the party, I kept being touchy with Eric and just being playful in general. After that day, thats when we started to really talk and flirt one another. I wont write abt how we started exclusively dating, we just went out on a lot of dates for 1 month and he asked me to be his gf, yada yada..\n\nFast forward to 7 months of being official, the same friend that had a bday party where I met Ray, lets call her Kate! She invited Eric and I to a sleepover party…And this is where everything went down hill…We were all tipsy and in the dining room table it was Me, Eric, Kate, and another friend Joe. \n\nThe conversation was something like truth or dare and when it was my turn I chose, truth. Kate then proceeded to ask “do i still think abt my exes?” (nonverbatim because i dont remember the exact question, it was 3yrs ago!) I stupidly said yes and a name. Eric was beside shocked and quiet then he went out to the garage and started punching the wall…He was with 2 other guys as soon as he went out so thankfully it was stopped immediately…\n\nMeanwhile, Me, Kate, and Joe discussed what I did wrong, that I didnt have to answer it. I completely acknowledged my fault and after a few hours of calming down, Eric and I talked outside…We were able to resolve the problem, discussing boundaries and where I went wrong.\n\nAfter this event, Ive realized how Eric frequently had panic attacks and depressive episodes when I was not ok or in general, in our relationship. For example, I am the type of person who keeps myself busy when I feel sad. So, if we fight I usually log off the internet and do some homework. I have already told Eric this attitude of mine as soon as I started dating him. \n\nAnother terrible instance we had, was around our 1yr anniversary. We took a whole week break from one another because it was becoming overbearing to carry his issues plus mine… there was a mention of his ex at that time…and we realized that we were not each others ideal type—it really hard to accept that. We knew we were not mentally stable but couldnt afford therapy to help us (keep in mind that throughout our relationship we are college students) \n\nDuring this break, we still said our good morning and asked what we were doing. He was unable to eat because of the anxiety and depression he was feeling. While I tried to unpack my feelings for him with a friend. This friend told me to break up with him because it felt like Eric was “manipulating” me emotionally. After that week, we tried to get things back to normal. \n\nBut there were a lot of instances that I would open up to my friends abt our relationship problems or even blurting out that “I was tired (of our rs)” while I was drunk. All my friends advised me to just break up with him. I stayed because I thought that in the future these problems would be fixed or maybe I also did not have the gut to break up with him and be alone again…asshole i know\n\nFast forward again to our 2nd year. This was the closest we had to breaking up hahah…I am an extroverted person and when I try to become friends with others, Eric always has a stern look and tells me to tone it down a bit. This was due to me having an incident of cheating, it was only one time and it wasn’t during my relationship with Eric but with another ex which was in 2020. \n\nInitially, I felt very limited with Eric thats why I told him we need to take a break again. It was 2 weeks of minimal communication. Another friend told me that if I was staying just because of the friends I made in Eric’s group then it isnt worth staying. \n\nAdmittedly, I did say that, my life has been completely intertwined with Eric’s, my friends were his friends and it felt like the most safe space I have ever had, even better than the friends I made from uni. \n\nYet, again when I was ready to tell Eric to break up I just bursted out crying and could not go through with it. \n\nNow, I am currently having doubts about our relationship. I feel very disconnected from Eric, he isnt that clingy as he gives me my space and we dont usually go out anymore as with financial instability. These doubts come in waves sometimes its for a couple of days then I dont remember it not until I feel distant from him again. I have to also confess that I tried to use anonymous chat sites just to feel thrill ??? \n\nTL;DR: I really dont know whether I should still stay because at this point our families know each other, he has even given me a puppy for my 21st (i love dogs but i didnt want it because I live in a small apartment with 2 of my family members), and our friends are the same. \n\nI know he doesnt deserve a partner who has half hearted feelings but whenever I tell him this he says its fine and we can work through it. But I fear that I can no longer attempt to fix broken glass…\n\nI dont know who to confide in, so reddit help me :(", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He’s been really stressed with work and finances and managing a house on his own (even though his family live with him they don’t really help out and leave a mess that he has to clean up), he’s in a lot of pain and will potentially need surgery for an ongoing problem, not to mention the political climate (he lives in the USA). I’ve been struggling to find a full-time job, been recovering from surgery myself, the political climate here (UK) is scary and I’ve had some family issues going on. Not to mention we’ve both been feeling the distance a little more than usual. So we’ve both been really stressed and a little snappy with one another but we’ve always been able to circle back and talk it through.\n\nI’d just returned to my part time job yesterday after two months off, a six hour cleaning shift at a fairly popular gym and pool - so nothing too egregious but it was still a challenge for me because my surgery site was causing me some pain and there’d been some changes at the gym that I had to adapt to.\n\nMy partner also works Saturdays (overtime) and after which he would call me. This call comes through at around 8-9pm my time. My partner called me at this time yesterday but I was still at work, no big deal I just assumed he forgot and sent him a message reminding him. He then replies ‘yes but you still could’ve answered’ - which, for the record, unless it was an emergency I really couldn’t have. I have to be on the go the entire time because my managers think 6 hours is plenty of time to do 12 hours worth of work. But he sent the ‘👀’ and ‘what if I was dying’ so I just assumed it was meant to be a joke.\n\nI joked back that if it was an emergency knowing him I wouldn’t have found out until after it happened (which is true, there’s been a couple times where emergencies have happened and I’ve not found out until after they’ve been sorted) and, just in case he was being serious, told him that if it had been any other time I would’ve answered first thing or if he had spammed called me.\n\nHe doesn’t reply to my messages. I get home, call him, but he’s busy so we don’t really do anything. He texts me today saying he still would’ve appreciated if I’d have answered and that he ‘obviously knew I was working’ and that he ‘answers [my] calls when [he’s] working’ (which to my memory I’ve never called him while he’s working so maybe he has a point there) and that he shouldn’t have to spam call me to get through to me in an emergency. I acknowledged his point, apologised, and explained that if I had any inkling that it was an emergency and not just his regular end of day call I would’ve picked up on the first ring no hesitation. He then told me that it wasn’t an emergency and he just wanted to see if I’d answer so he knew who to call if it was, along with the 👍🏻 and 👌🏻 emojis which I thought was a bit petty.\n\nI reminded him that not once have I not answered his call - excluding the times it didn’t connect properly at which point I called him back straight away. And he’s left me on read.\n\nI find myself being angry because he knew this was my first day back at work in two months after surgery, that I needed to adjust to everything and see how the pain levels were on my surgery site, and he decided now was the best time to test me. And not only that he had me feeling guilty for missing an emergency when it wasn’t even an emergency, he just wanted to see if I’d be there for him which, in my opinion, I have been (I was there when he fell off a roof, I was there when his mum tried to off himself, I’ve been there for him and helping with financial issues whenever I could). But on the other hand if he genuinely felt the need to test me on this then I’m worried if I’ve somehow let him down somewhere.\n\nTLDR: partner called me on my first day of work in two months, then when I didn’t answer acted like it was an emergency that I’d missed, then told me it wasn’t an emergency he just wanted to see if I’d answer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Now, suddenly she is super interested in having a baby, because she feels she's becoming too old and all her friends are having babies.\n\nI have told her I'm not entirely opposed to having a baby but not at this stage. We are just not financially prepared for it and I don't see us being so anytime soon. She works casual shifts only a couple days a week, and we are renting in one of the most expensive cities in the world. And she is not willing to work more. She wants us to purchase a house but also does not want to work and wants to be a stay at home mum raising a child which is just not even remotely something doable in the current climate here with the current cost of living crisis. Is it fair for me to entirely reject the prospect of having children? How do I handle this situation? \n\nOutside of this our relationship is great, we're happy with each other and get along very well. But I can see this being a large rift. She becomes seriously depressed/dark when I reject this as a possibility.\n\nTLDR, partner wants a baby but doesn't want to work. I think it's not financially feasible.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We've known each other for about 3 years, after meeting online. He's been my rock that entire time, always doing what he could to comfort me through the ups and downs, and I to him. We drifted apart slightly, but recently had started talking more again. We started sleeping on call, and then calling almost every morning, playing games together. After a while, I realized I was developing feelings. I tried to ignore them, because every relationship I've been in, it was either toxic, or I just got my heart broken. I didn't want to open myself up to that again..but I couldn't keep my big mouth shut. I eventually told him, because he could sense I was anxious about something (said crush being the reason). He then also confessed, calling me \"my love\". As it progressed, he told me all the sweetest things, that he would prepare dinner for me every night and take care of me, sweet talk me in Spanish (calling me his universe, that he would do anything for me), spoil me in a game we played together, and assure me he loves me and one day we'll see each other, even saying he would order us matching bracelets and said he would send me one half. He wanted to be official, and I said I do too, but that I might need to wait a short bit, so we can talk about what that would look like, and to make sure I'm ready for another relationship, but that I know I love him dearly. He said \"And I'll wait as long as you need me to mi amor\". (I had actually planned on asking him to be official shortly before, all this that happened. I know that sounds contradictory, I had just realized \"I want to be with him\" sooner than I thought I would, after that conversation).\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nI started trying to save for the trip to visit him during this, ($600-$1000, though money is hard right now), and I'd look forward to all of his texts, just wanting to talk to the love of my life. Soon enough he started college again, and we had less time together- one time he didn't text me for 2 days, but posted on his Social media story.. Which kind of hurt, but I figured he's busy with more important things.\n\nBut, recently, he told me that it's best if we're \"just friends for now\". He \"doesn't want to upset me by not having time for me\", \"I don't think I can do long distance\", \"He still wants to talk as friends and play games and stuff\".. Acting like nothing we talked about mattered. After everything he said. After telling me himself he wanted to be with me.\n\nHe said \"You don't have to wait for me, go find someone and be happy\".. but I can't. My trust feels shattered, even though I know he said \"friends for now\", and not \"I don't love you anymore\". It feels like everything he said is a lie now. I don't know what to trust. I'm torn between still working towards our goal of moving in together, and being with him, or just throwing everything away and giving up on ever finding someone who loves me. I have some money saved up, but I might have to use it so my electricity doesn't get shut off.\n\nHe said \"I don't want to say something confusing, thats not fair to you\".. After all that. After months of talking and promising he loves me and that he can't wait to see me one day, and living together. Why would you say that.. now..?\n\nHe also keeps posting things on his story, like posts of \"I love you like I love ___\", and a post saying \"Life is too short, confess to your crush\" with a song called \"i hope you're okay\" playing on the story. I've been just avoiding his stories, and that social media since I saw that because it hurts too much. I want him in my life but I can't even keep a conversation with him without bursting into tears.\n\nI know he said it's not over, \"just for now\" but why?? You were fine being together a week ago, why not now..? Why reciprocate if you're not even sure?\n\nI guess I'm just venting to the void. I don't know what to do, besides rot here. I don't think anyone will actually love me. And that's fine. I just don't want to be promised the world then have it ripped  away in a single morning.\n\nIf you want to leave advice, feel free, just please be nice. I can't handle much else right now.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We met online during lockdown (in the same town). Our relationship has been akin to an LDR with how little we see each other IRL, since we’ve both been living with our overbearing parents. On average, it was once or twice a month.\n\nI’m away at university in a new city and he’s just started a new job back home. The physical distance is still awful, but it’s never been an issue since we would talk to each other every second we’re available. He used to wake up and go to sleep much later than me, which was fine. I’m autistic and tend to get overwhelmed at night, so it was nice that he would always be awake before I went to sleep to calm me down. Now, his job has him waking up at 4:00am my time, and going to sleep earlier than me. \n\nI hate the change so much. I miss knowing I would still have time with him after coming home from evening outings. I’ve been sitting at my laptop waiting for him to get home and I’m often unable to do anything else because I get so anxious. I’ve been crying every night since our routine has changed. I’m torn between trying to socialize at university or missing out on activities to spend time with him while he’s awake. \n\nEnding the relationship is not an option. I’m going to marry him one day.

The beggining was a roller coaster, until we decided to formalize, before that our relationship was just like a game, lying, playing, not serious. Since then I didn't trust him but I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and it's been difficult but not impossible. Then I fcked up. Few months ago I told him I was going sleep, but a girl friend called for an ''emergency'' and I didn't tell my partner, he send me a text and told him I was outside. This happened twice. I know this time it was my fault and even when I apologized several times, he hasn't forgotten. I know I can't force him, but whenever he can, he reminds me that he doesn't trust me, and this happens almost everyday. Today we had a missunderstanding, when I sent a message to clarify things he just texted me 'I don't feel comfortable with you anymore' and hasn't replied to my message. \n\nSometimes I overthink and think that he has someone else, because his behaviour is getting incredible weird, but I don't know how to prove it. Besides, we've been together for almost 3 years long distance now, I don't want to give up so easily. \n\nBut I don't know what to do anymore. It's getting tiring, but I love him.

I’d like to keep specific details anonymous, but me and my ex were together for a year with a 5000 mile distance, having made multiple visits. We’ve been broken up for a month as of today. A couple of weeks before the break up she’d asked me for a break, and I told her there were no breaks. A couple of weeks later, she blindsided me, by taking advantage of the fact that I was always sexually open. I think I might’ve been in so much denial I just didn’t think about how this might’ve had something to do with how she’d been acting lately. This guy she fucked wasn’t just “a random guy” she nuked every boundary I’d set, labeled me controlling, downplayed all of the effort I’d ever made for her that she’ll more than likely never see met in another person. Though I really didn’t want to, I broke up with her because instead of coming home from work the next night and talking things out like she said she would, she went to spend the night at his house again. She told me the flowers I’d sent her a week prior felt like I was “buying her love” and I’ll honestly never forget that. She made me the bad person for buying her flowers in the first place, that they reminded her that I’m not really there. She could have cared less to see the true reality considering the fact I had already purchased ANOTHER plane ticket to come back and see her in just a couple of months.\n\nI had my own personal unresolved issues going into the relationship that certainly affected some things, but as someone who responds to pressure instead of doing the right thing and communicating her feelings, and working through things as true family should, she talked to friends instead of me. Friends who hated me in the first place out of jealousy, I’d always been quite suspicious these friends hated me but she’d always find a way to make it sound like they were supportive when only in the very end, she finally admitted they wanted her to dump me since day one of her talking to them again which was about 6 months ago now. In all honesty she sabotaged the relationship the moment she didn’t cut these friends off who never respected our relationship in the first place. From everything I gathered she was peer pressured by a specific friend into talking to this new guy behind my back, convinced she wasn’t a bad person for it knowing damn well in reality how evil it was doing this to me. Over the final month of our relationship, my paranoia grew more and more and my anxious attachment had been more out of control than it had ever been because I knew something was off. She’d constantly spend less and less time on FaceTime and the time left she would spend with me would often be her telling me how much she’s hurting and that she needs something now because she couldn’t wait any longer. One time it got so bad that I busted out crying, and I told her if you want out then I get it but you need to tell me because I feel like I’m hurting you by keeping you in this relationship. She acted as if that wasn’t at all what she tried to say, she said “I had no idea I was making you feel this way” knowing damn well my reaction made her guilt catch up to her in the moment, might’ve even considered the fact my replacement wasn’t solid enough to monkey branch to yet.\n\nI’m not sure when or if she’ll ever fully understand what she did here, her family was beyond disappointed in her, and my family now hates her to death too. I originally lied to my family when we broke up telling them “we simply couldn’t do long distance anymore” because I loved her so much didn’t want my family having a bad image of her and she said the same thing to hers. But she decided to post this new guy on her instagram the next day and that’s when everyone saw what really happened including her own family. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE saw her differently after that, but I guess that’s because both families watched as I actively put in an endless amount of effort for the year we were together, only for her to start hanging out with these piece of shit friends that didn’t respect me, multiple days a week until she finally fed into them labeling me as a control freak. Decided to start agreeing with them and telling them our issues instead of communicating with me. For the first visit, I signed my final contract with a company I had a great reputation with, she’d never seen anyone suddenly generate this large of an amount of money, but it was the last time I’d be doing that because it wasn’t a stable way to guarantee plans see through. I always told her that through out my life I’d learned that life can actually be magical and that instead of questioning how this was possible, that it’s important to take in that it was actually happening because we both believed hard enough. For the second visit where she came to me, I worked my fucking ass off, saving up for her travel expenses, my family even put together some money to help with it too. Normally, I would’ve expected her to pay for expenses, but she’d been fired from her job, and we’d already planned when this second trip would happen and I was set, I cut her some slack and got to work. I always used the word adventures to label our trips where we’d fly half way across the world to be together, only for her to now reuse that word with this new guy after we broke up, to her an adventure is now taking the long way home from the store and driving super fast and what we experienced together was nothing more than some lousy trips.\n\nI always wonder the day she’ll truly face the reality of her behavior towards me, but right now she’s feeding into what her shit friends and this new guy say about me because she’s a fucking pussy, and I’m gone for good this time. I blocked her on everything after she blocked me so she couldn’t just unblock me AGAIN with a fake apology, only to lead me on for a week before deciding to pick the easier, weaker option. In a year I’ll be living the future we planned together, only it’ll be on my own, or maybe with someone new. \n\nAt some point I needed to stop stalking her social media. I realized that I’d see what she’d post and it would just make me go buy another 5th of gray goose to slam that day. It’s been a little over a week now since I gave into the temptation of looking, but right now I have to go back to work to finish paying off a loan for a plane ticket I sadly won’t be using. I’ve had a great friend of mine who started going to the gym with me regularly which has been very helpful and I’m not sure if he even knows how much it’s meant to me. I’m still buying a 6 pack every couple of days but I’ve completely cut off my consumption of liquor.\n\nShe was much younger than me and early into adulthood which meant immaturity. I think part of me will always be understanding of her actions despite the fact that I didn’t behave this way when I was at her stage in life, and no matter how much I want to, I can’t find it in myself to feel actual hatred towards her despite how I was treated in the end. \n\nOn a final note, as I navigated through all of my feelings and emotions, I had to create my own unique closure to this evil betrayal. In order to find closure, I made an agreement with myself. She’s welcome to come back later on down the road, but on the condition that she must work hard, and pay for her own traveling expenses this time, and I will not be making the first visit again. Some of you may think “well that’s fucking stupid, how does that give you closure?” In all honesty, I feel comfortable moving on accepting the fact that upon putting this condition on her, either 1 year from now or 10 years from now, she simply wouldn’t be willing to reciprocate the effort that I once put in for her. I’m moving on with the understanding that she will never be the person I believed in upon randomly meeting her online on a random night over a year ago.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I did a tik tok if you want to check it out”. \nSo I did. \n\nIt was her miming to a weird song, but she captioned it “reason #17635 I can’t be successful on dating apps”.\nI commented passive aggressively with “or the fact you’re not single”.\n\nFast forward to is saying goodnight (she’s in the US and it was late). \nWe ended our call and later she messaged me with this:\n\n“You know something I’m trying to be open with you, but I’m really craving that physical touch that having someone here and it kills me…and no I haven’t looked or tried anything because I love you I’m not trying to disrespect you cause it’s not fair to you. I just want to let you know how I feel and where my mind goes in all this. Again I’m not saying this to make you feel bad or anything I just wanted you to know how I feel that is all. I love you so much that it hurts to know we can’t be together on a physical base wise.”\n\nWith everything else going on - I reacted to her message in a way that I think landed wrong. \n\nI replied: “I get that. I’m in the same boat with you. \nIf you want to go, don’t stay just because you love me. \nDo what you want to do. \nI love you but I won’t make you stay if it’s too hard”\n\nThen she came back saying I’ve asked her to open up with me and this is the reason she doesn’t. \n\nThe thing is, I’m ALWAYS there when she needs me. She says she’s there for me but generally it’s not in the way I need despite me telling her this. \n\nAm I the asshole?\nI know I’m reactive today and I have since apologised more than once. \n\nShe said it’s ok and that’s it. \n\nI feel like I’m losing the one person I have ever loved.

I am at my wits end, what can I even do if I’ve communicated everything?\n\nA lot of the time we argue it’s because of tone or “jokes” that I clearly state affect me especially when I’m feeling sensitive. I try my best to manage my cptsd and hormonal issues but if I’m going to be around someone a lot I want them to truly take those things into consideration. I’m never asking him to “heal” me or anything.\n\nThe “jokes” I mention are super anxiety inducing for me. For example earlier, we were going to spend time together and I said okay in a bit I just want to play this game after you. He tossed his phone out of his hand kinda and sighed and stuff like that automatically puts me in fight or flight, I can’t help that.

He seems to only think it’s funny when I take it seriously. \n\n\nIt leads always to a huge argument where we’re just snowballing and hashing things out and it’s miserable. It never stops.

She is 22, has a child from her previous relationship and I am 27, no kids, and I’m living in eastern Europe. \n\nThings went on a wrong path fast, like 2 weeks after she started complaining that she didnt received her salary that month and was sad because it was her son’s birthday and she cannot buy a gift for him. I told her that it’s too early for me be able to just send her money. She apologised, saying that she was only mad  and compaining about it, not asking me to give send her.. (I heard about this move before, when a girl wont ask you straight but she would have ‘problems’ that will make you feel sad, sorry, pitty). Anyway excluding that night she never asked again.\n\nThings were going pretty well after, so I came up with an idea to make things became real, even for a little bit. She said that she never received flowers before, so I lied to her that I need  her adress to search for airbnb in the future in that area bla bla and I managed to surprise her with flowers, and some small gift. To be honest, I sent her that 50% because I wanted to be the first person to give her.. and 50% to see that she will post something about it on social media. I know that a girl will brag about it and post it on social media, and she did post it, with a cute quote etc. After like a week she deleted all the photos with the flowers, and when I asked her why she said that she wanted to post them again, to feel like she just received them but she didnt. She post a picture on her story after, and she deleted after I saw the story.. That day I really started questioning myself, if I’m insecure? I’m it’s only in my head? And I continued talking to her..\n\nHer ex husband family was still around, and she was still fighting with them on social media, and that made me more insecure.. I tried to talk with her, to tell her that I dont feel ok seeing her living her past life and be sad again and again. And I told her to stop doing that, and to focuss on the present & future. We had a small fight, she said that I’m pushing her to choose her past life instead of the future with me and again, I really thought it’s my fault..\n\nShe is working a lot from Monday - Friday, but in weekend she is free. Well in the lately weekends she kept dissapearing. Power outage for hours, internet outage, she is busy with house chores.. I said maybe it’s in my head again..\n\nIn the past few days things went really bad, I started to overthink a lot, because I was very serious about her, next month I was supposed to buy the flight ticket, and if everything was ok, to pay everything for her to visit here aswell. \n\nYesterday she texted me that she feels like I dont want to talk with her, and I told her that I dont feel ok, I feel like she is not honest with me. She sent me a printscreen of her convos from messenger, but I asked her to give me her password to look into it. She said that it’s toxic (I know this too, I never asked for this before, but I was very stressed) She said that she will do it only if I sent her mine first. She entered my facebook, she saw that I follow some girls from Philippines, that i texted some facebook friend of her  ( basic chatting, for 1/2 hours after I stopped) and she said that she doesnt trust me anymore. Well, when i tried to open her facebook.. she kept unapproving my login.. so I was not able to enter to see.. I said, fk it.. it’s toxic anyway.. I just told her that I trust her, and I still want to be with her..\n\nWell, today she started posting again mocking her ex husband again.. and I felt very bad..

I’m considering getting a divorce.\n\nMy husband and I are a long distance couple, we met here on Reddit while being in different countries and our relationship has mostly transpired at a distance (continents and time zones away). We have been together for almost two years and decided to get married two months ago.\n\nRecently, he came to the country I’m currently residing in for two weeks. Everything was ok, we had some disagreements but we worked through them. He’s always been the most patient and sweetest man to me. Since yesterday night was his last night here and I know how much he wanted to play board games and socialize, I invited the classmates from my postgrad program to my shared apartment to play games and drink.\n\nMy husband began drinking immediately and by the end of the night he had basically drank about 70% of all the alcohol by himself. I have seen him drink and hold his alcohol before so I trusted he knew his limits. However, last night I saw a version of him I have never seen and it has truly scared me. \n\nHe began being loud and slurring, then he said he wanted to go to a bar but since my friends were leaving and his flight requires us to be up early in the morning, I told him I don’t think it was happening. At around this time, one of my friends who had already left called me terrified and told me that a guy had followed her and was harassing her and that she’ll send me her location because she was extremely scared. I told her ok and offered to send a taxi if she needed for her to come back here but she said it was ok and a girl she saw on the street was helping her get home. \n\nI began putting away and cleaning the mess in the apartment while checking my friend’s live location. At this time, I noticed my husband putting on his shoes. I intercepted him at the door and asked where he was going and he said to the bar and I asked him if he was going alone and he asked if I to come with to which I replied no because we have to be up early tomorrow and he hadn’t even taken the keys and it’s dangerous to go out at this time. Then he went back into my bedroom while I cleaned and I thought everything would be ok, but then I saw him head out. After realizing it was too quiet while I tidied up I realized he had left the apartment completely. Soon after, he called me and was being incoherent so I asked him where he was and why he left. At this point I began crying because he had taken the only set of keys I had and I felt terrified of going out to search for him alone without my keys (without a way to return home if I was in danger, especially after what my friend had told me had happened to her).\n\nHe continued being incoherent and this went as a back and forth when he didn’t want to tell me where he was or was too drunk to. He kept hanging up and while that was happening I was also getting updates from my friend so I missed a couple of his calls. I called him back once more and he asked me WHAT DO YOU WANT? So I hung up. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to do, I called one of my classmates who also lives in this building and asked her for her keys because I wanted to go out looking for my husband. I was terrified for him because he had taken his phone, wallet and passport with him as well as the keys. Without hesitation, she and another classmate came over and offered to go out with me to search for him. \n\nThe three of us went out and sure enough there were guys in the street who catcalled and tried talking to us, we ignored them but honestly I felt extremely grateful for them being there with me in this situation. I was on the phone with my husband trying to get him to describe where he was but he was truly not making sense at all and I began to get frustrated, so one of my classmates offered to take the phone from me and try talking to him. She did and after walking for around 15 minutes we saw him stumbling in the middle of the street. We went to him and he immediately collapsed on the floor. \n\nHe laid there for a while, while we tried to wake him up and put him on his side. One of my friends went to get a glass of water and at this time a few passerbys had stopped to ask if everything was ok since it was a weird scene I guess: three women trying to move a guy on his side in the middle of the sidewalk at midnight on a weekday. We managed to get him awake and sitting up and tried giving him the water but he kept spitting it, so then we tried to get him up and moving towards the apartment building. My classmates were incredible, they helped hoist him up and pull him and help him walk (he was mostly shuffling while we carried his weight).\n\nDuring this time, he kept asking my friends where they were from and trying to talk to people on the street. He asked a group of guys if they had penises and also tried to talk to a homeless guy who was on the floor. We kept trying to keep him from engaging with people because he was being obnoxious. Then, he kept talking loudly to one of my classmates, he stopped and tried to grab her wrists while talking loudly to her. I saw her get visibly uncomfortable and I stepped in and told him hey please stop trying to grab her, don’t grab her like that. He looked at me and asked if I was mad and I just told him let’s keep walking. He then pushed me, not too hard but I did stumble. My friends told him not to be mean to me like that because I’m just worried for him and we’re just trying to get him home. He then said hey (my name) fuck off. It took every bit of me not to cry at that moment. I was already feeling extremely embarrassed about how he had been acting and about him trying to grab my friend and screaming at people in the street, but this was too much. \n\nWe continued walking and he screamed his head off on the way, shouting incoherent things. As we approached the building where I live, my husband suddenly took off running and we had to run after him, then he tried to pee at the door of the building and I had to stop him. There were police near the building and I wanted to avoid him getting arrested. We got him inside the building and he collapsed in the lobby in front of the elevators. We got him up and moving and then when we reached our floor he ran again towards the very end of the hall and again tried to pee. Again I had to run after him and literally shove his zipper back up again. I got him to the apartment and he entered my room and closed the door. I was left to thank my friends and say goodbye.\n\nI was afraid of what I would find in my room, but when I got in he was just passed out on my bed snoring. He briefly lifted his head when he sat me enter and said you don’t care about me. I hid behind my closet and sobbed for a few minutes wondering what the hell did I get myself into. This has been one of the most embarrassing and stressful experiences of my entire life. I can’t stop thinking that if it hadn’t been for my friends, I would probably still be out there without a key and a means to come home, exposed to who know what dangers, roaming the streets of the city searching for this man. I am terrified. \n\nI have to mention I also just underwent an invasive medical procedure which required me to not do physically exerting activities for a week or two and he knew this and still he had no qualms putting me in this situation. I have realized through this and other situations that this man doesn’t have any regard or compassion towards me at all. When he woke up after throwing up all over my floor, he dismissed what he did and said it was all easily solvable. He watched me almost puke all over myself while cleaning his disgusting puke off my floor. Yesterday night I didn’t sleep at all because of this and I felt the cramping this has caused on the area I was operated on throughout the day. I don’t think he understands how deeply this has altered the image I had of him, he is exactly like my father used to be with my mother and and that terrifies me. I am seriously considering getting a divorce soon.

My boyfriend (20m) and I (20f) have been together for about 1.5 years, we met in high school as seniors at different schools. Only a few months into dating, I moved to NYC last year for college and they stayed in our hometown many states away to take community college classes and work because their plans to go to school in Europe fell through. \n\n(Backstory). At one point, they had gotten a job that had room and board -2HRS time zone from me, and it was hell. We barely spoke and if I wanted to have a decent call I would have to stay up till 4am sometimes. Even then, it was like pulling tooth and nail to get them to spend time with me. I tend to be more anxious-attachment style while they’re more of an avoidant-attachment style. It also didn't help that I was trying a new medication for my depression and it was making everything worse. With all of that piling on top of each other, they finally made the switch to morning shift and it was way better. Moving on, that summer I had started working at a sleep-away summer camp and they moved back home from their job in the middle of the summer. The pattern of being distant and having to fight for them to talk to me started back up again, and it did that again when I moved back for college. I had another talk with them about how it felt like I was on a rollercoaster of us spending time with each other to no time at all, and my battle with wanting to stay together because I love them but that I wasn’t getting my relationship needs met. We discussed taking a break or breaking up, but neither of us wanted to do either. So we’re still working on things but it’s currently on an up.\n\nOnto how I’m feeling currently. I’m very proud of them and excited for uni to begin but I can’t help but feel nervous. Specifically, I'm the most nervous about us being so far away from each other, the time change, and how I'm worried they'll revert back to neglecting me. It’s completely different from last year now that they’ be 5 hours ahead and on a different continent. We’ve talked about both of our anxieties, but we know we love each other and want this to work. However, I need some outside opinions on what to do, especially those who have made LDR across continents work for years. What do y’all do to stay connected? Any good date ideas?

This post is very long, so I split it into sections w/ tldrs\n •\tThroughout the post I call my boyfriend “my bf.” \n•\tWe’re both a year ahead in school, so our ages don’t always line up with where we are in life.\n\n\nBEGINNING (Summer 2023) ———————————————— \nMy boyfriend (18M) and I (19F) started dating in May 2023, my senior year (I was 16), and his sophomore year (He was 15).  I knew who he was from being in show choir together but we only l first talked during a random fire drill in April 2023 where we bonded over complaining that we couldn’t get our licenses until senior year.\n\nSome background: I had just gotten out of a really bad relationship (abusive, messy, restraining orders, the whole deal). Because of that, when I started dating my current boyfriend, we kept it private because  we didn’t want my ex finding out and causing problems.\n\nAt first, neither of us wanted anything serious. He’s super independent, and I was about to move 8 hours away for college. But we started texting nonstop, and by May we were officially together. That summer ended up being so much more than I expected, we hung out constantly, laughed, had fun, and somewhere along the way we fell for each other. By July-ish, it wasn’t just a fling anymore. I had already committed to moving out of state for college, so we both decided to give long distance shot.\n\nTL;DR: Started dating right before I left for college. What was supposed to be casual turned serious fast, and we decided to try long distance.\n\n\n\n1ST SEMESTER (Fall 2023) ———————————————- \nBy fall 2023, I was a college freshman (17) and he was a high school junior (15). I moved in early August for sorority recruitment (I don’t go to a southern or SEC school so Greek-life where I’m at is more chill than the stereotypes). I was so ready to get away from my overbearing parents and finally have freedom. I’ve never really been into partying, so that part of the “college experience” wasn’t a thing for me anyway. I was busy adjusting, making friends, and trying to figure out how to survive lol\n\nSome important context (TW: mental health stuff): I was in a really rough place. Depression and anxiety aren’t new for me, but after dealing with my ex and some other stressors, I was at probably the lowest point I’ve ever been. My boyfriend has also struggled with mental health issues, and when we did talk, it was usually late at night, emotionally intense, and toxic (I’ll hurt myself if you hurt yourself kind of stuff)\n\nI ended up in a friend group of three guys and another girl from my classes. We mostly studied, but we’d hang for hours just chatting and joking around. At one point, I missed a session because I was admitted to the hospital overnight. I didn’t go into detail with the group, but the next morning I ran into one of the guys — let’s call him K. He noticed I wasn’t okay and offered to listen. Over time, I leaned on him emotionally a lot. He was stable, calm, and easy to vent to compared to how things were with my bf then.\n\nMy bf knew I had male friends, but not how emotionally close I’d gotten with K. I instinctively kept it vague because of my past with my ex. K and I never hung out alone, never had romantic or sexual contact, and we were very clear about boundaries (he knew I had a boyfriend) But we were emotionally close, and I depended on him in ways that looking back, do seem sketchy\n\nUnderstandably, when my boyfriend found out how close I was with K, he got upset. At the time, I got defensive and, in hindsight, made it worse. Not being upfront about it caused lasting trust issues. Even now, my bf brings it up sometimes. He still thinks I cheated, and there’s nothing I can say to completely convince him otherwise.\n\nTL;DR: Fall 2023 was rough. We were both emotionally unstable, our late-night venting was toxic, and I got really close with a male friend without being fully upfront with my bf. He thinks I cheated, but I didn’t.\n\n\n\n\n2ND SEMESTER + 2ND YEAR\n(Spring 2024–Spring 2025) ————————————————— \nAfter the chaos of Fall 2023, things finally calmed down. We were both a lot more stable mentally, and although our sleep schedules were still terrible, we were functioning. Neither of us failed classes or anything, but life felt a little more manageable.\n\nAt this point, I was a sophomore in college (18) and he was a senior in high school (16). The age gap was less of an issue now that he could drive, get a job, and I could rent Airbnbs when we visited. We got better at being independent and communicating, which made the long-distance part much easier.\n\nWe started seeing each other more regularly. Sometimes we split plane tickets and he’d stay in my dorm; other times I’d drive home for a long weekend. Being able to spend quality time together while still having our separate lives helped a ton. We were also better at handling conflict without spiraling like the previous semester.\n\nHonestly, this year really cemented our relationship. We both grew a lot, individually and as a couple.\n\nTL;DR: Things got easier. We were more independent, communicated better, and seeing each other became more manageable. Long distance wasn’t perfect, but it was sustainable.\n\n\n\nCURRENT (Summer 2025–Fall 2025) ————————————————————— \nSo my bf graduated high school (yay!) and I stayed in my college town over the summer to work. At this point, we’re 18 (me) and 17 (him), which made this summer a little tricky — no long breaks from long distance like we’d had before. Still, I was able to see him about every three weeks, which was doable.\n\nHe came up in July and stayed for nine days. This was the first real experience of living together. I still went to work, but we woke up together, cooked meals, went to the gym, and just hung out. Honestly, it was amazing. There weren’t any habits that really annoyed me just small stuff like stealing covers or leaving a plate in the sink.\n\nCurrently, I’m a junior in college (19) and he’s a freshman (just turned 18). He’s at a smaller state school about 1.5 hours from our hometown, technically closer than before, but still a 7-hour drive for me. He’s in a dorm, I’m in an apartment. We both have jobs and demanding majors, so free time is limited, but we make it work.\n\nTL;DR: Summer 2025 was our first real living-together test and we’re still making long distance work even with busy schedules.\n\n\n\nGUSHY STUFF \n————————— \nOkay, now that all the background’s out of the way, yes, we love each other. And I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t still be here if it was just infatuation or dumb teenage love\n\nWhen we first got together, nobody expected it to last. I was president of everything in high school, while he was more introverted, doing his own thing. I grew up in a small town where my family had a reputation and I’ve always been “so and so’s daughter.” My relationship with my parents is surface-level at best, all about grades, money, and appearances. I wasn’t used to being vulnerable or open emotionally, so making real friendships was tough.\n\nThen I met him. And I was blown away by how little he cared about what anyone thought. Not in an “I’m a loner” way — just that he was confident being himself and didn’t chase approval. From day one, we talked about the hard stuff: feelings, fears, hopes, everything. Being with him has changed me so much. I’m more genuine, less worried about impressing people, and I have friends who actually know me. I have a partner who loves me for me, and that’s huge.\n\nHe’s patient, kind, and supportive even when I’m emotionally messy. He encourages me to grow, believes in me, and doesn’t make me prove my worth. Despite him being younger, I look up to him constantly — he’s hardworking, passionate, and emotionally mature. Over 2.5 years, my love for him hasn’t faded. Long distance is hard, sure. I’ve doubted whether it could work. But I’ve never doubted that I love him, and we’ve never broken up or taken a break.\n\nTL;DR: We love each other deeply, it’s serious, mature, and not surface-level. Long distance is tough, but our relationship is real and lasting.\n\n\n\nCRITICISMS ————————— \n“What about the college experience?!” \nIf by “college experience” people mean partying, drinking, and hooking up, that’s never been my thing. I’ve gone to a few parties and a bar a couple times, but it’s just not my scene. I’ve still made friends, joined a sorority, play in a band, and have plenty of fun. My bf trusts me, I trust him, and our social lives aren’t limited by our relationship. Honestly, hearing about other people’s cheating and drama makes me so grateful for what we have. We know each other really well, and what we have is rare.\n\n“People change.” \nYes, and we’ve changed a lot. But so far we’ve only changed in ways that made us closer, more compatible, and better for each other and ourselves. We know we’ll continue to grow, and that’s fine. The important stuff  like values, life goals, political/religious views hasn’t shifted enough to matter. I hope we change- I know I don’t want to be the person I am right now in 5 years\n\n“But you’re so young.” \nYeah, we’re aware. We’re freshly adults, brains still developing, and all that. But we share goals, values, and a love that’s lasted 2.5 years so far. We’re not rushing into marriage or kids — that’s years away, when we’re financially and emotionally ready. I’m finishing my bachelor’s in 2027 then heading to grad school somewhere.  He graduates in 2029 and we’ll figure it out. We’re patient and committed, and neither of us wants to hold the other back. Sure, some people ask if I’ll drop out of college to be closer to him- I would never. He applied to the school I go to, but got a full-tuition scholarship elsewhere which would be stupid to turn down. Living close a couple years sooner isn’t worth sacrificing our career goals and finances.\n\n\n\nPROBLEMS \n——————— \nOne of the hardest things has been dealing with my family’s judgment. His family is supportive, but mine never were. From the start, they dismissed him because he’s younger, from a different family background, and “doesn’t have the same resources as us.” Both of my parents come from wealthy families, and have doctorate degrees, while neither of his parents went to college and they both work in industry jobs where they get paid by the hour. When we started dating he was 15, they made comments about him just wanting our money because he couldn’t pay for all of our dates. Keep in mind he was 15- not old enough to get a drivers license yet and his family only has one car. He couldn’t get a job because he was raising his younger siblings because one parent worked days and the other nights. They nitpicked his clothes, saying they weren’t fashionable or didn’t fit right (because all he had were hand-me-downs) They body-shamed him for being skinny, saying things like, “Don’t you want a real man who can pick you up and swing you around?” which is ridiculous because he’s 6 feet tall, just skinny because his family literally didn’t have access to enough food. Plus I’m not superficial enough to choose a partner solely off looks (regardless I think my boyfriend insanely attractive) The one that hurts him the most is refusing to get to know his parents because they aren’t part of the same social circle. It all makes me so sick to know that my own parents could treat someone who means so much to me this way.\n\nIt kills me because none of that even comes close to who he actually is. He’s smart, driven, responsible, and works his ass off , paying for college himself, working full-time, and still pursuing his passions as well. But my family judges him like he’s failing at life because he doesn’t fit their idea of “success” or come from the right background. They’ve never bought him a birthday or Christmas gift, never invite him to holidays or dinners, and still treat him like he’s just a friend. It’s insulting, and sometimes it makes me wonder if they’ll ever see him for who he really is.\n\nWatching him work so hard breaks my heart. He barely sleeps, forgets to eat, and pushes himself so he can succeed. It’s not sustainable, and I constantly worry he might have to quit school because he literally can’t afford it. And if that happens, I know my family won’t understand why I’m still with him — they’d probably see it as proof he isn’t good enough.\n\nTL;DR: My family constantly judges him for age, money, and background, completely ignoring his intelligence, work ethic, and character. It’s frustrating, unfair, and exhausting — but despite all this, he’s hardworking, responsible, and our relationship is stronger for it.\n\nIf you actually read this far- wow because I typed a lot. if anyone has advice for dealing with all the negative shit people say and issues with my family please let me know.

{"id": "u/annnaabanaanana_486", "user": "u/annnaabanaanana", "text": "Need advice about a medium distance relationship with someone who works a lot :( Loving relationship but feels like we'll end up drifting apart\n\nHi all! I'm looking for any advice about my situation. I've been stressing and freaking out for days and I have no clue what to think or do. My boyfriend (22y/o) and I (21y/o) have been dating for quite some time. I'm a senior in college, and he is also a senior but has chosen not to continue with his degree (electrical engineering) at the moment as he wants to get some hands-on experience first.\n\nIn May, we took a big step in our relationship when I met his whole family and he met mine. Since then, we've been spending nearly everyday together and practically living together at his college apartment that is only about 15 minutes from me. However, now that he is taking a break from college, he temporarily moved back home to his parents' house (1.5 hours away from me) in the middle of June. For some more context, I live in the city and he lives 1.5 hours into the suburbs. Since he often ran errands in the city or worked catering gigs, he would often pick me up on his way back and I'd stay with him at his parents' house for a couple of days until he'd bring me back the next time he had an errand/catering gig. Since I typically work online, this hasn't been an issue with my schedule. Additionally, I do not have a car and aren't too secure with driving on a highway in general as I only recently got my permit, which makes it difficult for me to come to him. His parents' seem to be okay with me coming and have even suggested I stay at his house while he goes to work and spend time with his mom who does not work and his sister who works from home.\n\nI've been extremely happy building this great relationship with him and his family. Even though I'm rather shy and find it hard to open up at times, I've been getting more comfortable and attempting not to just hide out in his room or only stay by his side. While his mom consistently tells me I'm welcome to make myself any food in the kitchen, go in the pool, etc, I still feel as if this is me overstepping as a guest. My fear of over-stepping or making myself too comfortable plays a big role in the issue that has come up.\n\nRecently, he has started a different construction job with his cousin as he hasn't been able to find an engineering internship yet and is unsure when he will be accepted to one. He is happy with his job and loves it as the paycheck is rather later and a lot more than the internship would pay. I am extremely supportive of him pursuing his goals, and I know that this is what is best for him. However, I'm terrified of how this job will affect our relationship. He often works at construction sites 1+ hours away, meaning that he is leaving for work at 6-6:30am at the latest and working until 6pm (meaning he isn't back home until around 7pm). Due to his schedule, he is working/busy about 5 days a week from 6am-7pm daily. While he does have many opportunities to check in and text during the day due to the way their work flow is arranged, I feel as if I'm disrupting him and causing him to be distracted at work when he texts me.\n\nOverall, he's told me hundreds of times that this won't affect our relationship and he will be seeing me Friday nights to Sunday nights even if he is driving to get me and bring me to his parents' house or staying at the college apartment. I love him extremely and appreciate everything he does for me. However, I feel like our relationship will be putting an extra strain on him as he is extremely busy already. I don't want to lose him and breaking up or taking a break isn't even a thought on my mind or option. I'm just unsure how to handle this and what to do. Has anyone possibly been in a similar situation and have some insight?\n\nOne big option on the table is potentially taking the train to him. However, the trains to him run only every few hours and are often delayed. They require a transfer in a rather unsafe area, which puts taking the train at night as a last resort. However, with my train idea, I would be coming to him on Friday mornings/early afternoons so I am there when he comes home from work. However, I feel as if I may be overstepping and making myself too at home at his parents' home as it's relying on his parents to open the door or give me a key, which I believe to be WAY too overstepping as only a girlfriend in my boyfriend's parents home.\n\nI feel like my post sounds silly or like not even a problem or issue. I'm so sorry if this pisses anyone off or annoys anyone.

It's all euphoric and exciting.\n\nBut straight after the meeting, I start to feel tense and insecure inside. I ask myself: Was everything real? Does he really want me?

Met this girl on Instagram a while ago. Funny thing is, I met her ex–best friend first, but they were part of this friend group that was always fighting and toxic. At one point, it got serious. I took her side. Cut off the others, blocked them, got harassed, argued, all that just to stand by her.\n\nBut since the beginning, she always had a hard time giving me time. I let it slide. Thought maybe she’s just busy, or maybe I’m asking too much. We had amazing memories together, but also some really painful ones. I think we fought like four times total, maybe more that I can’t even remember. Every time, I’d be the one to apologize first, beg, take the blame, promise to change. And maybe I didn’t change fully, maybe my problems came back, but I tried. Every single time.\n\nThing is, whenever I brought up how I felt, especially when I felt ignored or distant, she’d always turn it into me “not trusting her.” Like no matter what I said, she’d twist it and say I was doubting her. And yeah, I was harsh during one of those fights I admit that. But I spent 7 straight days apologizing, sending messages, trying to explain. Wrote her kind texts, honest ones, even some desperate ones when it felt like she was just reading and not replying. She kept me on seen, turned off her seen and typing status too, and didn’t respond. Not even once. Just silence.\n\nShe was on a trip to India with her family, and yeah her parents are strict. I get that. But still, no message for 7 days straight? No “I'll talk later”? Then she came back just to get mad at me for sending emotional texts during that time. Like... what?\n\nI was sick too physically and mentally. Fever, anxiety, I was crashing. I just needed her to check in on me, something small. But she told me about some kids asking her to play Uno, like that’s what she chose to say. So I asked her gently, are you doing this willingly or unwillingly? As in, are you ignoring me on purpose or are you just stuck? And she blew up again. More fights, more pushing me away. No matter how polite I tried to be, she kept snapping. It just kept getting worse.\n\nEventually, I got myself unblocked by asking her sister. I just wanted to talk, figure things out. She said she needed more time. I waited. Again. But that silence started eating me alive. So yeah, I wrote some harsh things. Out of hurt. Out of feeling abandoned. I blocked her.\n\nShe never reached out again. Not once. She always says I ruined her “mental peace,” that I cause drama when I just want to fix things. She made me question myself so hard. Said things that seriously broke me. When she did have time to message me during her trip, she used it to stay mad, not to check in.\n\nI reacted badly to one of her stories after all that. She finally sent a long paragraph saying I always find the wrong meaning in her words. That it’s not her fault, it's just her reacting to my reactions. So now I’m just here. Sitting with all this. Still wanting her back. Still hoping, for some reason. Even though deep down I know she probably doesn’t deserve me. Why do I still want her? Is this love? Or am I just trauma bonded to someone who was never really there for me in the first place? I know this is messy. I know I wasn’t perfect either.

I was in a relationship with this guy for more than a year. \n\nI recently went on a trip back home to see my family. \n\nBefore I went on this trip, a few days prior. One day he got in my face and started yelling at me uncontrollably, he was so loud and I was so scared. I begged him stop, eventually I placed my hand on his face gently and begged him to calm down. I have long nails and he moved fast. He then tossed his shirt across the room. Pushed me forcefully onto the bed and got on top of me and started making his hands to a fist trying to punch me. I started praying for my life, praying I wouldn't die that night. He then starts having a seizure and falls off the bed. At this point, I was shaking uncontrollably and crying but I didn't want him to die.  I then tried to turn him so he wouldn't choke on his spit. His seizure eventually stopped but when he managed to get up, he didn't remember anything. He said he only remembered yelling. He cried when I told what he did. That night I didn't feel comfortable sleeping in the same bed as him, so he slept outside. \n\nThe next day, I told him that he needed to get help. I told him to be honest with his parents and maybe they can support you in getting help. I told him I couldn't see myself feeling safe in the relationship unless he gets help. He told me he promises he will get help. He then called his mom infront of me and she was so upset. She told him never to lay hands on another man's daughter. The next few days after that last incident happened, I was shaking a lot. I had random palpitations throughout the day, i got startled by loud sounds and I had dreams of him killing me.\n\nThen I went on my trip to see my family and he knows my family is abusive. While on my trip. One day he went out with a couple friends. His phone broke and he disappeared for two days, he then texts me from his friends phone and says he wants to talk about something. I told him I was busy, but he said he couldn't wait and then he sends me a breakup text. He says he doesn't think we can be in a relationship anymore, he needs to work on his self, he doesn't want to keep hurting people around him and that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with anyone at the moment. He has to many problems in his head that he needs to work on. \n\nA few days later, I returned from my travel to find out he got into another relationship. And I had to see them out together, he didn't get help and just jumped into the next relationship. \n\nHis friend then tells me \"Maybe u pushed him to abuse you\", \"they are so in love, it was love at first sight\", \"he is serious about this girl\", \"he has every right to be in a new relationship, its not cheating anyway\". I was shocked. And apparently his family is forcing him to return back home to be closer to them so he can get help. And he did mention that in the breakup text that his family is forcing him back home. His friend said \"maybe that's why he broke up with you, its because of you that he is going back home\"\n\nI'm just so hurt and confused. How can you be in a relationship with someone for more than 1 year and after physically abusing them, you breakup with them abruptly (not even face to face) and suddenly you are in love?

I’ve planned and paid for almost everything for her trip.\n\nBut last weekend something happened that’s left me really shaken. She told me she was going to sleep early, but the next day she admitted (only after I confronted her multiple times!!!) that she had actually gone out partying with friends, including some guys and used party drugs. At first she denied it, got angry when I asked, and then slowly admitted the truth. Even now, some things don’t add up (like her timeline of when she got home vs. when she finally answered me).\n\nShe swears she didn’t cheat, and she’s asking me to give her a last chance. But I can’t shake the feeling that she’s still hiding things. I feel hurt, betrayed, and stuck between not wanting to throw away a year together and also not knowing if I can trust her anymore.\n\nSo here’s my question...  \n  \nShould I still go through with this trip and meet her, or should I cancel and walk away from hard-built 1 year LDRS?\n\nNote - We were okay with our LDR until this point.

(22F/30M)\n\nI (22F, America) am in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (30M, Norway). Just to address the age gap upfront: we’ve had many open, honest conversations about it, and both of us (as well as my family and friends) are comfortable with the difference. This also isn’t my first long-distance relationship, so I knew what I was signing up for.\n\nI love my boyfriend with all my heart. We recently had our first in-person visit where I stayed with him in Norway for 9 days. While we spent time sightseeing and enjoying being together, we also treated it as a trial run of living under the same roof. By the end, we had a long conversation confirming that we *could* see ourselves living together in the future. Our long-term goal is for me to eventually move in with him once our finances are stable.\n\nWe already talk and hang out online nearly every day, so it’s not like we aren't close. But, ever since that visit, I’ve been feeling especially lovesick. I find myself constantly aching to be with him in person again, and endlessly think about my next trip. Sometimes the feelings get so overwhelming that I even have intrusive thoughts about just \"running away” on a 90-day visitor visa, even though I know that’s not realistic or healthy. (For anyone wondering why he doesn’t visit me here in America, I have a strong personal dislike for America, and I’d rather put in the time and money to see him in Norway instead.)\n\nI also want to clarify: my boyfriend truly loves and cares for me, even if he’s not as outwardly emotional about the distance. He’s neurodivergent and struggles with empathy, while I’m very sensitive and empathetic, so I feel the strain more intensely than he does. He shows his love in steady ways, and we’re both committed to the same future together.\n\nSo my question is: for anyone who’s been in this position, how do you cope with the constant longing and lovesickness without letting it spill into work and daily life? Do you have routines or rituals that help soften the ache between visits? And how do you balance being present in your own life while still nurturing the relationship? While I do have my own hobbies and other friends and am not strictly dependant on my boyfriend's presence to be happy, I feel the longing hit especially hard while I am at work.\n\nAny advice, tips, or even shared experiences would mean a lot.

Is this grounds for a breakup?\n\nI’ll try to provide as much context and information as possible without making this too long. Before getting into the situation, here’s some background: I recently went through some medical complications with my Copper IUD. While it didn’t cause any permanent issues, it was enough for me to decide to discontinue birth control. I have various chronic medical conditions, and I decided that adding the possibility of additional complications wasn’t worth it. Before I had it removed, I was open and honest with my boyfriend that I wouldn’t be getting a new IUD and that we would have to go back to condoms, which we used for over six months before I got the IUD. We’ve been together for almost five years, and while I thought we were on the same page, this has been an issue ever since.\n\nAnytime I try to have an open conversation about different ways we can both meet our needs and that I’m willing to try things and find solutions or compromises, the conversation never seems to resolve.\n\nThe last few events that have me questioning things are as follows: For the past month, whenever either of us initiates sex, we end up stopping because he doesn’t want to wear a condom. He constantly says he “can’t feel anything” or that “it doesn’t feel the same/right.” It’s to the point where it almost looks like he shuts down when he puts it on.

I cannot move away for 4+ years. We have already done two years of long distance in the past.\n\nMy boyfriend 22M and I 22F have been together for 3 years now. We did long distance (5 hours, same state) for two years while we were both doing our undergraduate degree at different universities. My undergraduate university is in the same city where we are from. I applied to various graduate schools in state (PhD programs), and I took my only offer, which is at the school he is currently still attending for undergrad (I am one year ahead). \n\nSo for one year, we are both students at the same school. He’s contemplating moving back home for better work opportunities. There are definitely more connections, probably higher pay, and his family is there (along with mine).\n\nHe’s also contemplating staying here to be closer to me. It’s a lower cost of living here, and he does have quite a few connections from living here the past four years. It would be feasible to get a job here, but it would probably be remote or lesser pay (he is an IT/business guy). However, he’s very conflicted because he knows it would most likely be best to go back home 5 hours away. He’s in severe emotional distress about it.\n\nWe are really enjoying the start of our year together, especially after being long distance for so long. It’s really hard to fathom for the both of us that he could be going away for 4+ years (until I finish my PhD). I told him that we both know what the best option for his career is (moving away), and to not think about me in this situation.\n\nHowever, I kind of wish I could tell him to consider me in the situation too. But I don’t know if that’s wrong or not. I know it’s his career, and ultimately that is really what’s most important. But it’s devastating to the b both of us to think about its impact on our relationship. We want to get engaged within 1-2 years and not waste time starting a family once I graduate. To me, everything will seem so thrown off if we have a four year gap in our plans. \n\nIs it okay to tell him that I also want to be considered in this decision? I mean, I have told him that of course it’ll make me very sad for him to go. But I have said nothing along the lines of I should be one of the main deciding factors. I know that if I was in his shoes, I most likely would stay with my partner. But I obviously can’t coerce him like that, nor do I want to.

I met this girl my age online and over time we became best friends. Even exchanged each others numbers, called, she introduced me to her mother etc. We were just really close, and she had no other friends since she couldnt attend school for a while because of her mental issues, which I wont go into, but I feel as if its import to mention.\n\nWe talked mainly over the summer, like everyday, i had a summertime job, and my day was basically: work and talk to her. And well she didnt do any work so she also chatted me any chance she could get. We talked about everything there was to talk about, we shared some really fucked up secrets about each other, and well we werent afraid to do it, because we trusted each other that much, we could just tell each other anything and we knew that we wont judge each other, or tell anyone else. I had friends IRL too, from my class, but i just prefered talking to her, it felt so much more sincere, so much deeper. I liked her a whole lot, and she was attached to me aswell.\n\nAs time went on, i began to grow feelings for her, i began crushing at her. We began giving a little \"too much\" care to each other. Something \"friends\" dont really do. It felt like a relationship, even tho it wasnt, we percieved each other as the closest of friends. But it felt like something more, the time we invested into each other, the care, the assurance, the \"love\".\n\nThen it hit me. I couldnt do this. I knew that if we went on, we would begin do develop bigger feelings for each other, and eventually it would grow into a long distance relationship. I knew that we arent ready for that, we are still very young, and well, im more of a physical person, i crave contact and touch and well just seeing the person in person. So i knew it wouldnt work. She moves alot because of her mothers job, she even lived in my country for a while, when she was little tho. So i started being desperate, i thought maybe she can move here again, maybe her mother can get a position here again. But no, she could only get a position elsewhere, my country was not on the list. So i knew we couldnt be with each other. There was no way. \n\nI was now stuck beetwen a rock and a hard place, i knew that if we continued talking it would hurt us both because it would be wrong to do a long distance relationship given our age and circumstances, but also I couldnt just stay friends because weve already come so far. I couldnt be friends with someone that i dont see as a friend, but as a crush.\n\nSo i decided to leave her. I left her all alone and she was in a lot of pain. She tried to convince me so much to keep talking to her. I didnt want to do it and i cried alot aswell. But I told her that despite it all we cant continue talking. It felt right but it felt wrong. No, honestly, everything felt wrong at the moment.\n\nFast forward a couple of months. I still think about her daily. And each day i grow a bigger urge to text her again. But i feel like i dont have the right to. I hurt a person who was already struggling with trauma and issues. I played with her feelings in a way. And i just think if i go back i will reopen wounds and potentially hurt her again. But i dont know, honestly at this moment she is all i want. I just want to speak to her again. Theres really no one like her. Ive dated girls in real life and all of that, its all so bland and just insufferable. If you knew her you would know how special she is. She was the sweetest, i still dream about her from night to night. I want to text her so badly but i know in my head that it probably isnt the right idea but i just want to do it so much. Im the desperate one now and i dont know what to do. I honeslty hate myself for even getting into this situation. I dont even really enjoy anything in my life. Im a good student, hard worker, i do what im supposed to do and more. But i just find it all so boring and bland, school and people in general. I have no real passion or drive.

He made it seem like he did, then a week later said, “come to find out princess, it never booked, I thought it did.” I just brushed it off.\n\nOn top of that, my grandma passed this month (after other family losses too), so I’ve been really struggling emotionally.

For the first 10 months we were in the same city and got used to all the little day to day things together like late night hangouts, dinners, and just being able to see each other whenever we wanted.\n\nNow things are different. He recently moved to a university states away and we are officially long distance. We have only been doing this for a short time and so far it feels manageable, but there are definitely moments where the distance hits harder. The FaceTime calls are nice but they do not fully replace being there in person.\n\nWe do have a plan which helps. In about 7 months, when my university ends, I will be moving to live with him so we can start our lives together in the same place. That gives us something to look forward to and keeps me motivated, but right now we are still in the early adjustment phase. We downloaded Teleparty so we can keep up our movie nights and that has been a really nice way to feel connected.\n\nI would love to hear advice from others who have been in the same spot. What helped you stay close in the early months of long distance. Any creative date night ideas besides movies. How do you balance missing them with staying focused on the future.\n\nI would also love to keep you all updated throughout our journey as we figure this out together.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) are about to celebrate 1 year together.

Well I booked my flight to visit but my parents aren’t allowing me to go and had me cancel my flight. I am 20 and he is 19. They talked me about it and said the only way I could meet him was if they went, but idk like I think it’d be strange. This happened last week and they haven’t brought it up and honestly I haven’t brought it up because I’m having second thoughts. They said some really truthful things about the dangers and problems that long distance has. I know my partner would never hurt me or put me in a position that will hurt me. But they did bring up some good points and it got me thinking. I’m really unsure if our relationship could work. He also doesn’t want to work, he wants the the woman to provide. Although old school, I’ve always thought differently. I’m not saying he should fully take care of me, because I do want to have my own income, but I don’t want the income to only come from me. I’m a future med school and it will be so stressful. I won’t be able to be with him or talk much and it’s honestly making me have a hard time.

We have been through a lot together and as you can guess from our ages we have grown and changed a lot as well.\n\nFor the past year I have had this gnawing thought in my head that I am in the wrong relationship with the wrong partner and maybe there are 2 people out there that are better for the both of us. I have OCD so I largely have attributed my anxieties and obsessions about our relationship to this.\n\nWe mostly don't have any glaring issues. We laugh together with our little inside jokes and we are living in a relatively small apartment together with little to no fighting. We equally contribute to the cooking, cleaning (we are both OCD lol), and general upkeep of our home. We share many of the same political and religious views and generally hold the same values. She is very understanding and compassionate, especially towards my mental illness problems. We trust each other whole heartedly. She gives me the ocassional thoughtful gift and well-writen card for no other reason other than to say \"I love you\" (something I could get better at reciprocating myself).\n\nBut it isn't all perfect, our sex life has seriously taken a hit. We have sex maybe 2 times a month and she has openly said that sex isn't important to her and would be fine if we stopped. It feels like she only agrees to have sex because its been long enough and feels obligated which is such a gross feeling.\n\nIt feels like our conversations lack any real depth. Part of this is not having the time to bond like we used to as we are so busy with school and work. But, (and I know I am about to sound like the most conceited person in the world here) there feels like an intelligence gap between us. I am interested in discussing politics with others in a constructive way that deepens my understanding of certain topics. I like to spend my free time learning a second language, or creating a new software application (I do this for a living), or reading for the sake of learning about something. Considering this, it feels like after 6 years our conversations have become increasingly dull. But maybe I should expect this after such a long time.\n\nWe don't share many hobbies. I like to run, go to the gym, play video games, read non-fiction, party with friends, learn/study new things, woodwork, work with electronics. She doesn't relate to any of these things. We can't even find a movie or show we both like 90% of the time.\n\nShe doesn't have much interest in these things and the deeper issue is that she doesn't have a real interest in anything. She just likes to play on her phone all day or watch reality TV which feels like such a huge disconnect from my pursuits in life. I want to always try to be a better, more fit, more knowledgeable, kinder person tomorrow than today. But she doesn't have a drive to do anything. She is even telling me that she wants to drop out of her masters program and just work at the local grocery store, which is selling herself so short.\n\nI feel so guilty writing these past few paragraphs because it feels like I am complaining to the internet about someone I love so much. It comes off a some bitter old man who hates his nagging wife. She deserves so much better than that.\n\nWanting to break up feels like the most non-sensical thing. Because why do I want to break up with someone when there isn't some massive fight or glaringly large issue. It just feels like I am no longer happy. But then again, maybe I am just unhappy myself, separate of our relationship.\n\nOne big thing that has stuck in my head is that I am potentially falling into the fallacy of the grass being green on the other side. Maybe it is expected for your sex life to fall off after 6 years, or to not share many interests, or not be with someone as goal driven or hyper focused on self betterment. I feel like I have such an ego for expecting so much. This is my first relationship and I sorely like a frame of reference.\n\n  \nTL;DR - I feel like my gf and I lack common interests, have grown apart, and have a failing sex life.

If you remember a post with a girl from the US kissing the guy’s (from Portugal) cheek, this is me again and I desperately need your help.\n\nThings had been going so well. We’ve been planning a trip to get me to him in October to November. It’s stressful and a lot to figure out quickly. I also had a stressful thing in my life and kinda nitpicked at him a lot this week, things were tense. However, he still was affectionate and eager to call and talk to me. He then worked 13 hour shifts 4 days in a row. His best friend’s dad died. He started really feeling stressed about figuring out part of my visit. Within the past three days, he has gone from affectionate and loving to shut down. I felt it, and asked yesterday, and he said he was starting to feel really stressed about the details of the trip. And the future, he can’t be the reason I leave everything because what if it doesn’t work out.\n\nWe called last night (we are both under the influence during this call… so it’s a bit all over the place). Started by discussing the trip, he’s talking like he still wants me to come. We laugh and have a good little time. Then I ask why he has seemed off lately. Less flirty. He says “I don’t know, it’s just not really flowing”. I ask if it’s because he’s tired and stressed, or if he’s feeling differently. He says he doesn’t know. I push and ask if he hasn’t said he loves me because he isn’t feeling it. He says he isn’t sure how he’s feeling. He feels like he’s lost some feelings but has no idea why. He does want to lose feelings and doesn’t want to see other people. I ask if he’s excited to talk to me, he says sometimes, sometimes he does it because he knows I like it. \n\nI get upset, kinda push to see if he’s got any fight for me in him, and get hurt when he can’t say he definitely wants this. What he DID say is that he definitely wants to see me and be with me again. But he feels like a real future is impossible because of the distance.\n\nI asked him to think about our favorite moments from my visit. I named a few, and he smiled from ear to ear. I asked if he loves me in those moments, and he said yes absolutely. He’s never felt that way with anyone and wants that. I said that that is how he feels about me then, that the other stuff is noise and stress from the distance. That how he feels about me and how he feels about the situation are two different things, and reminded him that the distance is temporary. He asked how it could be temporary. I told him we would cross that bridge when we came to it, but that it isn’t impossible and to focus on what we want NOW. To see each other again.\n\nHe asked to go to bed, I said I was scared this would be our last call, and he said it absolutely wasn’t. \n\nToday, he’s been very distant. It hurts so badly to have him not sure how he feels, when three days ago he was so into it. Nothing happened with us specifically, so all I can think is that he’s overtired and overwhelmed and overthinking, and shutting down. That maybe he’ll come around. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I want to push to get the trip figured out (this is our only chance for a trip for about six months, but we have about five days to figure it out before I lose my prices and reservations), because I genuinely think it is what is needed right now. I want to call him and reminisce together on our favorite times and things about the other person. But I also want to not push him and give him the space he needs to not be overwhelmed if that’s what is causing this. \n\nI do not want to break up, so please don’t comment that. I want to see him in person again, like he said he wants too, but don’t know how to go about this. This morning I asked if we could just get it figured out so we can let go of that stress and he didn’t respond to that. Please let me know if you have any insight or experiences in similar situations!\n\nTLDR: boyfriend extremely stressed, overtired, overwhelmed. He’s not sure if he’s in love with me right now? Im not sure if he’s feeling this way bc of the distance or other stressful things in his life, because I know it’s not me. Feels a real future is impossible. Just wants to see me in person again. Planning trip, but on a time crunch, which is adding to his stress, but only way to see each other again and bring the life back into this. Not sure what to do. Don’t want to break up.

We met on Reddit and quickly became fast friends and then moved to WhatsApp and continued our relationship on there. We messaged a lot and called as well and sent audios. It was a beautiful relationship. \nHowever, he (25M) said some things that began to bother me a bit. Not major things, just slight things that annoyed me. My gut reaction was to get a bit angry but overall, I kept my cool and just told him I was annoyed. Our communication was actually really good otherwise and we figured things out together. \nA few months ago, I started telling people about this relationship. Now, just so I can add this here, most of my friends are Christian and tell me to date someone who has the same faith. My ex boyfriend (25 M) is not Christian. These friends told me to break up with him. They also said there were red flags in the relationship that I was dismissing. However, I could not see any of the red flags clearly. \nA month ago, I told a friend, who was not religious, about the relationship to perhaps find some comfort. She told me immediately to cut off all contact with him after reading his texts to me. I enjoyed how he talked to me (our relationship was also sexual and I enjoyed being degraded), but it was apparent that to others, it could have ended dangerously.  \nI decided to send him a text and then block him, as per my therapist and friend’s advice. I wanted things to end with a peaceful note, not with any anger or harsh feelings. This happened 10 days ago.

I 20f was with my ex 21m for 4 years. We had our future planned out together, we would get engaged when he was back from deployment, I would get my bachelors degree in nursing.\n\nHowever, things changed towards the end of our relationship which I would say was March of 2025. We were constantly arguing, he was becoming increasingly possessive to the point where it was making me greatly doubt me staying. He was deployed throughout all of this and I understand he was stressed, which is why I gave him the option that we separate for a little bit just to give each other that space and so we can work on ourselves. He had agreed, yet kept overstepping my boundary and when I told him not to do that, he would start getting angry with me.\n\nI eventually had enough and decided to end it with him in mid May.

I had one last conversation with my ex August 8th where we exchanged gifts and said our goodbyes. I thought I was okay, I knew I would have a love for him always, but I wasn’t in love.\n\nHowever, as of recently I’ve been mourning our relationship, what we used to have. It’s getting really bad and I feel terrible for my current boyfriend who has no idea what I am thinking. What makes it worse is that my boyfriend is long distance and I just don’t know what to say. He is very closed off emotionally, he likes to move past things rather than talk them out and I wish he would just speak to me.\n\nHe treats me so well, he has purchased gifts for me (I try to deny them) and I know he loves me and I know I love him. I just don’t know how to talk to him about this because I did tell him in the beginning of us dating that I wasn’t completely over the 4 years and he said that he’d be here every step of the way.

We were very close friends before we started dating. It's been about a year that both of us started working. I am very passionate and outgoing, so initially, when I moved to the new city for work, I would often go out and participate in various activities (something I enjoy doing). They were an introvert and used to stay back. I was not very good at sending regular texts, so even after trying, I failed at keeping them updated about my day. I genuinely felt sorry, but that was in my nature; I would push myself and put mental reminders to text them or send across photos.

Apologies for the long read.We met on reddit (don't do it) about nine months ago. We live several states apart. Started off as breakup buddies, nothing serious, and both stopped talking for about a month (she dated someone else in the meantime lol). I came back healed, with a realization that I had an interest in her. We hesitantly started being involved romantically. She was upfront about still being unhealed from her long previous relationship, but still wanted to continue if I did. She was also upfront about being in a situation where she banged one of her male friends after her breakup and received fallout for it during her short dating cycle. I really didn't care about this at the time, and still really don't (more to come)\n\nShe's very into astrology, and kept making jokes that Pluto has these \"transits\" that claim she'll have a brief romance up until September of this year, then some short flings and finally a long term relationship or something. She seemed deathly serious about this so I was a little bit peeved like okay is that your intention here, to fulfill your prophecy? You know you control your life?\n\nWe moved on, continued to date, she flew out to see me twice and had good times but we also both had very poor communication at times. If something bothered me, I would compartmentalize and work through it myself. On the second trip, about six months of knowing each other, I told her I loved her. She didn't recriprocate and this made things awkward. She left and I realized that it wasn't necessary for her to share those feelings verbally, as she was showing them with actions. We were good.\n\nDuring this entire time period, she was not easy to date. I still love her dearly, and she has a lot of lovely traits, gave me attention, and was trustworthy, but she constantly brought up her ex, didn't accept compliments well, and shut down most long term discussion regularly. She would regularly overreact to small situations and get upset for days. She was aware of this and on multiple occasions attempted to end things because she was \"undeserving and I deserved more.\" She wanted to be alone to heal (lol). She's also had issues with her pets that caused a lot of turmoil from them getting and sick and even her cat dying.\n\nMoving on to this month, so she's still friends with her friend that she casually banged because he was \"doing her a solid\" by initiating an offer to have sex with her when she had gone without it for so long, and it didn't have to mean anything. I told her this guy was obviously lurking in the shadows waiting for this opportunity and she went ballistic. She also has another ex from several years prior who moved to her city in the last few months and she was trying to befriend him because he had no friends (sincerely innocent on her part), and then she went to another exes wedding this month (and was in the wedding party), and apparently they're best friends now. She was upfront about about all of this, and I genuinely did trust her but I told her all of this compounding was making me uncomfortable. I told her this was not a normal situation and that I accept her friendships, but I'm never going to rejoice at the fact. I'm never going to celebrate these relationships, and wasn't even asking for anything, I just wanted to share how I was feeling. She lost it and this was the last straw. She was once again being \"slut shamed\" and I was dishonest, etc. She shared that she was an awful partner and couldn't respond like a normal person would to situations like this and wanted to breakup to be alone. Again, I deserved better.\n\nI also really believe she's playing into that September stuff which could indicate some type of very real psychological discrepancies. Don't get me wrong, I love diagnosing my Pisces traits and matching my personality, but to let a planet control my love life is too much.\n\nIt's difficult because she cares, and is just not ready for this. She's really a great human being who's been dealt some very shitty hands. I don't think she truly realizes what she's lost and she may never. I was not perfect, and lacked communication at times, but I feel like I was not wrong at the end, and will remain course. I'm not in the business of chasing someone who doesn't want me. I guess maybe I'm just asking for some solace? Please help.\n\nTldr: long distance girlfriend broke up because I was uncomfortable with her being friends with multiple exes.

Uncle died years prior to us meeting from aortic rupture, then his dad died 1 year into our relationship due to the same cause. My bf had to financially take care of everything, dad’s mortgage, his loans, his debts, his funeral etc. because he is an only child which pushed us into legit debt we’re still paying off. Which means we live day to day (did live us a heavy mortgaged house atleast that). My bf then had to start taking care of his grandmother who lives alone but due to age can’t go to the store, doctors.. \n\nThe aunt used to live with the grandmother and did some work for us so we could stabilise our income and pay off debts (work overtime and what not). Last week the aunt suffered a heart stroke, barely survived. \n\nNow it’s all on us. The aunt lives alone, had no man and bore no children, then there is the grandmother, which needs constant daily support and attention. The aunt lost mobility and is mentally 5 years old as she suffered brain damage due to lack of oxygen. We have barely enough money to cover our expenses and pay off debts, now the grandmother and aunt will need 24 hour help. We can’t afford it, the state won’t help, neither will social services.\n\nWe are young, we didn’t even manage to have a kid yet because we need to give our lives away for the people who’ve already lived their lives through, nor do we have financial needs to have a child. Our whole relationship is nonexistent because we work our asses off just to give the money to the people we aren’t even in debt with because of inheritance. We can’t take it anymore. \n\nWe can’t live like this anymore, my bf is a mess, i am a mess, we can’t go on like this. No amount of support from eachother, sticking together, love and respect can save us from what we’re experiencing. My bf became heavily suicidal, and I am depressed like i’ve never been before. These people who are legit not even our worry, have become the vampires robbing us of our lives and our future together. They’re robbing us of having kids and we can’t do anything about it, because they’re still family. \n\nWhat should I do? How can I (and him) escape from this hell that’s become our lives? I need advice, I am at my end. I sure as hell won’t leave my boyfriend because of his extended family I just want to live my life with him. I want our life, i want us, and noone else. \n\nShould we move to another country? Because that’s the best solution we have so far.

She confessed pretty quickly, and honestly, I didn’t take the relationship very seriously at first. Me and her wasn’t very mature back then, and she was also really obsessed with me. I couldn’t handle how demanding she was, and I wasn’t mature myself either, so after I moved to the U.S., I broke up with her.\n\nThat breakup really crushed her. She was depressed for months. During that time, she started dating one of our mutual friends, then later hooked up with another mutual friend, and even went to clubs looking for one-night stands.\n\nWhen I came home for the summer, she told me she still had feelings for me. This time, I realized she’d matured, and I could actually see her as someone who might be my lifelong partner.

How do I quiet these intrusive thoughts and move on so I can be fully happy with her?\n\nIf more details are needed, I would like to provide it.

He was super handsome, super funny and I thought super genuine. He would pay for dates and was super kind. We were seeing each other for a little over 2 months. He told me he was looking for a serious relationship, I said I was too. However, we never had the “what are we talk”. I liked the pace we were going. Seeing each other once or twice a week. Calling and Texting. I thought it really had potential. Honestly, I had not felt like this about a guy in a LONG time. \n\nOne night, we had a really good date. He kissed me goodbye. He said he would be busy the next day because he was hanging out with some friends. He texted me he got home safe. The next morning, I texted him good morning and to have fun with his friends. I never got a response. Completely ghosted. I never texted twice because after a day, I knew it wasn’t an accident. He didn’t think to text me all day. I was crushed truly. Heartbroken. It seemed like everything was going good then boom, it all went down the drain. I was very upset for about a week and then slowly got over it. This happened about 2 months ago now. \n\nFast forward to a week ago. I’m happy and putting myself out there. I’m at a bar and I see him. He is with a girl. I walk up to the bar. I’m ordering a drink and I hear his voice. He is close enough I can hear him but I don’t think he noticed me. I heard him tell some guy he knew that the girl was his girlfriend. It was like the healed wound ripped open. I left the bar immediately before he could see me. I tried not to let it bother me. \n\n2 days ago, my friend texted me that her friend is best friends with this guys girlfriend (if that makes since). They all went out for drinks I guess. She found out that this girl and my ex met the day after our last date. The day he ghosted me. When he was supposed to be with his friends. I guess they met, haven’t stopped talking since and have officially been dating for a month. Which means it took him a month to ask her to be his girlfriend. Which he was apparently not ready for with me as we hadn’t even had a talk about it we were seeing other people the two months we were together.\n\nNow this, has crushed me. He ghosted me because he met this girl. She got what I thought was mine. I don’t blame her, I’m sure she doesn’t know but I don’t understand why he couldn’t have just texted me “Hey I’m sorry, I’m not interested anymore”. It would have hurt but less that sitting wondering what I did wrong and why he didn’t respect me enough to give me closure. I just can’t help looking at her photos and wondering what she has that made him forget about me so fast. My friend told me she said they day they met, it was unexpected. They were both at this hangout I guess and they spent the whole day and night together. We never once had a sleepover. I was not able to sleep waiting for a text back while he was sleeping soundly with this girl. How he could he go from me to her so fast? What about her made him completely forget about me? After we had seen each other the day before? Being the girl before the girlfriend SUCKS.

He usually hangs out with other guy friends also in his city, but he has been hanging out with his mentor (23F) more frequently. He is not as close with other male interns because his project team (about 4 interns) is all women, and he says the guy interns usually go out to the bar, but he doesn't drink.

I was freaked out but ultimately I realized it would be controlling of me to tell him to stop hanging out with his friends.

To give a summary, nothing is on her, she did everything she could and tried every way to accommodate me but I continued to grow neglectful and distant. No matter how many times I said I would change, I'd fix it for a while and then end up forgetting or returning to taking her for granted. \n\nSo, with her coming to me to tell me that we couldn't work, we had long talks about what the issues were and- after a night- I logically realized that it was my fault at every turn. I know now what I need to do to change and be better and in the last two days I have proven to myself that I in fact am capable of the change. Understandably however, it's too little too late.\n\nOf course, I know it is unfair and illogical to ask her to stay, but I still do while still knowing that she can't do that to herself. A part of me still cannot think beyond this relationship and still can't come to terms that I let it fall apart, that I broke every promise I made to her, and that I've ruined a family for my child. \n\nHow can I deal with this?

Some could be the blame of my Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, aka my energy, constant exhaustion blah blah- I have a CPAP on the way to help with that.\n\nTL;DR I, neglectful partner, caused my partner and mother of our child to leave our 2 year relationship.

I'm losing my patience. \nMy wife and I have been married and living together for a little over a year now. Our Mutual friend, let's call her Jane, is really my wife's friend that gradually became mine due to the closeness of my wife and hers relationship. They have been friends a little over 4 years now, and they've had a lot of falling outs during that time, but always came back together. Jane had recently gone through a very difficult time due to an ex breaking things off suddenly, Jane not being on the lease and that ex effectively kicking her out. She had no where else to go. My wife and I opened our home to her. I didn't mind that she was in clear need of comfort the first night and ended up sleeping in our bed. She was exhausted both emotionally and physically. We all slept in the bed that night with my wife sandwiched in the middle. We talked and made sure everyone was comfortable with that, and that was fine. I was under the assumption that Jane would know that wasn't going to be every night, especially not knowing how long she's staying. I still would like alone time with my wife, for certain reasons I'm sure most would understand but another reason of just plain simple quality time. I work nights, so often times my wife and I will watch movies or play video games late at night when I get home, and we cuddle and maybe we move on to some extra curricular activities. It's not always a guarantee and it's not always the point. Sometimes a good makeout session is good enough. But my wife doesn't really like doing any of the more intimate things, (especially the main event) with Jane in our bed. And I'm also really uncomfortable with that for obvious reasons. After a couple weeks I was getting irritated, so I got the living room set up for her to sleep in there. We had a conversation, she said she understood and that was that. She slept in there for one night and then found somewhere else to be. Then that didn't pan out for whatever reason, and she came back. I maintained the boundary of her sleeping in the living room which went fine. I thought we all understood and everything was kosher. Well, Jane had left for a few nights again, and then came over this morning and had asked to stay til Wednesday (? Maybe Thursday. Not sure.) And we said that would be fine. Except now, I'm working tonight, and Jane had asked if we set up the living room to my wife, which we had not. Jane then said \"oh its fine I can sleep in the bedroom\". Which my wife had misinterpreted and said that's fine. For context, we have 2 bedrooms, the 2nd bedroom is for our kids. Jane also has 2 kids who have been with her. My wife thought Jane meant in the room with the kids, which is fine. But then Jane went to OUR bedroom and set up her kids playpen in there for the night. My wife didn't want to fight her or make a big deal out of it, and is begging me to just leave it, but I am not comfortable with this. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how was the situation handled? I don't want to blow up their friendship or burn any bridges, but I want to sleep in my bed comfortably, and I really don't want to have to keep dealing with this every time she stays over, regardless of the reasoning. \n\n\n(Edit: Context): My wife is bi. There was a time where Jane and her were interested in each other, and I gave them a window for extracurricular activities between the 2 of them. They didn't do anything aside from flirting and simple kisses. It became clear that Jane didn't have the ability to initiate and my wife is not one to initiate either. Honestly it was painful to watch them attempt things. For multiple reasons. I thought maybe it would be hot or something but realized I'm very territorial over my partners and I didn't like the way it made me feel. And on the other end, neither of them actually acted on it, so it felt rather pointless after 2 or 3 months.\nAnyway, we all had a long conversation about the feelings and how I learned that wasn't something I was okay with and put new boundaries in place to prevent anyone from getting hurt. I apologized for putting them in an awkward situation as well because even tho it was an experiment, it's not like there weren't real feelings involved for them as well. I'm very positive my wife wouldn't cheat on me having been a victim of it herself in previous relationships.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Please tell me what to do.\n\nJust to provide a context: we have been together for 10 months, and even though it wasn't always like that, it was mostly really happy. My girlfriend is a really nice person, but is very prone to get hurt due to her insecurities. She gets vulnerable real soon with almost anyone showing her a hint of kindness or respect towards her, only to get hurt by many people taking advantage of her kindness. For example, there was this one time she had my phone and I left without it for home, and she then felt so guilty I had to come back from home to our university's hostel where she lives so I can collect it, that she wrote me a letter of apology, me being her boyfriend and I wasn't even slightly angry with her. But I didn't know what to make out from a letter of apology because I really never expect anyone to do that, let alone my girlfriend. She gets hurt from her one friend who gaslights her a lot, and her other friends who don't directly hurt her, usually are distanced from her for reasons unknown. And she is just utterly confused if it's because of her that people are moving away. \n\nNow, coming to now, so a guy, who is 2 years senior to her, apparently a nice guy texts her since she is part of this student society which the guy is a head of. He is nice to her, so she opens up a little and tells about the TV shows she watches and asks if he watches them. Then at some point she thought she is being annoying to the guy so she texts him \"Am I being stupid to talk to you like a friend? Can you be honest about how annoyed are you on a scale from 0 to 10\" and the guy without hesitation replies \"6 lol\" and she is immediately like \"sorry\". She has her university examinations going on at this time, and this just immediately made her call her mother and cry to her. I felt so bad hearing this. \n\nSo, now, after seeing her messages what she texted him, it seemed to me she was quickly attaching to someone, she asked me why does it happen to her, and I was initially trying to just coax her that the guy was just a dick. But then, she insisted I be honest with her and I told her message might come across as \"being desperate\" sometimes, and that was just the nail on the coffin. I tried to clarify with her that people treat her on the basis of how we project ourselves, but nothing could be done. I made a comment on her personality, and i shouldn't have done that, I know that. \n\nI hope anyone can suggest me how I can rectify this now, and in the future, because I really love her, and I really didn't mean to hurt her on purpose.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I've started to notice that when we talk, it's always about things my bf is interested in, or sometimes things we both like. When I try to share something I like, he just nods or hums along, until the theme switches to something else and then he gets more talkative. When he talks I ask questions, I give my POV (which is usually shut down), I remember, and I ask about the evolution of the situation later.\n\nSo when there is a conversation going, it's mostly about him venting about work, about what's troubling him, about his favorite shows (some of them we both like), about his projects, telling me he's hungry so that we figure out dinner...\n\nHe rarely remembers when I say something. For example: when we started doing it unprotected (we both are tested and clean, I'm using birth control), I told him I didn't like the feeling of it driping out afterwards and asked for something to clean myself. He brought it, and all was fine. But I keep asking for it all the time. One night, he got up after the deed, went to the bathroom... flushed, washed his hand, drunk some water, and came back for cuddles. I had to ask him again if I could have something to clean up without dripping everywhere on the way to the bathroom. (we always do it at his place, as I still live with my family)\n\nThe tipping point to me posting this on reddit was when he wanted me to spend the night at his place yesterday. I said no, as we always sleep late and I don't sleep well there, and that I have music reharshal (after work) the next day that I won't be able to do efficiently if I'm too tired. And I added that we can have a sleepover the next night or the night after that.\n\nHe send back a \"U_u\". And I thought: what I am supposed to answer to that?

Hi Reddit, m(25) living in Latam m(28) living in Japan. We started our relationship when he first came to Latam and I felt in love so much that we never stopped talking (January 2025). After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year. I love him so much and hurts me to think that I won’t be able to see him and kiss him ever again, but I feel that I don’t deserve that kind of love and I would give everything of me and even get in debt to spend time with him 💔.

I read through all your advice, and it really helped me clear my head. Like many of you suggested, I didn’t wait too long before bringing it up.\n\nWhen I confronted him, he broke down. He cried, admitted everything, and begged me for forgiveness and a last chance.

My immediate thought was to leave him, but I didn’t want to make such a big decision while I was overwhelmed and emotional. After journaling and taking time to process, I decided to give him one last chance. I know some of you may think that’s foolish, and maybe it is, but after 5 years together, with him never once treating me badly or giving me a reason to doubt him, it didn’t feel right to throw everything away in one moment.\n\nSince then, he’s deactivated his Twitter and voluntarily gave me access to all of his social media accounts. He even screen-shared everything with me, though I didn’t ask him to. I know these gestures can’t erase what he did, but right now, in our situation, all I can do is take his words and actions and see if he follows through.\n\nHe told me he isn’t just asking for another chance because he doesn’t want to lose me, but because he truly believes he can make things right again and rebuild my trust and confidence in us.\n\nFor those wondering why we haven’t met yet, that’s been my choice, and he’s always respected it. I have personal reasons, but they’re unrelated to this situation, but we are both consenting adult, me 23, him 26. I still believe he is a good person, otherwise I wouldn’t feel this deeply hurt and disappointed by him.

[23M / 23F]\n\nHey everyone, I’ve [23M] been reconnecting with my ex [23F] (we dated back in high school for about two years until we graduated at the end of 2020). We were “high school sweethearts” — lived in the same city, went to the same school. I’m more of an old-school romantic type: I love writing letters, dedicating songs, and I’m very affectionate/physical. She’s a bit colder and struggles to express feelings, but back then she showed me enough that I never doubted she loved me.\n\nFast forward to now, we’re not officially back together, but we’ve been really close again these past 2 months (saying what we feel of each other still after many years, even I’m considering planning a trip to her she lives currently at the end of this semester). Most nights we fall asleep on video calls, and I guess I got used to that routine because it feels really comforting.\n\nThe thing is, right now I’m studying in Mexico while she’s at university in the US. She likes going out with her roommate (her best friend), and she’s been socializing more. I know it’s normal and she deserves to enjoy her life, but I get anxious when she goes out and I don’t hear back from her.\n\nExample: yesterday she went clubbing, and I went to a bar near my place. On the way back, she actually tried to call me, but I was in the shower. About 30 minutes later I texted to see if she was home, but she didn’t reply anymore. Today she still hadn’t answered, and I caught myself checking her Instagram to see if she was active… which only made me spiral harder.\n\nI think my fear comes from two things:\n\t•\tI saw a close friend’s LDR fall apart because his girlfriend would go out on weekends and “disappear,” and it drove him crazy.\n\t•\tMy ex told me that after we broke up, she dated a few guys who were very clingy and suffocating, and she hated it. Ironically, that was my biggest fear when we were together — but recently she told me she never felt that way with me, and actually liked that I wasn’t like that.\n\nSo now I’m stuck. On one hand, I’d love if she could just send me a quick “I’m home” or “going to sleep” text when she can’t talk, just for peace of mind. On the other hand, I don’t want to come off as controlling or make her feel like she has to “report” to me.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this?

Personally, I’m the type of person who would want to see each other as much as we can and figure it out as we go, so his stance feels frustrating to me.\n\nOn top of that, there are other issues:\n\n* He’s very set on wanting kids someday, while I’m not sure if I do.\n* He’s transitioning, and while I love him, I’m honestly not sure how I feel about the physical changes or his new name — it feels weird for me sometimes.\n* He carries a lot of guilt about being closeted from his family which often puts strain on our relationship.\n* He also has a strong aversion to discomfort (like the idea of traveling “too often”), which can be hard for me to understand and honestly annoys me.\n\nWe’re both 21, and while the love and bond are strong, it just feels like the odds are stacked against us. I’m pessimistic by nature, but I can’t help but wonder… is there even a point in trying to make this work, or am I ignoring the red flags? People say your first love is rarely your last, and I'd love to work things out with him, but I'm thinking, being so young should we both cut our losses and become friends?

I followed up the next day and she hit me with \"I'd rather be friends if thats okay. I'm gonna take a break from dating\" which okay thats fine no ill will. I said I'd try to be friends but wanted some time  to sort myself out as I thought she was suoer cool and didnt want to be that guy who is crushing on a female friend.

She grew up in a broken household with absent parents while I grew up in the traditional nuclear family with parents who are in a healthy relationship. She is a 1st generation Asian American from a family that immigrated, while I am a white German American family.\n\nWe have been dating for just over four months now and we have come to learn we have very different political views, we did discuss this very early on in the relationship but did not do a deep dive. \n\nMy partner is very far left individual due to racism, sexism, and gender dysphoria faced throughout their life. She pretty much agrees with all far left ideologies, she states she hates all men, and considers all Trump supporters to be racist, sexist, and she believes in abortion rights (just to name a few topics). She did grow up in Christianity but had a rough experience that involved racism so she does not practice any form of religion.\n\nI have been raised catholic and conservative, so a lot of my political beliefs stem from the Bible and Christianity (union is between a man and woman, generally against abortions, don't agree with LGBT lifestyle). I am not a trump supporter, but I am indeed conservative with my views. I believe all people deserved to be loved regardless of how they look, I just have trouble agreeing with ideologies/lifestyle choices.\n\nOne night we had a pretty bad argument about all those political topics mentioned and we never found a common ground. She stated that she does not want to be with someone who is against her rights or who is not an ally of LGBT. I've told her that I treat all humans with love and respect, but it does not mean I HAVE to agree with their lifestyle choices. She was not the biggest fan of that and she asked me to do research on those respective groups to try to understand some of the issues they face. To which I have, but however it has only hardened my beliefs. She is aware that I am catholic and that I study the Bible, I have tried to have to read the Bible to see my point of view but she is very against it at times. To me, it feels like a \"my way or the highway\" situation, but I may be over thinking it. \n\nI very much enjoy her company and can see myself having a future with her.

I’ve also never really posted on Reddit before (minus asking a similar question that I immediately deleted), so I’m not sure the proper way to do this. \n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for four years. We’ve had plenty of ups and downs, but mostly our relationship is fine — in the sense that we generally don’t fight and we both genuinely love each other. \n\nHere’s the big thing though: he cheated three years ago. \n\nThe first year of our relationship was incredible. \n\nWe both met each other in pretty volatile times in our lives. I had been in a toxic relationship with a woman about four months before we met. My ex dumped me after repeated cheating (that I wasn’t aware of until after my relationship ended), lied about pretty intense drug use, was in constant communication with her ex, and overall just used any opportunity to make me feel horrible about myself. I was really at an all-time low … and then I met him. \n\nHe had ended a long-term relationship after finding out his ex he lived with had cheated on him. Before that relationship, he was married to a woman fresh out of high school who also cheated on him. \n\nWe met on a dating app, just planned to hook up one time, and ended up falling in love. I wanted to be around him all the time — he made me feel so good about myself, which was something I hadn’t felt in a long time. He was so supportive, and I truly felt how much he cared about me.\n\nWhen we met, he was going through a period of self-discovery, and he literally came out as trans (FTM) the day we met. I had previously identified as gay, but things with me and him just clicked. I was there through every step of the way at the beginning of his transition, from his first shot of testosterone, to legally changing his name and gender marker. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship, there was a drastic change. I felt him start to push me away. He didn’t want to see me as often, and I started to feel similarly to how I had in my previous relationship. He asked to take a break, which I respected. He wanted me to go to therapy, which I did. \n\nAfter having gone through what I had the year before, and thinking about how well he treated me for so long, I was desperate to keep him. I was there at his beck and call when he wanted me, and I stayed away when he didn’t. I was willing to do anything he wanted, even when he made me feel like an afterthought. \n\nWe had a very short-lived official breakup. For just a few weeks, he told me he had had enough and we didn’t see each other, but we still talked every day. During this time, I was interning at a big insurance firm in my city, which hosted events for the interns. One night I was getting ready for one of these events when he asked me to skip and get dinner with him instead, which I did. That night, he said he wanted to try things again, and I said that he couldn’t just toy around with me anymore, and from there on out, he didn’t. He was back to his caring, supportive self. \n\nBut I asked if he had slept with anyone else during this time, and he told me no. \n\nOne year later, we were on vacation with my grandparents, and after a night out, he got too drunk and was sick in the bathroom. While I was grabbing his phone for him, I saw a cute message from one of his friends. I opened his phone (we’ve always shared passwords, but I had never snooped because I didn’t think I had a reason to), and I saw that he had been gushing about me. Wanting to see what else he had said, I searched my name in his iMessage, and that’s when I saw a text that said, “I’ve never cheated before, if you can call what I did to [my name] cheating.” \n\nThen, I read through messages between him and a friend where he was talking in graphic detail about sleeping with someone else. The messages were from months after our break, but it made it clear that this situation had happened when we were on our short-term breakup. \n\nI was obviously devastated, but when I asked him about it, he was honest. He told me everything and he answered all my questions when I asked. I was heartbroken, but he was adamant that he didn’t cheat because we technically weren’t together at the time. I definitely felt like he HAD cheated, especially since I had asked if anything happened the night we got back together, and he lied. He also had all the time in the world to tell me about it in the year after it happened, but he never did. \n\nI stayed though, because at the time he needed me. He was having top surgery in a few weeks, which required pretty intensive caregiving, and he needed me to watch his dog. Over time, I grew to forgive him, but the feelings never went away. \n\nAfter that, I started to notice how often he put me in situations that I wasn’t entirely comfortable in. He wanted to move in together when I was still in an active lease with my college roommates. When I said I didn’t want to pay two rents, he told me he had “nowhere else to go” despite living with a friend who owned their home. He started distancing himself from my friends, stopped attending family events with me, and stopped caring about anniversaries and birthdays. \n\nI was upset by this, and after about a year of living together, I thought about ending our relationship and moving out on my own. He found these messages, and when confronted, I folded because I hated the idea of losing him. In that time, we signed another lease and moved into the place we’re at now, which brings me to today. \n\nMy thoughts about the cheating, living alone, and his distance haven’t gone away. He has been putting more of an effort into showing up for me, and our relationship has been genuinely good for the last year or so. However, my friends hate him and not so subtly encourage me to leave him. \n\nOur deadline to resign the lease is at the end of the month (our lease is not up for another 60 days, however), and I’ve been thinking about moving out yet again. I brought this up with him, which obviously wasn’t received well on his part, and we’ve been spending the last few days separate.\n\nHe wants to see a couples’ counselor, which we are doing tomorrow (at the time I’m writing this), and he’s told me how much he wants to make this relationship work, how hard this distance has been, and how he can’t imagine his life without me in it. \n\nThe distance is hard for me too, and honestly, I just want to make things work. But now, my family knows what’s been going on, and my friends are ready for me to move on, but I feel so torn.

He’s been dealing with toxic family and work dynamics. He’s admitted that he’s extremely depressed.\n\nI feel as though our dynamic has changed, and it confuses me about my place within his life. I feel like I get hot and cold messaging from him, especially regarding when we will reconnect again in person. It stresses me out because I feel like I’m in an emotional limbo. It goes from talking about what we will do in person to not knowing when we’d meet. Our communication over the phone has also changed, which adds onto the stress of trying to figure out the relationship.

To me, that could happen regardless of distance and it’s inevitable that outside forces become enmeshed in our daily interactions. I’m not excusing his actions, but he has dealt with a lot the past month outside of our relationship that did affect his mental health, which he admitted to me. However, I feel frustrated because I don’t understand who I am to him. I am his girlfriend, but I feel pushed away. I feel like he can be normal with his friends, and hang out and talk to them and have fun, but then comes to me, and takes out his frustration on me, while leaving me behind.\n\nFor now, I’ve stepped back from the relationship to protect myself and to give him space to figure out his feelings.

I struggle to defend my fiancée in certain situations, and it is tearing her to pieces. This post is probably going to be all over the place, so I apologize in advance.\n\nI am not good with conflict, especially when it involves those I love—specifically, my mother, father, and my fiancée. Whenever these situations arise, I cannot find the words to defend my fiancée when I know something being said is wrong. This leads her, understandably, to feel as though I do not care enough about her to defend her—that I’d rather side with my parents, or that I am not afraid to lose her.\n\nIn my head, I feel like I know all of the right things to say, but I just cannot find the ability to say them. I understand when a situation we are in is wrong, but I cannot bring myself to defend her. It's like I try to hide in my own body or mind, because I do not want to deal with what this comes with. I want to give some examples of what I mean.\n\n**The Cruise** — My father invited me and her on a family cruise they were planning. My fiancée and I thought it would be fun, and we talked about it back and forth. The next day, my father called and said it would be better to leave it as immediate family. I went along with it and gave zero pushback. When I told my fiancée what my dad had said, she was of course upset—because she had been invited, and then uninvited. I had no questions for my dad about where this came from, why she was uninvited, or why she was invited in the first place. My fiancée (girlfriend at the time) was upset because I did not defend her. I didn’t question my dad—I just went along with it.\n\n**The Bridal Shower** — My fiancée was speaking with me and my mom, and she mentioned that she wanted to do her bridal shower around six months before the wedding. Since we’re looking at getting married in May, if she did it the “traditional” two months before, it would fall during the Canadian winter, which wouldn’t be ideal. My mom pushed back and was adamant that six months was way too early and that it *had* to be two months before the wedding. My fiancée was understandably upset with me for not defending her, because ever since I proposed, we agreed we were going to do things our way. I didn’t step in or push back on my mom. Looking back, I should have said something like, “Why does it have to be two months out?” or “We already have a plan we envisioned, and we’re going to stick to it.”\n\nThere have been other times I haven’t stood up for us, always involving my parents. I’m not one for confrontation, and ever since I was young, I’ve done whatever my parents wanted. My fiancée, on the other hand, is used to standing up for herself in situations like these. She stands up for me with her family 100% of the time, and I admire that—but I just can’t bring myself to do the same.\n\nI love my fiancée. I know I need to stand up for her and her feelings. I just struggle to physically do it, and I’m scared I won’t change. I want to stand up for her. I want to support her no matter what, because she is my other half and she would do that for me any day. I just cannot find the way to actually do it.\n\nIt’s like I freeze up. I can recognize that “this situation is wrong,” and I can think of what to say, but by the time I figure it out, the moment has already passed and I can’t say it anymore. I don’t know how to change this. I don’t know how I can become more automatic with my responses, instead of overthinking to the point where I can’t speak, defend, or rebut.\n\nI struggle with upsetting those I love. I feel torn between upsetting my parents or defending my fiancée. I can’t find the ability to face my fears and stand up for us, no matter what the other opinion may be. It’s hard for me to go against the people who raised me.\n\nWe’ve been off for the past couple of days because of the bridal shower argument. I’ve been reflecting, and here’s where my head is at so far: I need to understand that everyone will always have an opinion, and if my opinion upsets someone—no matter who it is—it shouldn’t matter. I need to defend my fiancée when something is not right, especially when we’ve agreed to do things our way, but then as soon as someone challenges us, I just freeze. I need to get over my fear of conflict, because I think just *starting* the conversation would be enough for me to defend her—I just need to get there. I get anxious about starting fights, especially with my parents.\n\nI am looking for feedback—anything to help me get over my fear of disappointing people I care about, so I can defend my fiancée and myself.\n\n**TL;DR**: I have a hard time defending my fiancée against my parents. I freeze up and cannot find a way to initiate that part of the conversation until I’ve overthought it and the moment has already passed.\n\nI read a comment on another post, that read \"Think about why it is that other people's feelings matter more to you than your wife's.\" and this hit home for me. This sparked more and more thinking.  \n\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: just an update for anybody that is seeing this post later. This is the next morning. I’ve read through and responded to most comments as much as I could. I appreciate everybody’s input. I was not looking for Reddit to solve my problems. I was more looking for some guidance and a kick in the ass to get the help I need. I’ve always contemplated therapy, but I think it is what I need and some of the people commenting have introduced me to CBT therapy which I’ve never heard about so I appreciate that as well. \n\nThank you for all of the people that have given me good advice and also shared stories.

I used to visit her every 2–3 weeks for a few days (5 days aprox), but since early July, when she went back home for summer break, we haven’t seen each other.

I want to add that we have known each other for several years, since early teens, and decided to explore this relationship outside of friendship.\n\nIt has been going well for the most part. He’s outgoing, he’s loud, he’s fun and spontaneous.\n\nHis drinking has become more apparent with the more time I spend with him and I can tell that more times than not he’s been drinking and lies about it. He has gotten more aggressive when he drinks that family members of his have tried to talk to me about it.\n\nHe admitted to drinking and lying to me about it and had an excuse that he just feels like I am going to be upset if he’s honest about it. The issue is, while I am not opposed to his drinking… he is getting off of work and by the time he clocks out he is noticeably drunk. About 3-4 times a week. Slurring words, attitude, aggressive and will shortly later pass out.\n\nI don’t think drinking is his only problem. I allowed him to borrow my car for a day while his car was in the shop. He works construction so that weekend when we were together I drove it to the car wash and started cleaning it out. It had sand and dirt in it etc. He was with me and when I scooted the seat back… I found a pipe. I picked it up, he immediately snatched it out of my hand. I asked him what it was and he said it was nothing but a chillum and I am “tripping out for no reason” I said “I’m 31 years old and that was not a weed pipe” He threw it in the big dumpster so there was no evidence.\n\nLater that evening, I came to him as a friend and told him that I love him and if he is struggling with addiction that he can talk to me and I am a safe space for him. If he needs help I will do what I can to help him and I just want him to know it.\n\nHe became irate, yelled at me, told me it’s disrespectful that I even think he could be using.\n\nIs it time for me to leave? Have I extended my help far enough? Am I treading in dangerous water right now?\n\n*TL/DR*- boyfriend struggling with addiction, found suspicious things too", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I just missed how he was in the beginning, all loving, sweet, and kind to me, but he’s changed so much and I feel so bad\n\nHe’s the one who brought it up because he noticed a few of my reposts on tiktok being about how I want intimacy and how I feel like im being treated like dirt, he told me I was making myself out to be this helpless victim and that I was complaining about him. He said that he realized he didn’t need or want a relationship, that he was tired from how badly love has hurt him in the past that he didn’t want anything with me anymore yet I feel like I treated him so well the past year we’ve been together so why is he taking out this hatred of love on me?\n\nHe said I should probably find someone better than him while he thinks about when he wants a relationship again, and I said no. I said I’d wait. It just hurts because I was there for him and helped/supported him through so much, I supported him throughout him being suicidal, I supported him through his self harm, through his hallucinations and mental illness, and now he just turned around and told me he could handle things on his own, that he didn’t want me\n\nI asked if he loved me and he said “I don’t know what that is,”he told me cares about me but feels nothing for me. Yet he’s contradicting himself by texting me a few minutes after we ended the conversation and saying “I still have feelings for you.” I just feel horrible. I want him to want me and love me, I want the intimacy that he claims to be so tired of yet has no problem giving me once every month or so. I feel bad and feel like this is all my fault, I told him I’d wait for him because I don’t want to be with anyone else but I don’t want to wait at the same time, im heartbroken and I just want him to come back.\n\nWe’re “friends” in the meantime but I don’t want to be friends, I don’t think I can take trying to act so casual after all this.

I am British and she is Spanish. We met on a language learning exchange app. We talked a lot for a while, but due to distance we stopped . Occasionally, we start messaging again before it dries up again.\n\nI moved to Madrid two years ago, while she lived in Barcelona. As we didn´t talk much, I forgot to tell her whenever I went to Barcelona (twice) and so we never met in person. I have sinced moved back to the UK.\n\nFor the past month or even two months, we have been talking nearly every day. Our chats have become a lot more personal and sometimes even sexual (talking about fetishes, likes and dislikes, sex lives etc) \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was still living in the UK and she was visiting London for a concert. She invited me to come with her since she was alone and wanted to meet me. I was bored since I was waiting for my visa to return to Spain and was frustrated since I waited 8 weeks for it at the time  (it coincidentally arrived as soon as I came back from London.)\n\nShe had her own flat and only one bed, obviously we would be sleeping together. I have done this with both make and female friends before, she said that no sex was going to happen so I assumed it wouldn't go there.\n\nWhile in London, things were friendly. It was nice to be with her although I was extremely nervous. She kept holding my arms, hands and laid on me every time we sat down at a bench. We went to the park and she grabbed my hand and put it down her top to touch her breasts. I was surprised and couldn't quite believe it at first, but it was funny as she was laughing and I was embarrassed.\n\nWe had food and returned to her apartment. We sat and watched a movie before she suddenly turned the lights off and took her clothes off, we then had sex. I didn't quite prepare for any of this to happen. It sort of just happened without me even thinking or wanting it on text to being in this situation.\n\n\nI returned to Spain two weeks ago and we have spoken every day. I told her that I like talking to her and enjoyed London, but as I have no idea how long I'll be in Spain for and that I'm not ready for a relationship (especially one that is long distance). She took it badly at first and was upset. \n\nWe continued talking and she kept asking to come to Madrid where I live. I felt pressured to say yes, because she kept asking if I was interested in her and she wants to see me a lot. She booked tickets to visit and now will be staying with me. While I enjoy her company, I don't really want sex. Yes, it is fun and nice to be intimate and to spend time together, but without a clear thought on what exactly our relationship is and how it became how it is, I feel empty.\n\nShe keeps getting mad at me when I dont talk much or when I don't ask her things that she hasn't requested. She wants to get to know me more and seems controlling and clingy. Every time I stop talking as much, she blows up my phone and gets sad. \n\nI didn't think we had much chemistry and ever since London, she won't leave me alone. I got scared before my flight (4 days after London) since it felt like she was a girlfriend - constantly checking how I was, where I was and how my flight was. \n\nI want to be with her and still talk, but I'm unsure how to feel. I like being with her and told her how I feel, but feel guilty and slightly pressured into getting into a pseudo-relationship.\n\nHas anyone had a similar situation?\n\nIs this a normal thing?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

To simplify this crazy situation as much as possible, let's call him A. A is a very good friend of B, one of my childhood friends. They met through work. In 2022, B and I travelled to Turkey for work and I met A, who lives there for work.\n\nWe were both in relationships at the time, so nothing happened, but we got on really well. A and I kept in regular contact, we often texted each other, he came to see B and me when he was passing through Paris and I did the same when we were passing through Turkey. This year, the texts with A became more frequent and the content of our discussions more intense. We were both coming out of difficult breakups, and our already intense friendship took on a new dimension. We talked about a lot of personal things, and A confided in B that he was afraid of messing everything up because I ‘am not like other women’. At the same time, I learned that he had confided in B that he had had a crush on me since the first day we met three years ago.\n\nI went back to Turkey alone this summer for work again and saw A several times. We ended up sleeping together and it was particularly good, according to both of us. The next day, we couldn't let go of each other, we walked around Istanbul all day, but I had an early flight back the day after.\n\nSince then, our exchanges have been heated. I know from B that he has the same expectations in a relationship as I do: something serious, stable, etc. As I've known him for three years, I know he's a gentle, kind, consistent bloke, so he ticks quite a few boxes. He sends me lovely things every day and tells me we need to see each other again as soon as possible. I'm due to go back to Turkey in November on business, so that works out well. In his messages, he is passionate. I can feel the intensity of our friendly exchanges AND a desire/love that has clearly been largely repressed for two years, so it's quite touching.\n\nI have to come to terms with two things: on the one hand, the fact that our friendship is turning into a romantic relationship, which is nice in itself. On the other hand, my pragmatic side is taking over: how do we deal with the distance?\n\nWe have the financial means to see each other, but that doesn't erase the distance. I want to give this relationship a chance because it seems obvious to both of us, and it's the first time this has happened to me, but anyway. He is a Franco-German journalist currently assigned to the Istanbul desk. He used to live in Hamburg but gave up his flat there. I'm an engineer based in Paris, and I've thought about looking for work in Istanbul because I'm at a stage where I need a temporary change, so why not spend a year or two abroad? BUT it's not a decision to be taken lightly.\n\nWhat do you think? How should I proceed?\n\nI don't want to pressure him, it's only been 10 days (yes, really), but as I'm already thinking about the logistics, I think it's better to talk as soon as possible about what we expect and how we're going to do it.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts!

We’ve broken up twice before because we thought we couldn’t handle the distance, but every time we come back to each other — because the love is real.\n\nThe problem is her family. They don’t allow her to date at all. If they found out about me, she could lose her phone, her freedom, everything. So she can’t tell them about me, while my whole family knows and supports us.\n\nOur only way of being together is through late-night calls. Every night we fall asleep on the phone together. It’s what keeps me going. But she’s about to move into a new house and share a room with her sister, who doesn’t know about me. That means no more calls. Just texting. And deep down we both know we probably can’t survive like that.\n\nLast night she told me she feels like she’s holding me back, that I sacrifice too much for us.

We have been together for 6 years, and coupled up just before COVID. We originally bonded over shared hobbies (board games, hiking, etc.) and spent much of COVID doing these things and getting closer. It has not all been good, and there have been ups and downs throughout the relationship. In the beginning, we were going through fights, broke up, and got back together. Around the 3-year mark, my partner's career really took off, and she put a ton of hours into work. I was very supportive and tried to take care of meals, and gave her space. I also work very hard and its been good thing for both of us at times. Though as a result, though, our adventure stopped, but I kept going on solo trips and traveling with friends. We did have a few nice vacations, but the periods between our special moments started to get longer and longer. Over time, it's been clear that we were both unhappy, intimacy slowed down, and fights increased in regularity. Things got really combative, and it seems like every fight she was trying to win, rather than trying to resolve the issues. This year, we started to go to couples therapy, and it helped some, but I think it helped more because there was a 3rd party mediator in the discussion. We've since stopped therapy after many sessions. Intimacy has all but ceased over the last 4 months, and I feel like I can't do anything right. We had a pretty big fight, and my partner suggested breaking up for the 3rd time this year. I convinced her to give it one more try, but over the past few weeks, it's clear that we are on our last limb. We are still bickering. I feel like I always say the wrong thing to trigger her. After I essentially broke down, we decided to go no contact for a few days, and I feel like a weight has been lifted and im much happier. I'm convinced that we are going to break up, and it does make me sad because I care about her.\n\nThe hard part of all of this is that she is great on paper. She is ambitious, funny, and beautiful. But we just didn't seem to be able to make it work. I read a lot of these Reddit posts, and folks here have much bigger problems (infidelity, abuse, lying, controlling behaviors, jealousy), and we don't have any of that. I feel like we are not a good team. I think I can be a bit emotionless (that's how my family is) sometimes, and she wants someone who is very \"performative\". In contrast, I want to feel like a team during the tough times, and she can be a bit combative (that's how her family is)\n\nHas anybody felt this way?

We just started long distance, and I honestly feel like things aren’t the same anymore.\n\nI recently went to visit him for a week, and during that time I don’t think I laughed with him once. I didn’t really feel love, or that he makes me happy. Instead, I felt ignored a lot of the time or like I was “too much” for him. I’m a very active, happy, excitable person, and he’s super laid back — but instead of balancing each other out, it feels like he brings me down.\n\nWhen we were together in bed or on the couch, there weren’t many signs of affection.

This was my first real adult relationship. I realized that even though I had compromised on so much of what is important to me, my needs were still not being met. I had brought up so many times the things that are important to me, and was dismissed or given an empty promise or excuse each time. \n\nI really don't think what I was asking for was unreasonable. I wanted him to get an STI test, make a continuing effort to learn about my religion/culture/language, take some sort of certification class (he currently works as a cashier), and a few other things. Things that would improve his life as well as our relationship. There was always some sort of excuse. He signed up for a class after the ultimatum and did the other things after the relationship ended. He has also made comments about his time running out to start a family, that he feels like he achieved his goal of getting a girl, and other similar comments that make me feel like he is settling for me. I was left feeling like I was not worthy of him actually wanting to do these things. \n\nThese past few months, I realized something has been feeling off/missing. I was searching for excuses to end the relationship because I couldn't find something \"valid enough\". So I did something I never thought I would do: an ultimatum stating that if something didn't change soon, I'm out. He did make some small changes and met some of my needs after that. But I did not like the fact that an ultimatum was what it took, and realized he does not really check as many of my boxes as I thought he did. So I made the difficult decision the end the relationship. \n\nHe reached out the other day, and we spoke for a bit.

I, of course, still love him and care about him and don't want to miss out on something good. The good times were really good. So I am conflicted. How do I know things will be different?

Basically, I need help understanding what to do about this guy I've been talking to in Italy.\n\nI'm just about to graduate from my studies, and travel has been the most important goal to me for a few years now. I spent 6 weeks on exchange to Italy when I was 16, and got very close with my exchange sister who stayed in my country for 6 weeks as well. We've stayed in touch ever since.\n\nI revisited her 2 years ago for a week and met all her friends, one of whom is now my penpal. I have always wanted to return to Italy, and maybe live there or visit often from France where I know the language better; but I've had to wait until I finish my studies before I can do anything about it. \n\nI'll call my penpal Joe. I met Joe at a party with my exchange sister where he's part of her friend group. He asked to take me to breakfast the next day after the party, but he cancelled because he was embarrassed about the language barrier. I ended up leaving Italy a few days later. \n\n\nNow, two years later, about a month ago I swiped up on his friends story saying how cute I thought Joe had gotten. He told me to text him and that we would find a way around the language barrier. \n\nI was never too seriously interested, but because I want to come back to Italy I knew I'd want to see him, and it would be nice/fun to have a small connection or an online cultural exchange. \n\n\nWe text every day and send audio messages. He uses ChatGPT to translate and his English without it is pretty basic, but he's trying to learn. I've started learning Italian but I'm making slow progress.\n\nI pour my heart out to him and he asks me all sorts of questions and shares his views. It's become a part of my routine now to wake up excited because I get to see what he's written to me. We've turned up the heat a little on flirting and sharing honestly with each other and it's kinda scaring the shit out of me. We talk about when I come back to Italy and if he could come to Australia or we meet somewhere in the middle. We both say how we wish it would happen sooner but we can't because of schedules and money. \n\nThe thing is: I'm not stupid. I know I'm quite terrified of commitment and romantic relationships despite never staying single for long. This last year I made a commitment to being single and I've been successful. This feels almost like a way for me to dip my toes in knowing it could end at any point or likely go no where - I might find I don't like him as much in person, or the language and cultural barrier is too much. Or the distance becomes unmanageable if neither of us can live in the same cities long term. \n\nI guess I just need to hear people's views on this, and share any stories or guidance they might have if they've been in the same boat. \n\n\nI don't want to get more attached, but I also really like talking to him and get so excited imagining being with him finally.

We do not live together. A few months ago, right after she started a new job, she mentioned randomly on a phone call that she had met a really cool guy (30's M) at work. I was happy that she had made a friend at her new job and that was that. The next day he came up in conversation again. I heard about him a third day in a row and saw she had been texting with him on Instagram as she was doing it while sitting next to me on the couch and the text bubbles looked to be large. It was during this time that I had felt our texting, mainly on her side, had become stale and brief.\n\nThe frequent mentions of him and the reduction in our texting concerned me so I expressed that I was uncomfortable with this new friendship and the level of friendly communication they seemed to be engaging in outside of work while our texting seemed to be faltering. She apologized and immediately expressed this to her coworker and that she needed to tone texting down and she did. I did not ask her to do that but appreciated it and felt it was the best response. I don't have a problem with her having male friends. She has multiple male friends from before we were dating that I know and have no problem with her communicating with or being around though to date she has only hung out with them at the same time as me. I haven't set things up that way for the record.\n\nHe has come up multiple times in discussions and I am told that he's a friend and nothing more. However, they seem to be texting throughout the day and she texts him even when we're supposed to be on a date together. I never hear about any of her other male friends anymore, only him. Sometimes he is mentioned in conjunction with another work friend who is a 40's F. I do think men and women can be friends but I don't know many men that will text a woman all the time that he doesn't have some level of interest in. She said she talks about me all the time and he is  well aware of me.\n\nTwo weeks ago I told her I was on my way to checking out due to this new friendship and the fact that she never wants to go on dates and instead prefers to stay in which we've discussed multiple times. She apologized but didn't really explain why she went back on limiting communication. We've had two dates since where she texted him during the first and facetimed him during the second to show him what we were doing. I consider this disrespectful unless of course its an emergency and would be bothered regardless of who she was texting. It hurt more since we had discussed phone usage on dates a week before this. To me a date is a time in which two people prioritize each other. I expressed my displeasure again with this and she apologized again.\n\nIn my view, my gf is the most important non-relative woman in my life and I prioritize my relationship with her over that of other women within reason. I am still friendly and cordial but I could not imagine texting a female coworker in the same manner she has been texting hers. She described this view as old fashioned and said she used to hold it but now sees what she's doing as okay because they're just friends and she only loves me. She says that my discomfort makes her feel like I don't trust her. I do trust her, I just don't think I should have to compete against another man for her attention on dates or when we're hanging out. To me, frequently texting someone of the opposite sex much like her and I did early on is a way to invite unintentional feelings and therefore disrespectful to the relationship.\n\nI feel as though my concerns are being dismissed and she's prioritizing this friendship of 2 months over our relationship of 12 months.\n\nIs there a way back from this or is the relationship already over due to this being a fundamental incompatibility?\n\nTLDR: Gf texts new male coworker friend of 2 months frequently during our dates and time together despite me expressing discomfort over the situation and I feel my concerns are dismissed affecting out 1 year relationship.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

I’m pretty much stuck in a situationship. He told me about 6 months ago that if we were to be together it would take maybe 1-2 years because he was unsure of where he’s at in his life or what to do with it. He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me. So I’m genuinely confused by all of this. \n\nNow he’s apologised and said he’s giving me time and space to figure out what I want and where I want to go from here which has really confused me because I’ve always been open about how I feel about him and that I wanted to meet him in person and see if we could start a relationship which is something at the start of us talking, he was open to but now he’s completely against it. He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. I don’t really know how to speak to him again. I miss him like crazy, I felt like we had some kind of bond and he agreed but now he’s switched up completely, he even says he never misses people so I guess I’ll fall into the category. \n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute he acts as if we are in a committed relationship i.e we made an agreement not to do anything sexual or even touch ourselves unless we were both doing it, things like that which hint to being in a relationship then I ask him what we are or talk about my feelings and he shuts it down. He tells me he does genuinely care about me and everything else and part of me believes in his own way he does but right now I feel like I’ve wasted 9 months but at the same time I haven’t really because he’s helped me through a lot of shit at the same time - I feel attached to him but I don’t think it’s necessarily a good attachment.\n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me.

I asked him what his plan is for Friday evening and he said: “I just bought a new shirt and maybe in the evening I will just go have a pizza” (4:30pm his time). We messaged a bit and then later at 5pm his time, he sent me this (and I was away from my phone):\n5:00pm “Time for a call but I have to move to the dinner “my name””\n5:00pm [Missed call - he tried to call me but I was away from my phone]\n5:25pm: Sends me a selfie wearing a jacked and shirt (and this outfit was different than the one he was wearing in the morning)\n \nI didn’t check my phone until just few minutes after his last message and saw that he tried to call me (which is strange because he never does that. He always messages me if I was up for a call an hour in advance and then I send him a Zoom link). I then sent him a message “Want to call?” But it was left unread and he didn’t open WhatsApp until three hours later. \n \nI felt very strange and had a weird feeling during these hours because:\n(1) He suddenly disappeared\n(2) He was being vague with his plans. Usually when he goes out with friends, he still checks his phone and send me messages/photos of dinner, friends etc but this time he mentioned that “it was him going out for pizza” alone?\n(3) He gave me a call on WhatsApp at 5pm and it was strange because he never does that. It seems that he knew in advance that he wouldn’t be able to call me or text me later during these three hours and he was hoping he would talk to me right before he goes in and “disappears” \n \nThree hours later at 8:30pm his time, he came back and sent me these messages:\n“[calls my name]”\n“My internet connection is not good”\n“:(“\n“Strange”\n“I’m now walking home but it is so strange that there was no internet”\n-Sends a screenshot of him attempting to message me earlier when he was [assumingly at the restaurant] but WhatsApp wasn’t loading for him/his 5G wasn’t working at the restaurant-\n“I am now at home”\n“But it was really strange”\n \nOverall, I felt it was strange that he had no internet in the restaurant. So his 5G wasn’t working inside the restaurant? He could still have asked if the restaurant had WiFi. Also, if he wasn’t able to use his phone at all during these three hours, so he was just having a dinner by himself for three hours? I find that strange. I go out to dinners by myself alone but even if my phone wasn’t working, it usually doesn’t take me three hours as I get bored just sitting by myself.\n \nThe reason why I find that suspicious is because I know that in phones it’s possible to manually disable the internet connection to WhatsApp or any other app specifically and then he could send me a screenshot that his messages weren’t being delivered to me. \n \nLater when he got home, he sent me more messages and (cheap <100$ per night) hotel suggestions for our October trip and I didn’t even bother checking my phone and didn’t reply to anything because I just felt confused and upset. Was he acting sketchy/shady? Or am I overthinking it?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

That he’s enjoying being single etc because he can focus on his happiness and he doesn’t have to be responsible for anyone else’s (I admit there’s times where I’ve been clingy wondering why he hasn’t responded or if he’s talking to other women) he told me he’s not looking for a relationship or talking to anyone else but if he was ready for one, I would be his only choice and that there’s nobody else.\n\nCut a long story short - I called his bluff, I told him I was going to start dating other guys and that we could be friends if he was open to that. He agreed but he was very distant afterwards, it ended up in an argument and I asked him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore and he said not if we’re arguing so I told him it’s best we don’t talk and he started asking if I was for real etc. \n\nBefore he told me he didn’t miss anyone and didn’t get easily emotionally attached to anyone, not even his ex wife which is why he left her. Weeks ago told me he rarely misses people as a response to me saying I missed him. After our argument and after I said it’s best we don’t talk he told me he thinks about me throughout his day and that he misses me and if I left he would miss me a lot and that he doesn’t want things to end. \n\nI feel like this is a big thing him finally opening up to me but still I have so much to decide upon, he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship but treats it like we’re in one. Maybe I’m just too overbearing at times… I’ve been used to being lied to and cheated on that I don’t trust easily and sometimes when he goes quiet I will assume the worst. He told me he likes his own space and his ex wife never used to give him that which is part of the reason he doesn’t want a relationship.\n\nI don’t know if he will change his mind and I’m probably dumb for waiting around but after our argument I feel like I need him in my life. I hate not having him because he always gives the best advice, he’s supportive (not very emotional) but he seems to understand me - a lot of people don’t.\n\nTL:DR LDR/situationship told me he thinks about me throughout the day - not sure this means much but I found it sweet. He also told me he misses me and would miss me if we didn’t talk. Still no sign of him committing but I care about him so much as stupid as it sounds.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/Filodendron42_166", "user": "u/Filodendron42", "text": "Boyfriend wants to “work on himself”\n\nI (27f) and my boyfriend (28m) a bit less than a year ago, both of us studying in a 3rd country. We became close very quick, practically lived together for a year before he had to leave the country this June. I also went home to my home country due to many reasons, and while I was home my beloved dad unexpectedly departed to a nicer world. I stayed at my home country for the whole summer, supporting family and finding comfort for myself too. My boyfriend came to visit, even a few days after the tragedy happened, providing me support for a few days, and we met up halfway once too. So went to living together to seeing each other once a month in a turbulent way with challenging circumstances.\n\nNow I am back in the city where we met - alone. Lots of getting used to, without him, without my dad at home. I’m trying to stay afloat. It’s a wild rollercoaster, sometimes I’m motivated and productive, but I have my bad days and occasional breakdowns. I could really use some support, care, affection.\n\nOn my bf’s side, he moved out of our shared city because he had to, not because he wanted to. We both live in Europe, no time difference, but both on a student budget so visits aren’t every 2 weeks.\n\nHe’s also struggling with a few things; wanted to find a job here, for a year he couldn’t and had to move, now he’s living with his family; big change in living conditions and general circumstances. His master program started this week, but he’s not particularly excited to be back to school, this was his safety plan only.\n\nWhen I expressed that i would appreciate a bit more support, he said he needs to focus on himself, because “he can’t be there for me if he can’t be there for himself in the first place”. We had many talks about this during the summer, when he had nothing to do, was doing sports all day, and became a little distant.\n\nI decided to give him some space, texting him less and reaching out less. He sometimes wouldn’t text for 6-8 hours, forgetting to say goodnight bc “he’s too tired”, not texting back or not updating me on anything unless I ask.\n\nOn my part, like before, I can’t wait to tell him things, I want to send pictures, videos. He was sceptical about going long distance, although in less than 2 years we could close the gap. I encouraged him saying we can watch stuff together, organise date nights, send letters or whatever on the post, use funny apps to stay connected, even visit almost every month!!\n\nI’m at a halt now. I really don’t want to break up. We are good and can be so in love when we’re together, I can’t wait to build a life with him. I was hoping when school starts for him he’ll have a routine and will feel a little more in place, but he’s still a little distant, isn’t bothered about me taking back a little.\n\nHow do you guys see the situation? I also don’t want to go on a “break” as that wouldn’t lead to anything good imo. This is worth so much more than to just let it go, but I’m afraid I’m annoying him and I don’t want him to resent me. What do you reckon I should do, what strategy or attitude should I follow? Any similar experiences?\n\nTLDR: moved LDR a few months ago from living together 1+ year, and in these few months I lost my dad and now am living at our place without him, alone, while he claims he needs to focus on himself now, that’s why he can’t be as supportive or affectionate, and became distant. What approach should I take? How do you see this?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I don't know what to do [23F and 23F]\n\nMy LD partner of \\~8 months (1.5 years if you count the weird-homoerotic-situationship-friendship stage, yes seriously) confessed to me a couple of days ago that she had 'sexted' someone else once 5 months ago before telling them she can't ever do it again. This is a person I have been suspicious of before- when I've asked my partner before if this person had been flirty with her, she said \"I don't think so, no\" which I now know was a lie. This person also knows that we are in a relationship, or just generally that my partner is taken. I know the two of them were on a trip together about 2 months ago with other people present on the trip, (I know for certain because I know other people who went) which I knew about and my partner asked me for permission to go on because she knew I had suspicions about this person. My partner maintains that nothing happened on this trip, and nothing happened after the one incident as the other person was respectful of her telling her she didn't want to do anything like that. Me and my partner both don't really like this person for reasons of a whole other Lesbian Drama nature so I'm inclined to believe her.\n\nI'm really upset about this, but I of course wanted to look more into it. My partner provided me with the screenshots and has been very forthcoming about any and all questions I've had and requests for evidence. It really doesn't seem like 'sexting' rather just this person being very forward and sexual with my partner on one occasion and then my partner just giving bland/deflecting responses before telling her a couple days later that she can't do anything like that. She confirmed to me that thats how she felt in the moment, like she just wanted to deflect it (we both have anxiety so while I'm mad she didn't straight up tell her no, I get it in a way). So my main bit of upset is the fact that she waited to tell me for 5 months, because it's not 'as bad' as I thought. She said that she was just really scared about how I would handle the information which makes sense but I stressed to her that stuff like this just gains more weight the longer you go without being honest.\n\nI don't really know what to do or how to proceed- I've never been cheated on before, and I don't even know that I would consider it cheating, just lying. I also don't have a lot of relationship experience to begin with. I really do love this girl, and my heart is telling me not to break up with her. We've been basically finalizing her next visit these past couple of weeks, too, so my heart is really excited (dedicated? I guess?) to the idea of her coming. But I'm a little depressed right now so it's hard to know how to proceed or if it would be right to proceed. I feel like everyone would look down on me or think I was stupid if I did, or like the universe is somehow telling me to break it off. But you know how depression is- it just tries to convince you to burn everything down and run away. So I don't know if my feelings are just because of that or if there's more validity to them. After all, a LDR is serious. If we continue to date and it gets more serious to the point of moving, it would mean so much effort and change for me.\n\nAny advice is appreciated but please be gentle.

Recently one of the bartenders “Stacy” asked did my neighbors number and I gave it to her and they hit it off immediately. So I asked Stacy if another bartender there was single. Stacy had talked to her and she said that the woman “Cindy” thought that I was cute. So next time we were there I talked to Cindy, and I got her number. Stacy told me after that Cindy really enjoyed our conversation and was excited to go out. So we went on a double date. Stacy had also warned me that Cindy hadn’t dated in 4 years and her last relationship was really bad. So I should take it slow. So I did, I was really respectful, I made sure she was comfortable the whole time and I didn’t make any moves on her. \n\nThe date was probably the best date I’ve ever had. Her personality was great, we had so many random things in common. At the end of the night she asked me to take her home so i did. We talked in the car for a bit, and then she invited me in. She gave me a tour and we talked on the couch for maybe another 30 minutes. Again knowing she wanted to go slow I didn’t try anything. At this point it was 2am and I had to be at work at 6:30am so I left. I gave her a hug and went home. Before I could go to bed Stacy called and told me that she had just got off the phone with Cindy and that Cindy was saying that she was really into me and that she liked that I wasn’t just trying to sleep with her, and she liked our conversations. So I was feeling pretty good about things. \n\nWe kept texting and I did notice a drop off. She maybe texted me 1/3 of the amount she used to. She then sent me a message saying she wanted to start out as friends and then she canceled our second date saying she had to do something with her roommate, and didn’t really respond when I asked her to lmk when she’d be freed up again. I spoke with Stacy last night and she said that Cindy had been saying that she was nervous to go out again. That she felt like the date went too good.

We've been dating for a couple months now but i've known him since the start of this year. For context, I met him through a friend that I went to high school with who now goes to university with him in a different state. My friend is a great person and she's been friends with him for a long while now.\n\nI'm flying to him the first time because I've gotten to know his brother quite a bit through him and he's invited me to his wedding (otherwise he'd have to come to me).\n\nMy boyfriend is super happy for me to go and i'm just as excited to finally meet him and his family. However, in this economy, I still live at home with my mom which means I still live under her rules. Don't get me wrong, she's not going to stop me from going as I am an adult and I can afford to pay for my own needs (even though he's paying for my flight and i'm staying with him and his parents since he also lives at home).\n\nMy mother is extremely traditional so she's not used to this online relationship type of thing and I understand where she's coming from when she says she's worried about me going alone and such, which is in turn making me super anxious about going (and i already have anxiety on top of this).\n\nMy boyfriend and I have facetimed and talked over the phone countless times, even in front of her and his parents love me from the little amount l've gotten to speak to them as well. However, my mother refuses to talk to him or try to work something out with me. She says the only way she'll be at peace letting me go is if I take my brother (who is a teenager and is at that point where he thinks making fun of me is peak comedy. he's also AWFUL around people he doesn't know well) OR he comes here for a weekend so she can meet him. For him, that would either be an 8 hour drive or an 1hr flight that costs way too much.\n\nI just need some advice on how to calm her nerves. Or should | just tell her to come with me? But I don't want her helicoptering over me anymore either.\n\nShe already has my location 24/7, as she's had since i was 12 and I call her so frequently that she'd immediately know if something was wrong.

I don’t even know why or what started it anymore. I genuinely feel like I’m delirious at this point.\n\nIt started on Monday morning. I worked out, showered, ate, and after working out I texted her, “I’m finished,” and sent her a cute reel from Instagram — because usually, I just scroll through my fitness-related content on there, which I like. Then she replied, “So you’ve been on Insta?”\n\nBut the first message I sent her after working out was, “I’m finished working out and I’m back now, baby.” After that, she was just dry.\n\nAlso, my house is tiny — everyone’s everywhere. I’ve got the PS5 console in my room, so my little brother comes in to play. My dad’s chilling in his room, and my mum is in the living room. I can’t even talk to her (my girl) properly, and she was getting irritated over that too.\n\nThen the next day was just… dry. No call, just texting. Isolation and distance, I guess. I went to sleep at 11 PM, and she usually wakes up at 12 AM for me. But I had to sleep early because I had a wedding the next day. I needed to be up at 7 AM to work out, do some tasks, get a haircut, and then pick up my mum’s makeup artist.\n\nI woke up to texts from her saying I don’t give a fuck about the relationship, that we haven’t talked at all, that I could’ve tried staying awake — and that she’s done asking for my time.\n\nThen wedding day came. Literally no texting from either side. I left my house at 2 PM and didn’t get home until 3 AM. Then I get texts from her saying, “You were doing all your activities without wondering or worrying about me, or even asking me anything.”\n\nLike… what? I barely even used my phone. I only took pictures and videos at the wedding — and honestly, I only take them to show her. Otherwise, I wouldn’t bother.\n\nI go to sleep after going back and forth with her for a bit. Wake up at 1 PM in a daze. Got up, ate, prayed. She was already home. We got on a call — she wasn’t even talking. (This is today, by the way.)\n\nI tried talking and calling her, but nothing was working. So I’m thinking, what can I even do? I’m not going to sit there for four hours like a muppet, constantly saying her name.\n\nThen she texts me saying, “Can you please stop talking, please. Just for once.”\nSo I say, “Alright, sure thing,” and I stop talking.\n\nJump to now — about 1–2 hours ago — I was helping my mum prepare food for guests coming tomorrow. After I finished, it was around 1 AM. I said hi to her and stuff because I know the situation we’re in, and then I said I was going to sleep.\n\nBut obviously, I wasn’t actually going to sleep — I meant it as a joke. (I do that a lot, like saying “I’m going shopping with my dad, so we can’t call,” and she gets upset, but then I say I’m joking.)\n\nThis time, though, when I said I was going to sleep, she just basically crashed out. And she’s still crashing out now — it’s 2:30 AM as I’m writing this.\n\nKeep in mind: I try to keep a good sleep routine so I can maintain my diet. I try to sleep at 10 or 11 PM, even though it’s the holidays, just so I can get good rest and lose weight — which she knows.\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not looking for validation, but I just want an outside perspective on this.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

{"id": "u/ohawhatsthat_1691", "user": "u/ohawhatsthat", "text": "Anxiety about closing the gap and how to make it work (Germany - UK)\n\nI’ve had these thoughts for a while, sometimes they just creep up and are made worse by my anxiety, but in general this is what I think about a lot. \n\nI am in Germany, my partner is in the UK. We are the same age but he’s so much further in life: living alone, bought his own place, car, has a good job, a good social circle. I feel like I am so behind, everything he has, I don’t have. \n\nGenerally it would be easier for me to move to him, I speak his language while he doesn’t speak mine, I don’t really have anything holding me here except for my family and even that I’m fine with leaving, as harsh as that sounds. And in general, I think life in the UK would be better for me than life for him in Germany. \n\nWe’ve been together for six months and we have had conversations about closing the gap etc. but I feel that we have very different view points on how this is going to work out, like our timelines are not matching. He thinks it’s as easy as just applying to jobs, getting a skilled worker visa, and I’m set. \n\nI’m doing my driving license now, something that he pushed for which I appreciate to have his support on, I would have liked to move out and live on my own first, preferably in a different city in my country, find a new job here to gain more experience before seriously applying to the UK, because I can’t just apply for “funsies, memes and yolo” like him. I want to put effort into it so I have the best chance of actually getting accepted. How it’s going to work there is another question and issue, like getting to London since he lives in a different city and I don’t think I’ll find a job in my field there, but that’s an issue that can be solved. \n\nI told him from the beginning that closing the gap for real would be at least another year, most likely longer. I know it sucks and i also want it to happen sooner but how is this going to work? Right now I’m doing the license, that’s at least another 2-3 months until I have it, another few until I’m actually very confident in driving alone. Then it’s looking for a job and place to live here, which I don’t want to leave after only a year. I mean, leaving a job after a year that’s fine whatever, but the apartment won’t even be done within a year and I wouldn’t want to move after such a short time and waste all that money. Even if I do leave after a year, that’s still at least another year and a half until I can seriously think about going to the UK. Of course I could also apply to places in the UK at the same time, but with my current CV and experience I highly doubt it’s going to go anywhere. I got really fucked by covid unfortunately and I’ve been trying to gain more work experience and show that I can do stuff, but there’s still doubt in my mind about it. \n\nPlease don’t misunderstand, I love him and I want to be with him. Maybe it’s just my anxiety about everything in general, maybe he’s right and it’s not as big of a deal as I make it to be. If we were in the same country, I would leave everything behind and move to him. If the UK was still in the EU it would also be easier but as it is now, it is not easy for me.\n\nThere is also something to be said about his family. We haven’t met yet but from what he tells me, his parents wanted him to end up with an Indian girl, marry, have kids, etc. and most of all, they want him / us to have a plan. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, but am I wrong in saying we have only been together half a year and I can’t give them a step by step timeline of the next ten years? I asked him if they really expect us to get married within a year and he said they probably do. Of course I want to marry him, kids I am very much on the fence about, but how am I supposed to give him a plan of our life when I don’t even know what next week is going to look like? \n\nWe visit every 6-8 weeks and spend at least a week together in person, we even had our first vacation together recently, video call every day, even when he’s traveling and the time difference is huge. We still make it work. Of course I want our visits to turn into our everyday lives but I just don’t know how to do it right now. \n\nNow, this is completely just my anxiety talking because he hasn’t given me any indication like pulling away, talking less etc. but I’m scared I will lose him. We are best friends and we love each other, how we make each other feel and express our gratitude for each other every day. But I can’t say that I would blame him if he left, I know that my anxiety and me in general can be a lot to handle and I hate that I am putting him through this. I know there are couples who have been together for years before closing the gap and they made it work too. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like when I bring it up, it usually leads to him disagreeing (in a sweet and kind way, but disagreeing nonetheless) because his brain just works differently, which he also already acknowledged as well. \n\nAre there any encouraging insights from people who have been doing this a long time or have already closed the gap?

Secondly, I know that an hour apart isn’t really a LDR to most, but I (54m) can’t drive, and she (55f) a registered nurse, has WAY too much going on to be able to drive here. \n\nWe met on a dating site way back in June of 2020 and hit it off right away. A month after we started talking I sent a bouquet of flowers to her work where she got them upon arrival. After messaging me she said that nobody gave her flowers before. \nAfter messaging each other for a couple of months she drove here and we got to know each other even more. The second (date) was even better, and we considered ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend at that time. She was working at a senior physical rehabilitation center, where shifts were 16 hours long, five or six days a week. She hated the place, so there were times where she would drive straight here immediately afterward and stay the night. I should add that there was extreme drama at her home. One adult child living at home and is a total narcissist, so she was escaping from that. \nFrom time to time I would take an Uber or Lyft to go visit her. Sixty to eighty dollars to get there and the same amount to get back. \nNow, what has kept us from closing the gap has been her family. Both of her parents have had dementia, and it was getting worse for them. Sometimes she would have to leave here and go back home to take care of them. Her mother would occasionally get extremely emotional and reach out to my gf. Between work, her parents, and drama at home, the only escape was to me. \nShe was divorced from a narcissist, who verbally and mentally abused her a lot, for twenty five years. I applaud her for leaving him. \nFast forward to last year, her mother died a week after visiting me, and she took it HARD. She left my house June third and went to her parents house, where she found her mother in bad shape. Took her mom to the ER, but mom never recovered. I haven’t seen her in person since then. I did set up a Gofundme to help pay for everything. In September of last year she told me that she wanted to take a break from the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship as she wouldn’t be able to give me the attention that I deserve. So I backed up and let her do what she needed to. I told her that I love her and would be there in case she needed anything. Her dad is still alive and kicking, living in a senior home, with dementia worse than her mother’s was. \nI have been supporting her, complimenting her, messaging her, and occasionally video chatting. But it’s been less and less in this span of time since June third last year. I finally asked her what she thought about our future, and it took a day to respond. She said she’s not sure. She wants it to work, but isn’t sure if we’re as compatible as when we first met. I know that we are, but I find that we’ve grown apart because I let her take care of things there. She even went as far as to say that I can move on, but I’m not ready to do that. I mean, I’m not ready to date at all at this point.\nIn that time she has decided to sell her house and move into her mom and dad’s, take care of dad whenever possible, work, and basically paying less attention to me.\nAt this point I’m considering telling her that I’m letting her go. Telling her that I can’t sit here, waiting for responses from her, day in and day out. Also, telling her that if she wants to get back together with me, I will welcome her back with open arms. However, she will need to be the one to make the move, not me. \nOne final thing, I have a kid with my ex, so I can’t move. \n\nThoughts?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I don't know what to think or feel\n\nWe dated for about 6 years. We never met in person. Covid happened, then I had a pretty intense autistic burnout (diagnosed, not speculated) that I'm still recovering from. \n\nWe stuck together through everything. We were each other's best friend. We have shared life goals, values, and interests. We have had our arguments and problems, but we overcame them and got through it stronger than before. I would have married him the moment I met him. I was that confident in our partnership. \n\nIn July, I said he should come meet my puppies. He responded saying that he thought we should break up. \n\nHis parents were having unexpected health issues and increasingly relying on him. My dad is developing dementia, and we had already agreed that I cannot leave my family here. \n\nSo, he felt we should break up due to these circumstances. \n\nI was gutted, but I amicably agreed. I wasn't going to cry and beg him to stay or pressure him to change his mind. I accepted it. I fought through the horrible, relentless pain of that loss because I didn't want to lose him as a friend, too.\n\n(This year has been a shit show. My therapy dog died, my cat died, my sister is moving to the opposite side of the world. A lot of loss. Our breakup was an ocean of grief, and I was already drowning.)\n\nYesterday, I told him that we couldn't be some messy, in-between *thing* of being emotionally entrenched like romantic partners, but just friends. I said no one we dated would be okay with that, and our friendship would inevitably end. He said he still felt we could overcome this and be together again. Then he said he would stop messaging for a while to work through how he feels. \n\nI'm baffled. I'm sick. I'm so overwhelmed. \n\nI know humans are irrational. I'm irrational.

He keeps bringing up that he wants to have sex with me—like, not super direct, but it’s obvious. I’ve already told him I’m not ready yet, but every time I say no or try to avoid the topic, he suddenly loses interest or gets moody, which leads to arguments.\n\nWe’ve already argued like three times over the same thing.

The problem is, when I say I’m not ready, he gets upset and his mood changes—he becomes cold and distant.\n\nEarlier, he said we should either break up to avoid hurting each other, or stay together but he’ll stop being sweet and affectionate because he doesn't want to hurt me when he gets irritated. I’m so confused because I really want to stay. He said he loves me and doesn’t want to lose me, but at the same time, he’s struggling with his feelings and desires.\n\nNow, he’s asking if we could try doing something sexual over video call—like touching ourselves while watching each other. Honestly, I’m curious and I do want to do it with him, but I still feel insecure about my body and I’m scared to show it. I also wonder if his medications for his heart condition are affecting his sex drive and mood swings.\n\nI don’t know what to doooo.\nWhat should I do huhuhu? I really want to work this out.

So I’ll start with me, I’m 14 (almost 15), and earlier on this year I had gotten myself into a relationship that hasn’t ended well at all. My girlfriend, who I haven’t met before, but is exactly my perfect type, (it’s in the looks, the personality, the voice, and that I find most girls from the USA so damn hot) has loved me for a while. She is extremely happy about the relationship (or well, was) and would always call and text me whenever she could. Until the 9th or August I believe, when her parents forced her to block me. Now she struggles bad with her mental health, and I knew this could mean that without being there to comfort her her, she could spiral really fast. And that was exactly what I didn’t want. In the text she talked about how her parents went through her phone and found out about us and that she had to block me. For the time that I was blocked, I was worried sick, and luckily she came back around less than a week later because she was being a lil sneaky thing and snuck behind her parents back to talk to me. We were both crying and at that point I was depressed and wouldn’t speak to anyone or do anything u enjoyed for the time I had lost her. And blah blah blah I don’t think anyone really needs to know about anything UNTIL.. It happened again.\n\nHer parents went through her phone and found out about us again. Luckily my girlfriend told me it was going to happen and gave me some details to work with to get her back. She isn’t allowed to have her phone for a whole year, or date anyone at all until 21 or possibly if she moved out and her parents were feeling generous (which they never are, those evil bastards). We used to call on discord a lot because we both played games on our PC and we enjoyed the screen sharing part, that wasn’t were we mainly called though, we talked on Snap, TikTok, and iMessages too.\n\nWhat I do know currently: \n- She doesn’t have access to her phone for a year\n- She has blocked me on every social\n- I know her full name and address\n- And weirdly enough, through the use of an alt Snapchat account, I found out that she has been online in the last 24 hours\n- She normally uses her phone after she has woken up (around 12-2pm EST), so any contact would have to be attempted after or around that time.\n\nSo loosing her again basically destroyed me, I thought about suicide and have been for this week, I’ve tried suicide prevention services, and I’ve talked to close friends. But it never seems to be enough, I feel like I have a void inside deep inside of me that is ripping me apart day by day. I did send her voice-memos despite being blocked on iMessages because I thought there would be a possibility that she would see them in the future. And I have been blocked one of my alt Snapchat accounts, as of now, my second alt hasn’t been blocked. \n\nNow I am basically venting about it here on Reddit, because I loved her and she is now 1 of 3 people I have lost contact with in sad ways (whether that be suicide or abusive parenting),but I’m also asking for any help or advice regarding getting her back. I will try near to anything to get her back, it’s messing with my mental health, education, and overall mood throughout the day. But for now I’ll leave this post to sit and  probably leave it here.

Currently, she is based in Houston, Texas, and we initially met while I was working in the Middle East. Our relationship has faced numerous challenges, especially with visa processing and navigating each other's schedules. We have been exploring the idea of meeting in a neutral country that has fewer visa restrictions, making it easier for both of us to travel.\n\nOver the course of our relationship, we have had extensive discussions about our future together, including the possibility of settling down and getting married. However, this journey has been emotionally taxing, particularly due to the time difference between our locations. I have tried to be flexible with my travel plans, but she has faced challenges of her own. She's been held back by the finalization of her divorce paperwork. Although she has been separated from her husband for three years, he has been unwilling to sign the documents necessary to finalize the divorce.\n\nAt this point, I find myself feeling less hopeful about our situation. I struggle with the thought of wasting time caught in this complicated maze, and I feel that the best course of action might be to move on.

(Lets call him Muha)\n\nShe has told me that they both used to like each other and they both have flirted and been romantic, and used to say \"I love you\" and stuff like that to each other. But they never officially dated, they both were in a situation ship. But my girlfriend told Muha that we started dating so they stopped, but remained friends. Me and Muha have never talked to each other before, we don't know each other, but we know ABOUT each other. \n\nRecently, just a week ago, I talked to one of my girlfriends female friend (lets call her Nash), I've known Nash since I've known my girlfriend, we all are in a group chat. Nash, Muha, and my girlfriend used to be close friends in a separate group chat way back then. \n\nI texted her friend asking about Muha, because I wanted to know more about their past. And she told me how they used to flirt etc. And she showed me everything in their group chat, and I saw how my girlfriend still seems overly friendly with him and shows him a lot of care, like the same care she shows me, and sometimes it slightly seems like she has feelings for him because she has slightly babied him too. The group chat is still alive. \n\nI asked my girlfriend if I could talk to Muha and discuss some boundaries I want between you both. And she said yes. She made a group chat with me, Muha, and herself. Me and my girlfriend were waiting for him to come online and he was taking a while and then I had to go offline for some time.. when I cam back, I saw that Muha and my girlfriend were talking to each other and talking about random stuff, and there were 700+ messages in a span of 1 hour. And my girlfriend was talking to him really enthusiastically like hes a super close trusted female friend. He also acts like a female, his profile, PFP, texting style, everything. So that made me feel really weird and jealous.. \n\nI started talking to him for the first time respectfully, and I started talking about the first boundary I wanted, and he immediately started being rude, he switched his tone with me. He was making weird jokes and said stuff like \"You seem really serious lol\", \"I'm not gonna steal your girl bro\" and \"Have her, keep her bro\" and he got really mad for no reason and thought I was being rude to him (which I wasnt). \n\nSo I simply left the group chat and talked to my girlfriend about the boundaries, and asked her to forward my messages to Muha which she did, and he reacted with \"👍\" and didn't say anything.\n\nSo I need some advice, should I tell my girlfriend hes a red flag and disrespectful, and advise her to leave him? Or ask her in a serious way about the boundaries and ask her to let me see her account to make sure everything between her and Muha is right. (She agreed to give me her account a few days before this but we both forgot and it never happened)", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/LivingProfessional59_666", "user": "u/LivingProfessional59", "text": "My boyfriend [22M] never compliments me [21F] and has been like this since the start of the relationship\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend doesn’t call me beautiful or compliment me at all. I have low self esteem so slowly it’s chipped away at my confidence. I was a woman who used to take loads of selfies, but now I don’t because I hate the way that I look. And I’ve felt like this for 3 months now. Him and I have been together since this May and we’re in a long distance relationship (uk to Australia). \n\nI’m not a happy person anymore. I do have clinical depression which is managed under medication but my symptoms seem to be getting more pronounced and severe. I’m not smiling anymore and I feel more apathetic towards everything. \n\n\nFor example during sex he doesn’t like bodily fluids. During sex, he doesn’t try and arouse me. He just focuses on his own pleasure. When I asked him to try and get me off he said he doesn’t like bodily fluids. And washed his hands immediately. When we’re also on video call, sometimes I get naked, after he finishes he told me once to get dressed straight after. I told him does he know what after care is? Because when he said that it made me feel uncomfortable, cheap and unloved. \nDuring sex he asks me to put my hair down because it turns him on more when I do that but I told him no since my hair normally is very dry thick and coarse and gets matted very easily so it doesn’t look nice when you bring it down. \n \nHe never compliments me. I always have to ask for a compliment. He asked me did my previous boyfriend for example give me a lot of validation. I said yes. And he said I need to be more confident but I already have low self esteem after years of bullying through secondary school and sixth form. \n\nI have some sexual kinks. He called it dark and twisted and said that it’s not normal to have kinks like that. Since then I’ve never showed him what kinks I’m into. Also for about 2 months now I’ve felt uncomfortable watching porn with my kinks in it. So in that regards I haven’t watched porn for 2 months.\n\nThe reason for that is that for me watching porn made me imagine myself in the place of the girl, however my love for my boyfriend deepened significantly and I can’t see him ever performing the acts that I’m into in porn. I now believe it is dark and twisted too. I also haven’t masturbated in 3 weeks as well. \n\nPut too much makeup on and calls me vain \nHe says he prefers my natural face and my face with makeup on is too heavy. When I was on holiday with him, I was talking pictures of my outfit, he then called me vain and said I need to tone it down. I don’t take pictures anymore as much. When I went to see him in Sydney, we did some exploring, I would take tons of pics of him. He would ask if I wanted any pictures and I would refuse because I felt ugly because he doesn’t compliment me at all. \n\n\n\n\nBleaching skin \nI have started bleaching my skin since I’ve been with him, because I think I’m too dark. \n\nOne night he said he doesn’t see a future with me. We basically tried to imagine where we’d be in 5 years and I wasn’t in his world in 5 years. I felt angry that I travelled all the way to Sydney Australia to see him and then he would say that to me. He later said that I need to get over it. \n\nHe told me he’s not sure if he sees a future with me even though I travelled all the way from the uk to Sydney to see him. \n\nAnyways to conclude at first being with him was magical. But going to uni, working and balancing a 9 hour time difference has proved to be a challenge. I don’t want to give up on our relationship, I’ve invested quite a lot now.

We are both in our 20’s now but we also met online through Xbox. We’re on different sides of the country though but we somehow always come back to each other. We’ve dated on and off for years now, always something pulling us back together. \n\nBut back in 2023 we finally met in person and it was the greatest experience I’ve ever had with someone. I felt as if there were constant fireworks blowing up inside me with every little interaction, look, touch, talk, etc. right before we met I was wishing and hoping that we would end up together again, but I would take it seriously this time. Hell I was even considering just not flying back home and leaving everything back at home just to stay with her. \n\nAnyways, we go and do all the fun activities and go on amazing dates and she finally tells me that’s she’s always been in love with me, then it’s all just sparks going through my body and heart starts racing, butterflies in the stomach, everything. I truly believed she was my soulmate, I still do. The thing is, I started noticing she was one her phone a lot. I let my weakness get to me and I peaked at her phone and come to find out she was still texting her ex. But I didn’t care about it in the moment, I knew she was mine. She introduced me to her parents and brother and her elderly cat. Her dad seemed to really like me cause he offered me a drink and was really interested in what I wanted in life, same with her brother. \n\nIt also got to the point where I would cry by just admiring her. I’ve never done that with anyone in my life, i barely let my vulnerabilities show with anyone but I knew with her I could truly be myself. I truly loved her. \n\nBut after coming back home I couldn’t get the thought of her talking to her ex while I was away since he lived so much closer than I did. So my obsession and jealousy had a grip on me and I know that’s what ruined things. I could tell it was upsetting her when I would bring it up but I was so stuck with that thought of losing her, I didn’t see myself being the reason she leaves. \n\nI go on a trip to Colorado with a few of my friends and I’m getting less and less contact from her and finally towards the end of my trip she ends things with me. It absolutely devastated me. Eyes were so swollen and red and stomach constantly yelling at me just because I would not eat. I remember passing out on the floor a couple of times from breaking down. \n\nWell I gave it 6 months till I tried talking to someone else again but I never got that same feeling that I did with her. So it really drove me away from those people. I constantly tried to compare them to her. I still kept contacts with her of course and I don’t think that was helping. I only wanted her back. So I stopped looking for someone else and didn’t date for a year and a half, I was so love sick I started convincing myself that if I better myself, she would come back to me. (God I sound so corny) but after talking to someone for a bit, we start dating and I tell her. \n\nFor more context, I wasn’t the best person in my youth and so I ghosted her a few times due to stress or jealousy or to just move on. So I completely understand her reasoning. She then blocks me on everything. I felt my heart drop and everything in my life go grey. I immediately broke things off with the person I was talking to, because they weren’t her and I didn’t want to put that on her. I could tell I didn’t have any interest in them or wanting to make any progress to. I’m still madly in love with her and I don’t think I’ll ever get over her.

Everytime I see someone with the same hair color as her, or her name, or her favorite snacks, or music or even the little things we did when I went to her. I don’t know what to do. I only wish we are pulled back to each other and do it right. Cause I know she’s the right person and my right place. But it’s never the right time. I’m ready for her.

{"id": "u/Confident_Talk7574_31", "user": "u/Confident_Talk7574", "text": "[23F, 25M] Im looking for other perspectives, am I love blind\n\nThis is going to be a lot fyi. Kinda starting from the beginning so hopefully people understand my pov. \n\nI(23F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for nearly a year and we are long distance. He’s here in the US from Denmark on a scholarship for a school in west va and I live in va. I don’t know if I’m overthinking things, and I’m looking for some advice. We met off of tinder. Our relationship progressed pretty quickly and within 2-3 weeks I asked for us to be exclusive and he agreed and we made it official. My last relationship was 4 years and even got engaged. It was my first serious relationship and it was horrible, non stop arguments, always being mistreated, manipulated, and controlled. I was naive and thought it was normal to go through\n\nMy current boyfriend treats me better than I could have ever asked for or imagined. He doesn’t kiss the ground I walk on, but that isn’t something I want. I want an equal, not someone with an obsession. He’s done a lot for me without even realizing it and I have really come to love him. Not the ideas of him but his actions. He isn’t a super expressive person but I know he does his best for me. Hes been a gentle kind of love and I treasure it. I’m not even sure that I want kids or even marriage. But a small part of me wants that with him even though I don’t necessarily want it for myself. \n\nNow, onto what I’m unsure of.\n\nI know most of my feelings and wants and where I see this relationship possibly heading. I don’t know his. I’m trying to get into university in Denmark to get a business degree. He’s getting his in computer science. I would want us to maybe live together, maybe get another dog. Go on trips, and be with each other in a simple way. He hasn’t thought farther than his next football game coming up as far as I know. He doesn’t know whether he’s going to get a full time job or pursue football (his scholarship) he doesn’t know if he wants kids or marriage (no hate there since I’m on the same boat) like I have these wants for what a future with him can be and what I’d be willing to do to make it happen. And i don’t think he thinks like that. So I stress about knowing exactly how he feels. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago when I was visiting him at the school in West VA. I saw he had updated his tinder account. Little back story with this. We met on tinder, we both uninstalled but never deleted our accounts. I reinstalled it that day to see what day we started talking because I was randomly curious. His account pictures were changed and so was his bio. Wasn’t any big change. Just a video of him and his friend together and he’s in a frat so he had their name put in his bio. He was out for practice when I found it, when he got back I asked him if he could please sit down. I showed him what I found and he had no real explanation. I asked him why, he said he doesn’t know why he did it and he made a mistake. Of course there were more things said and asked but I’m going off of what I can generally remember. I asked him if I could go through his phone and I went through it all right in front of him. He had no messages or anything but old ones from before me on tinder, no hinge or any other dating apps. Nothing on messenger with his (girl) friends or friends back in Denmark , he speaks danish and I’m learning so I google translated portions. I went through his texts, calls, and photos. Even made sure to check the recently deleted. I went through all of it and I hated it. That I was having to invade his privacy because he affected my trust in him.  But, I found nothing that showed he actually cheated. \n\nI got really frustrated, all my unanswered questions and doubts came out one after another. I told him “I’ve made it clear how I feel and where I see this relationship heading in the future and what I want with you and you haven’t, I need to know. Are you serious about this? I’m not playing games and “seeing where this takes me” I know that I love you and I want to be with you. Make it clear to me, we’re both adults, stop pussy footing around it” and he did he said that he wants me and loves me. That I’ve made him happier, he said he was serious. I told him to come forward with anything and now was his one and only chance. He said he never cheated. He hugged me and apologized, he said he knew he was an asshole. That there were the times when we hadn’t seen eachother for 2-3 months and he wanted physical sex but he never went out and got it and he was faithful. He fully owned up to making a mistake. I mean it felt and seemed genuine, unless hes the best actor. He didn’t cry or beg for forgiveness or apologize profusely like a little wimp. He owned up, he apologized, and he answered any questions I had. We talked about it the night of and we talked more the next day once I really thought about things. We’ve been perfect, and honestly better since then.\n\nOn a side note, we’ve never really argued or had issues within our relationship. We’ve always communicated effectively. Even with this situation it was handled well.\n\nBut on my end I’m kind of having an internal battle of wondering if I love this man more than he will ever love me. Or if he’s just truly not expressive and doesn’t know how to show his feelings. And if I’m letting my feelings for him cover the fact that he kind of cheated🤷‍♀️\n\nFound out the night I confronted him that his (girl) friends back home in Denmark, he’s had sex with just about all of them in the past. And that he hung out and texts his last “situationship” back at home, they’ve been friends and have known eachother from school. There’s nothing sexual as far as I know. His messenger texts with his friends I translated, initially I didn’t read all of them. I feel horrible for this but he has a pc. And he’s logged into messenger off of it. So the next day after I confronted him, I thoroughly went through everything. Google translated the entire chat. And he still doesn’t know I have access when I visit.  \n\nThis is what really hurts. He said to his friend who we will call Natalie (who he’s also slept with). A month or so before coming back to the US (he came back in August, I found his tinder profile 2 weeks after) that he was getting “pretty fucking tired” of me calling, and it being the same time everyday and that it’s started to stress him out. He never communicated this to me. Beforehand we even talked about what times I’d call him because of the time difference since he was back in Denmark at the time. It wasn’t an official meeting of course more or so I’ll call you and this time and then you call me when you’re done with whatever.\n It was the same times on my end because I was working two jobs. One full and one part time after. I’d wake up and 5am (his 11am) and we’d talk before I head into work. Then I’d call him on my way to my second job at 5:30 pm and say goodnight and blah blah. He never told me he had a problem with it. \n\nThen I read on his messenger texts from when he was on tinder and there’s this girl who we will call Soup that he seemed interested in. He said he thought she was cute, tried to match with her, she didn’t, and hes liked all her insta stories but she doesn’t respond etc.\n\nWhen I initially confronted him about the tinder profile he reassured me in all the ways possible. He was genuine. He told me he was so sorry for hurting me, that when there’s distance things with our relationship are so different and he made a mistake. Blah blah blah. When I’ve visited I’ve checked his messages with that one friend to see if he’s mentioned anything else about me or other girls and there’s been nothing since.\n\nHe’s done a lot to show his love for me. I’ve gone back to Denmark with him twice now, met all his family and some of his friends. \n\nI do all I really can to show someone I love them. For me love isn’t like that books, but a big part is sacrifice and compromise. Such as i drive 5 hours every other weekend to see him because hes not able to come to me. Or i let him have the last bite of cheesecake even if I want it. Or i would be willing to take my wants and dreams across the ocean to make a life with you possible, even if it doesnt end up working out. Running into this is really hard for me to understand how to make this mistake and be sorry. I feel as though he’s sorry for getting caught and also genuinely regrets what he did and truly cares and loves me, but I’m fighting myself on it because the thought of cheating or wanting someone else never crossed my mind\n\nI need other peoples opinions. There’s no one else I can talk to about this. I don’t want to leave him because I do love him, and he truly does make me happy. He’s made me want to be better and push farther. He’s my equal for me, he would be it if there’s an it. What do I do? Do I interrogate him? Come forward that I went through his stuff and found more, that I know more than what he’s lead onto?

We had a strong attraction, great chemistry, and some amazing moments together but there were also repeated arguments and patterns that left me unsettled.\n\nSome examples:\n\nWithin the first few weeks of dating she pulled me up on my messaging consistency, saying I messaged her differently on weekends and she found it “disrespectful”.\n\nI had travelled to another country for work and she started an argument because I didn’t messaged her as soon as I landed (I had poor signal, had to urgently catch a train and was planning on messaging her as soon as I had time). Again, she called it disrespectful and told me I’m not prioritising her.\n\nI reposted a female friends instagram story of me (it was just of me holding a drink) and she told me to take it down because if her friends followed me then they would be assuming that girl was my girlfriend. \n\nI jokingly called her a name which upset her, I apologies and then she kicked my feet in bed. When I asked her what she’s doing she told me it’s the only way for her to get back at me.\n\n\nI talked to her directly about these patterns of behaviours and how they made me feel. She told me her reactions were due to stress and that she’ll actively change. After a few weeks things went back to normal so I told her that our dynamic isn’t working. She pleaded with me not to end things, saying she’s “not normally like this” and I’d regret giving up on her. But in the end, I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next argument.\n\nI ended things last week. She seemed more accepting than I expected, even mature about it, but I can’t shake feelings of guilt. She clearly cared about me, and I did care about her. But I also feel relief now that it’s over, which tells me something too.\n\nMy question is: Did I do the right thing by ending this, or was I too sensitive/not giving enough grace for her stress?\n\nTL;DR: Dated for 4 months, strong chemistry but repeated conflicts (messaging frequency, Instagram post, not texting right after landing, even kicked me in bed after a joke).

We both were fresh out of relationships and had not fully cut off our exes yet so it was clearly a messy situation. I also met him when he was sleeping around and just being that type of guy. He ended things with all of that in mind and 2 weeks later we ended up hanging out again and talked it through. He claimed I could trust him and gave me some excuse of why he ended it and didn’t feel he was ready to be a real boyfriend but now was willing to try.

The fact that he did it mid argument is crazy disrespectful to me and that he lied about it for this long.

We were super close in the beginning, so in love and always having fun. I moved into his mom’s and was working night shifts at a local grocery store. At the time, he had no job and would stay up every night gaming till I got back home. For awhile it was fine, I enjoyed having him to come back to. But then it got bad due to the fact I was spending all the money on groceries and necessities. I was ok with it though and brushed it off because I figured it was just situational. eventually, he had a fight with his mom and we moved into my parents house. I got him a job at my job which was now a smoothie store. Fast forward, still pretty broke, and I still bought the important stuff. I ended up having beef with the owners and quit. He quit too. So then I found a new job, and he was jobless. Eventually my parents got pissed. They required us to pay rent and said if he didn’t get a job he couldn’t live there anymore. They could see my pain. During all of this, he was addicted to weed and had CHS. Eventually I told him, for our relationship I needed him to quit. He was sick, and forgetful, and unmotivated. He did. It took awhile and I had to constantly remind him why he was doing it but he did it. Then he got a job. Still, constantly broke because he was spending all his money on gas and rent, I took care of us. Now, we are living in my parents basement and he has changed a lot for the better. But, I’ve realized, we haven’t been intimate in months. And when he tries my body shuts off and I get angry and grossed out. I think it’s due to the neglect. Not to mention he has emotional trauma so when I cry and express my feelings to him he shuts down and is extremely quiet. He is in therapy now, and has changed a lot. But I still don’t feel physically attracted to him. I miss having sex, and cuddling and feeling close. But due to the lack of emotional connection, and feeling like the man in the relationship constantly caring for him and his needs, I have lost the desire to make love with him. I want it back, and he tries to be more caring and emotionally there for me. But it doesn’t work. I still don’t feel anything. I thought after him showing he changed it would slowly come back. So now I feel extremely bad because I am thinking of sex but not with him, and feeling angry at him a lot of the time. It’s like resentment.

We’ve been together for 3 years, and for the last 2 years we’ve been long-distance.\n\nWe met in early 2022 at a wedding, got close through mutual friends, and started dating that June. Things moved fast — we were deeply in love and spent most of our time together. By December we even introduced each other to our families, and everyone loved us. My dad even joked I had to marry her.\n\nThen, in January 2023, she told me she had been accepted to a university in Canada. I was completely shocked. She had once mentioned that living in Canada was her “dream,” but I had no idea she was actually applying. I’ve always said I would never do long distance again, so I felt blindsided and betrayed.\n\nWe fought for weeks. Later, I discovered she had also already received a **5-year visa**, and her family thought I had known all along. It crushed me that she was planning such a huge move in secret while we were building a future together.\n\nShe broke down crying, admitted she was wrong, and said she only kept it secret because she feared I’d leave her. She promised she would just study for one year and come back for me. Eventually, I forgave her and said I’d try. She swore there would be no more secrets.\n\nShe left for Canada a month later. Because of her immigration situation, if she leaves Canada she can’t return, so she hasn’t been able to visit. Meanwhile, I’m still in South Africa — my visa renewal is delayed, and I haven’t had luck finding overseas sponsorship jobs as a software developer.\n\nIt’s now been 2 years.

I want to stay with him.\n\n\nHi. i’m writing this post because yesterday I found out my boyfriend was flirting with a girl behind my back. he reassured me so many times that he wasn’t but i found out that he was flirtaciously bantering with another girl and calling her cute and sexy. \n\nI know a lot of people will tell me that i should leave him probably but i’m choosing to stay with him. we’ve been together for 7 months and were talking for about a 6 months. we’re long distance- we met online and we met 3 times since dating. he surprised me on my birthday despite him being broke. \n\nwhen we first met we were both jobless and depressed. for the most part, we’ve helped and encouraged eachother to be the best people we could be. we had A LOT of ups and downs but we were getting through that. Even though we helped eachother with some things- there are still a lot of unresolved issues with my boyfriend and i suppose it lead to him unconsciouslly flirting with another girl. \n\nI read that someone can love their partner so much but still end up cheating. sometimes it’s need for validation or things like unresolved problems. \n\nWhen i found out that he was flirting with another girl i broke up with him. it didn’t last long though. i yelled at him, i was mean to him and he just took it cause he knew what he did wrong. I didn’t want to throw away what we had worked hard to build- our relationship, the understandings we had of eachother and the secrets we only know aboht eachother. He’s the first person i’ve ever opened up to - thus allowing him to help me with the traumas that led my life. \n\nI decided to talk to him about it after a few hours and he said he doesn’t know why he did that. it went over his head. he didn’t send or receieve photos- they didn’t talk about sex or anything but he reffered to a photo she sent from their past and called it sexy. it hurts to know he did this. he says he doesn’t know why he did this. He is a good guy but sometimes he’s just too nice. too friendly. he doesn’t know how to set boundaries - which is what led him to do this. \n\nhe’s expressed his regret and is always apologizing. i understand that he didn’t know what he was doing and that a part of him just doesn’t care about a lot of things so when he did this- he wasn’t really thinking. he struggles with a part of him that just doesn’t care about anything sometimes- even though he cares aboht me- hes just mindless. i do/did hold that against him, though. He apologies and says hes gonna try to figure out that part of him he doesn’t understand and that he’s going to try to get therapy. i’m going to help him find a therapist- he doesn’t know how to but i know where to look, generally. \n\nI understand his regret and guilt and apologies. i understand unresolved trauma may have caused this but it doesn’t change that fact that i feel like i’ve been cheated and betrayed. i have trust issues and he is well-aware of this. he reassured me and we had many fights because of my overthinking. i was just starting to trust him until he pulled this. it feels like a year of progress to fully start trusting him has been washed down the drain. as if all my efforts to do better were nothing. i used to think i was the one who had a lot of things to work on but here he is- pulling this crap. \n\nit only happened yesterday. We hangout and then randomly i think about this and i start talking about how sad and hurt i am. he apologizes but then i start talking more and more on how he hurt me and i just get angry and i say petty stuff and he gets sad. he just listens, though and takes it. he says he just takes it cause he knows he did wrong. he says he’s lucky that i even stayed and that he will show me and do better. \n\ni want to be with him but how do we get past this? I don’t want us to break because we are both sad. how do we get through this? I don’t really know what to do.

With our circumstances we're currently only able to see each other every two weekends, sometimes less frequently. \n\nOnce we became official she was fairly honest with the fact that me watching porn while in this relationship made her very sad and made her feel like she's \"not enough\". I felt and still do feel that there was a strong disconnect or difference in regards to how each of us view porn, but regardless I told her that I would stop watching it because I hated to see her upset and wanted to make her feel safer. \n\nThat was almost a month ago now and I've found it quite difficult lately to resist the urge to use porn. I, for reference, have quite a high sex drive and when we're together we usually have sex at least once a day which she's happy with, and I don't think is that unusual considering our age and the fact that we usually haven't seen each other for weeks and only have one or two days with each other. I don't feel that that gets in the way of our time spent together either as we almost always get out of the house and do some more active things like walks, go shopping, dates etc. \n\nIn line with that, prior to this relationship I would generally masturbate most days but with some points where I wouldn't feel the desire to do it at all for a week or multiple weeks, and then the other way round when I would want to do it more often than usual. I figured that was in line with just general fluctuations in hormonal activity but I'm no doctor, so I've also considered the possibility that it could be an addiction. I didn't feel that that was it exactly as it doesn't get in the way of our sex life at all when we're actually together. I'm fully satisfied with spending my time with just her and my porn use doesn't lessen my desire for her, actually quite the opposite. \n\nAs time goes on and we continue to spend weeks apart, I feel a not-constant but frequent-enough desire to use porn once again since I can't be with her. She did let me take some pictures of her after some convincing (she was shy/embarrassed) so that I could use them instead of porn, which I have a number of times, but I feel a photo kind of starts to lose it's magic if you look at it for too long, in contrast to the real person where that is the source if that makes sense. \nI've also used my imagination as she suggested which works sometimes, but I still feel that these alternatives don't satisfy me, as I believe myself and from what I've researched, most men, derive a higher portion of their sexual satisfaction visually in comparison to women (once again not that I think she's visually unsatisfactory, she's beautiful, just that the alternatives don't stack up).\n\nThis has never affected my ability to perform for or satisfy my partner so besides the fact that it upsets her personally, I don't know if it's actually bad for me to do.\n\nI've seen so much contradicting information on this topic, and I don't know if this is unhealthy of me to feel this way, if it's something that she maybe needs to work on, or if it's genuinely an incompatibility between the two of us for which one of us needs to make a change in order to fix. \n\nTLDR - In a long distance relationship and me watching porn deeply upsets my girlfriend. I still feel the desire to watch it when we are apart.

Lately she has been with friends and barely texts me on vacation (which is normal). I understand she is the driver so I told her she should only text when available and try to rest (It's okay to catch up at night). However, she only sends me photos and gives me microscopic details like \"I'm going showering. Just got out, we went to the beach.\" and when I ask for something deeper she either doesn't respond for hours, or she will say something to shut down the conversation immediately. Whenever I ask a question or try to talk, she either replies surface level or ignores me for 2-3 hours, watching my instagram stories, and then making posts (but not messaging me directly to talk or ask about me). Her friends all know she is with me, so it's hurtful when communication has to change and she treats me differently around other people. There's no \"I love you\" except for bedtime and no words of affection or flirting almost like I really don't even exist. (Whereas when I see my friends or have events, I always message her and make sure I tell her I miss her, I wished she was with me)\n\nI have tried to maintain normal conversation and ask her about her day, how she is, but she barely answers any questions. When I have commented on her outfits and called her beautiful she has also ignored this and simply said what she was doing. Now, she has turned to posting stories with cryptic messages. From a song about \"Being A Fool\" in love, missing chances, to another song about \"Words\" where the singer says they can't express their love through words, but you need to believe it through their song. I tried to ask her if she was okay, since she's been silent. She told me she's fine and was at the beach. I said her communication seemed a little different and asked if she was sure, she then asked me \"What do you expect anyway?\" and proceeded to talk about how she's going to eat now. I apologized and said I didn't know it was the wrong time for talking. She thanked me and left it at that.\n\nShe messaged me two hours later to tell me she's going showering. I asked about her plans and she told me she's going to go spend her evening with her female friends watching the sun. I felt heartbroken because to me this is an activity I would do with my partner. When we meet up in person she never plans anything romantic, it's always physical. When we did have a chance to go on a boat I tried to talk to her, but she was on her phone. I asked if she had any questions for me, she said she already knew me and \"Ruined\" the romantic evening by texting her friends 24/7 then taking photos. I asked her to dance with me but she refused. (This hurt me because she sings and dances with friends, but when I asked her in public, she refused. I had to dance with someone else when I got called up. Everything made me feel lonely. I felt like a stranger in her country.\n\nNow, she's on vacation, so I didn't tell her the sunset viewing bothered me, I simply.. wished her and her friends a good time. But a part of me hurt me. I don't want to be controlling or tell someone what they should/shouldn't do - but I also feel she should understand that the LDR is hard for me, I want to talk to my person, not feel like a complete stranger or last priority. She doesn't need to update me every two or three hours, she could just talk to me properly in the evening rather than shutting me out completely or giving surface level responses.\n\nAIO or am I right to feel neglected/unloved during such situations?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She swears nothing happened, as they both realized that it's a mistake and he then slept on the couch. However, this is not the story I initially heard, but what she told me this year. At first, it was more like \"he just sent me home and then left\". Now, I don't consider myself stupid and, honestly, I don't think I've heard everything. However, this was \\~10y ago and I don't think I really care anymore if anything happened. I am, however, a bit devastated to have found out I've been lied to all this time. We broke up for a bit, but got back together due to me being in a dark place and naive (I know, I know...).\n\nWe've had issues with physical closeness (sex as well, but not just that) for over 6y now. I've tried talking about it and seeing what I could do and/or change from my side. She has listened and seemingly cared, but nothing has changed. I'm definitely no expert, but it has felt like she could be asexual, since she has been completely fine with going multiple months without any sex.\n\nWe had planned for kids years in advance and when the time finally came, I told her that I don't think it's a good idea due to us having issues with physical closeness and this is something I need. Promises to change, yada yada... Voila, we now have 2 amazing children and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nWith the added stress of raising kids, whenever I've brought this topic up again, she has told me that it's hard for her after having kids. I feel I understand that as much as I can, and I've been patient. I'm an active dad and she has told me that she appreciates how much I play with and care for our kids. Of course I haven't been perfect either and I feel I could've given her even more time away from the kids. But, this isn't a new issue, since it was present long before we even had kids.\n\nThe last few years have been very stressful due to buying a house and decorating it, as well as doing **a lot** of work in the garden, all while raising 2 small kids. Now that the kids have grown up just a bit and go to kindergarten, I've discovered myself thinking about what I want. I don't feel happy and have doubts whether I truly can be happy in this marriage anymore... I feel like I've been the one holding us together and that I've been the \"comfortable\" choice. I feel I've been sort of neglected for a long time now, even though I've openly and calmly expressed my feelings and needs. Still, nothing has changed... Until now.\n\nMy wife noticed I've been \"off\" lately - more quiet, serious and sad. I told her that I don't think I've been happy in this relationship for years now and am thinking whether I want to continue. She was, of course, very sad to hear about this, and started asking about what's wrong. I told her the same that I've written here, and then some, and I've seen real change in her. She's suddenly very touchy-feely and initiates sex daily. However, I feel a bit indifferent about all of this... Why just now? Why not when I tried different ways and words to talk about this for years? However, after a few weeks I felt myself opening up a bit again.\n\nI had a feeling she might tell some of her friends about this situation, so I gave in and snooped a bit (yes, we have access to eachothers devices. And yes, I know it's wrong, but that's a separate topic). I saw a group chat with 2 of her girlfriends, where she didn't have one positive thing to say about me. All of this hurt me deeply, because **I know** that I'm not the person she made me out to be. I talked about this with her and asked why she felt the need to picture me in that light. She replied that she was looking for comfort and the best way she knew how to get that was to talk negatively. I understand that people often love drama and gossip, but this is your partner and the father of your children... This situation made my doubts even worse.\n\nI've been reading books and others' stories online. I've also been talking to a therapist and my dad about all of this. I would **love** to hear other peoples stories about similar situations.\n\nMy dad is divorced and now living with a new woman - said he's happy now. This was very good to hear, because he told me he hadn't felt happy for the last 16 years of his marriage with my mom (most of their marriage). He told me this about his marriage (rough translation): \"Once a soup has gone bad, you can heat it up again, but that won't make it good\". The difficult thing for me is, I can't be sure any decision I make is the right one. My dad also told me that I won't know until I find out. I feel this is a tough thing to \"find out\", as it's a life-changing decision, but I do agree with him.\n\nThankfully, we're both doing well in our careers: she makes \\~2x the average salary in our country, while I make \\~3x. What makes it harder is that I would never give up my kids, so anything less than 50/50 is not even an option for me, but she has told me that she couldn't do 50/50 as that's not enough for her. She also added that she doesn't feel like she would want to even get along with me if we were to divorce, and I feel that would devastate our kids (if not now, then later). I've always thought \"all relationships have problems\" and while I feel that's true, I still think I should feel happy...\n\nAm I just burnt out? Am I just looking for something new?\n\nOr am I truly feeling that this is not right? If so, is it worth throwing away everything we've built?\n\nOr should I try to fix everything again and risk feeling the same way sometime later in my life? I just don't want to ever say that I've been unhappy for 16 years, because hearing my dad say that broke my heart...", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

For some context, we met online about 15 years ago and we started chatting. We were actually not that far from each other, same country different cities, but since we were teenagers( 17 close to 18) , it wasn't easy to meet regularly. We were together for about 2 years and during that time we met 3 times. \n\nAt first everything was great but after a few weeks he started changing... He started posting about other girls all the time, how he wanted more girls to talk with, how pretty he find them and how it was easy to get a second girlfriend because his actual girlfriend ( me ) was in a different city and couldn't check what he is doing... He will always tell me that i wasn't pretty enough and how easy it was for him to get any girl he wanted... he will yell at me even for the smallest things, ghost me for hours and even talk bad about me to other girls... and I know it's my fault for staying even though I knew what he was doing but I was young, I had no friends and didn't know any better... \n\nHe ended up cheating on me with one of the girls he hang out with and he even posted about her before we even broke up... \n\nI'm not gonna lie, he broke me. Like actually broke my heart into so many pieces, it was so hard to trust someone else again...He made me extremely insecure and feel like I wasn't enough. \n\nFast forward to now aka 3 months ago, we accidentally met in my city and tbh I didn't even realize it was him at first. Talking with him again casually was actually nice, like all those things from the past never happened.\n\nWe ended up exchanging numbers and talked from time to time. He moved to my city for work recently and he didn't know anyone except from me.\n\nLast month he sent me a text apologizing for what he did, for treating me that way and for being a terrible boyfriend. He explained some things to me about back then and told me that I was the only girl that was actually kind to him.\nI honestly didn't except it at all and his apology felt genuine. I actually didn't think much about it but what triggered me was when he said he still has feelings for me... he asked if I could give him a chance to make things right... \n\nI haven't replied to him yet but ever since then the more he tries to talk to me the more i feel like everything he says its a lie... I keep thinking about what happened back then and it still breaks me...\n\nThe funny thing is, regardless of all that I still wish him well... even after all those years and all that pain, I'll still help him or be there for him... \n\nBut thinking about loving him or being with him feels like stabbing my heart... like I'm in hell and there is no escape\n\nPs.

When he told me he had a crush on that boy he said he “only liked him but didn’t love him the way he loved me”, we talked and I was upset but willing to work through it with him, mostly because of how devastated I was in the moment and how badly I didn’t want to lose him. He told me they only knew each other for a month but “he’s been sending me cute videos and I feel guilty for rejecting him” which honestly leads me to believe he was emotionally cheating on me, even now it still hurts so badly to think about it and I’ve been having reoccurring dreams of him leaving and cheating on me.\n\nI begged him to stay and not leave me for that boy until he turned it back onto me and said I couldn’t be what he needed, that I wasn’t bold enough and didn’t show him the love he wanted or needed, so we went on a “break” because in his words, “I don’t want to see him or you right now”. There’s too much to go over but eventually we got back together.\n\nFast-forward a month, he joined this minecraft game server where he was being flirted with. He invited me to the sever and I was annoyed with the flirting and didn’t like it so I told him, he said it was a joke and in his words again, “this is why I was afraid to invite you, because you take things too seriously. even things\nlike this, I want to be allowed to joke around too” so I let him, he’s russian and so are all his friends so I couldn’t understand what they were saying but I translated it and he was denying that we were together. I left the game after the flirting got too much and since he was ignoring me too, later a screenshot was shown to me of that conversation.\n\nHe urged me to leave the server and completely stop playing so I did and I can only assume the flirting continued but I told myself, “what I don’t know can’t hurt me” and kept living like that. Up until now, he barely texts me, I send him paragraphs about how much I love him, I send him cute videos, I try to be more “bold and brazen” like he wants me to, but nothing seems good enough for him and im\ntired. I invest too much effort into him and this relationship just to get basically nothing back, when actually does respond to something I send he’s dry and uninterested yet I see him posting in his telegram channel and playing with his friends meanwhile I have to beg for even an ounce of attention.\n\nI just need help I want us to work out.

We met in a hostel and hit it off immediately. The connection was rare — emotionally deep, physically strong, and just felt like we really got each other. We spent a few intense days together in Vienna, then kept in touch afterwards, speaking almost every day.\n\nNot long after, we started seeing each other in person again, despite living hours apart. Everything felt right — we opened up about our traumas, futures, hopes, and fears. She looked after me during a difficult moment when I broke down about my dad, and I felt I could be fully vulnerable around her — something I’ve never experienced before. We told each other we loved one another and it wasn’t just said lightly.\n\nBut as the time for her to go to university got closer, things changed. She became overwhelmed and emotionally distant. Eventually, she told me she couldn’t give me what I deserved and that the timing just wasn’t right. We had a really emotional phone call and I ended up driving 5 hours unannounced to see her, not to win her back, but to say everything I needed to say in person. She was happy to see me — we had a lovely night, talked honestly, shared a moment of real connection (we even slept together again), and told each other “I love you.”\n\nAfter that, we agreed to stay in contact. We still speak every day, share little life updates, and talk about how much we miss each other. But it’s not quite the same — she’s clearly trying to emotionally distance herself. She’s said things like “I just want you,” or “I don’t want to find someone else,” but then also says she shouldn’t call me or get too close again. It feels like she’s trying to force a disconnect, even when she doesn’t really want to.\n\nI’m trying to respect her space and not hang onto false hope, but deep down I do believe that what we had was rare and that if life brings us back together at a better time, we could have something real. I’m working on myself — going to therapy, focusing on personal growth, and not just waiting around — but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want us to try again in the future.\n\nSo Reddit, do you think this could be a case of right person, wrong time?

For some context, my GF (22F, lets call her Luz) and I (24m) met in college, I was finishing my law degree and she was finishing her bachelors. After dating for a year, we moved in together for my last year at law school until I graduated and moved back with my parents, a 9hr drive away.

This was clearly explained when I got the job. Luz and I are both west coast, so anywhere I move to will be at least 2 hours ahead. That means that by the time she comes home from class, spends time with her family, and rests, it'll be 8 PM for her and 10 or 11PM for me. I need to be asleep by then, so we won't have any time together for basically the whole week. We haven't discussed it yet, but I'm really worried about what this means for our relationship, especially because she still has at least 3 years of school left.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a similar situation?

(22F) Me and my (21M) boyfriend met at the beginning of 2023 after I had moved from my hometown to a completely new city, we talked for a few months and then bam we were dating pretty quickly. I would say maybe about four months after getting to know each other. Our relationship has been amazing. He is one of the most perfect people that I’ve ever met. We have such like goals and ideals, and we constantly talked about what our futures wanted to look like And how we wanted to grow as individuals in our careers and what we wanted from our relationship. The first year had been great. We did have some issues with my family and some other things simply because he is all allergic to cats and my family has cats so it’s made it pretty hard to have a well-rounded family relationship with him, but overall, we have worked through a ton of hurdles to be where we are today.\n\nIn the summer of 2024 I started my nursing program and everything had been doing really really well up until this past summer where I started to get really stressed, I was so mentally checked out. And I was really just focusing on getting through school one day at a time, he supported me very well through this and now with my schooling coming to an end we have started to have a few issues. The past month or so I was going through a lot and our sex life and intimacy has has kind of come to a decline. I do know that it is my fault because I’ve been the one pushing him away and we’ve had discussions about how it’s made him feel. I told him that I really just thought it was stress and the new birth control that I had gotten on and that it was really messing with my sex drive. I told him that I would fix it but have been waiting on an appointment to get things resolved. During this time, he has been trying to convince me to move into his apartment, which that has been really difficult because I didn’t wanna hurt my family‘s feelings since they have been really hesitant on the issue and I was trying not to upset either party.( my family is kinda strict when it comes to things like that due to how they were raised about certain things not happening before marriage) I’ve been slowly moving into his apartment and I thought things were going really great until earlier this week when he wanted to have a sit down conversation with me. He decided to tell me that for the past few months, he has started to resent me for the fact that we have had lack of intimacy. And that because of my stress level, and the things that I have going on, he has been putting his own goals and priorities to the side, which I feel really really weird about because he has never once brought that up to me before he also told me that he thinks that I’ve changed since the beginning of our relationship and I understand what he means by that simply because I used to be a very, very active person but because of school, I did have to put some of those things aside.\n\nWhen we had this discussion, I told him that he was right and that I would work on getting back into my old lifestyle now that things were getting better with school and I left like I could get back to myself. Things would definitely take a turn because I would have more time for him in therefore I would be able to support him now that he no longer has to support me when it comes to school and stress he agreed that he would be patient and that we could work through this, but then the very next day he did a total 180 and told me that he would like to go on a break. And I don’t mean just like a regular break he means a whole one month no contact break because he needs to work out his feelings and put himself first and he believes that I have made it to where there’s no room for him left in my life, which has never been the case.\n\nTL; DR- After almost three years of being together he asked for a break to rethink our relationship and his feelings about his place in my life along with his own goals after we made such a big decision to live together.\n\nHow do I respect his wishes but also try to keep our relationship alive?

I’ve already helped him financially multiple times, including paying off his credit card debt before we got the house.\nI’m not strict or controlling about money. I don’t ask to manage his income or tell him what to do. I only ask that he takes care of his share of the house expenses. I’ve been covering groceries and most daily needs on my own. But even with that setup, he’s still unable to manage his money well, and now I’ve noticed he’s accumulating credit card debt again.\n\nWhat worries me is that he’s aware of his financial limitations, but still continues to make unnecessary purchases. For example, just today, I transferred money to his account to make sure his automatic payments don’t bounce, but he spent part of it right away for a motor ride.\n\nI’ve tried bringing this up calmly and respectfully, but it often turns into me feeling like I’m being too hard on him. That’s not my intention. I don’t want him to feel like a failure or a burden. I love him and want to support him. But I also need to feel supported in return. I’m starting to feel more like I’m carrying this relationship financially, and that’s becoming hard to ignore.\n\nWe’ve been planning to have a baby soon, but I’m honestly scared that if things don’t change, I’ll end up handling all of the baby’s needs financially, too.\n\nI don’t want this to become a bigger problem in the future.

I was extremely embarrassed and abruptly broke up with her the next day. I am still heartbroken, and regretting not giving her another chance to try to fix her behavior. I grew up around a few alcoholics and after that day I saw her going down that path.

For purposes of this Reddit post I’ll call him Josh. His long term best friend, I’ll call him Ryan, we have both know for many years. Josh has known him for almost ten and I have known him for 7. We were actually introduced to each other through Ryan. At the time we were introduced, Ryan and I were deep in a situationship. We have always had an on again, off again connection since we have met.\n\nAround 2 month after I met Josh, Ryan got back with his ex girlfriend and things between us were ended immediately. To stress, I was 19 years old at the time, and as an attempt to hurt Ryan, I started seeing Josh. I actually fell completely in love with Josh, we are literally a match made in heaven, we complete and compliment each other so perfectly. I do still love Josh.\n\nWe both cut contact with Ryan almost two years ago as a lot of stuff about our relationship got out that he had previously kept from his girlfriend and she felt it was best none of us had any contact anymore, and so we haven’t.\n\nWe share a mutual circle of friends, and while Josh and Ryan are still friends they are no where near as close as they were. Ryan had tried everything in his power to convince me not to be with Josh at the beginning and this really took a toll on their friendship.\n\nSince we share a group of friends, we find ourselves running into eachother at bars and clubs. Anytime I see Ryan, we don’t even have to speak, it will send me into a spiral. These spirals can last weeks. I will do nothing but sit with regret, and think of him constantly.\n\nI have recently found myself having really intense feelings surround Ryan. I miss him incredibly, he was my best friend at a point and I have not found such a strong connection with anyone else. Friend or relationship.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point now that I struggle to be around Josh. I am snappy, mean spirited and outright horrible to him when we are together. I find myself aggravated by his presence and just want to be by myself. Anytime I am with him I am constantly thinking about Ryan.\n\nBut, since we have a child together, and I do still have feelings of love for Josh, do I just stay with him? I know that I will never feel the way I do for Ryan with anyone else, so do I just settle for what’s comfortable? Especially since we have a baby. I know that there is no chance for Ryan and I, he is still with his girlfriend and we haven’t had a conversation since we stopped contact. But is it fair to stay with Josh when I still have such intense feelings for Ryan? Even when I know that these feelings will probably never fade, no matter who I am with? And I do love Josh, he just isn’t Ryan. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR. Have a baby with Josh, constantly thinking about Ryan although we haven’t been in contact for 2 years.

I wanted to slow down but he said he knew what he wanted and that by me saying I wanted to slow down it meant I wasn’t taking him serious but I was so we kept being “together”. A lot of the things he had done/said looking back now I was so naive. I thought maybe this is how relationships are, learning to accommodate one another and to take their words into consideration.

Hes my first boyfriend and I lost my virginity to him and I was dumb enough to have sex with him on our first date. I’ve been on dates with other guys I didn’t have sex with them but when I went on a date with my bf he was so different. I knew I wanted to be with him. Through out 2023 he accused me of having sex with my stepdad just because I don’t have that good of a relationship with my mom. He accused me of cheating, he would go through my phone, he had my location but I couldn’t have his, he accused me of being too mysterious, I’ve been so patient and explaining to him what your accusing me of is not true. How can I prove something that never happened? How much more do I have to explain myself??\n\nfast foward, 2024, I found out he’s been cheating. Lol what a surprise I know. Looking back I should’ve known. I was so heartbroken, I think I still am. I’ve never felt this way before. I also found out I was pregnant and had gotten herpes type 1 and 2. I felt my world shatter that day. The whole 2024 we argued so much I had so many things to say and questions I wanted answered, some were truthful and some were lies. He kept talking to multiple women. Got on dating apps. But still told me he loved me and that they mean nothing. I cried every month that year. We got into a really bad fight at the bar the cops came and people recorded us. We still ended up together.\n\nEntering 2025 he kept talking to the same girls again and new people. meeting up but no sex. He says he only talks to other people to use them not to replace me. I went through his phone and found messages from 2020 that show he’s been fucking around with the same people for YEARS. It sounds horrible and you’re probably wondering why I’m still here. Aside from his cheating behavior and anger he’s the sweetest. I see him try so hard to show me he loves me by doing things he knows mean something to me.

I see no point in meeting new people when other guys  are gonna do me worse or still do me wrong one way or another. If I do date other people how do I even bring up I have herpes? I feel like I have no way out but to be here and try to work through it. Right now we aren’t talking because I didn’t have enough money to buy him a Gatorade so I said no you can’t get a drink so he took the one I bought and drank almost all of it and saved me like 3 gulps.

We have had no issues apart from when we went on his phone, it seemed like he was talking to another girl.\n\nWe have been dating for a few months now and he has even asked me if we could be exclusive. Of course I agreed and we both mutually understood that this was going to become a relationship. However, everytime my phone gets a notification, he is always the first one to check it and see who sent me a message. So to ease his mind, we went through my phone and I showed him that there is nothing to worry about because I’m not talking to other men.\n\nHowever, it did make me curious. It almost felt like he was projecting and maybe he’s the one that’s being disloyal. So whilst we were on his Instagram, just looking at random videos. He swiped off and I saw that he was messaging this girl. \n\nThe messages were very friendly, however it felt like they were speaking as if they were in the beginning of a talking stage. He was super enthusiastic whilst speaking to her and let’s say her name is Emily for instance, he’d message her multiple times like ‘emilyyyyyy’ ‘emillyyyyy’\n\nThe messages that I saw came off as flirty and in the beginning he claimed that he had no interest in her whatsoever, however after we went through them. He admitted it does seem flirty. \n\nI don’t mind the person I’m seeing to have friends of the opposite gender. However. They have only been friends for two months. They met up for coffee multiple times. But that was two months ago and I’m fine with it considering the fact that we never said we were exclusive during that time. \n\nMy main issue is now, he is still messaging her. Just a week ago, she sent him a post of the club he had went to and I suppose they were talking about it. He then proceeded fo say that they should go together. \n\nWhen I confronted him about this, he said that he only said it to fill in the void of the conversation, claiming that he usually does this out of nothing to say. However that did not make sense, considering the fact that he had already sent her a message before he asked her to go to the club. He had double texted a few mins later. Therefore showing that there is no void to fill. \n\nI just feel really sad as I have done everything in my power to be faithful, I’ve blocked multiple guys who tried to talk to me.

I love meeting and talking to foreigners, and eventually we caught interest in one another. We have been talking for over a year and two months, and dating for 8 months. Our bond grew stronger and stronger. We match so well and truly enjoy talking, calling, and seeing each other. I know we love each other deeply, and even though both of us have had physical relationships, we have never felt a love so pure, sincere, and strong like this one. The problem is that, as in any LDR, the distance between us feels heavy (and particularly on us, it is huge: 10,500 km with a 9-hour difference). While it’s possible to meet in a country in between to make expenses manageable, and we are planning to do it, closing the gap could realistically take years, many years. All of this considering that at this point, our financial situation cannot really make us afford to see each other even once a year.  \n\nI often find myself worrying about the future, how we’ll ever be physically together, when it will happen, and whether we can handle the challenges of being apart.

Yet, I want to believe we can make it through this distance, and we will try. \n\nI share this here because I would really appreciate encouragement, perspective, or kind words from people who understand what it’s like to love someone from afar.

We got together in school due to mutual friends and she lives practically right next to me so we meet everyday for at least 2-3 hours and its very rare that we dont meet, at the start of our relationship my gf was having some issues due to her anxiety and it was a lot to handle for me because she had many panic attacks, sudden distrust in everyone and everything so it was a rocky ride at the start of our relationship but at that time i didnt mind helping her out through her problems ( i still dont but it has started taking its toll), but otherwise the relationship has been going pretty well, she has met almost all my family members and they all like her and her parents also trust me so theres nothing wrong there as well. \n\nHere are where the problems start:\nWe were at a party where i confessed to her about my feelings and she said she feels the same way as well, but during the same night she made out with me and my best friend and her excuse was she was too drunk to know what she was doing (she was she blacked out later) so idky but i was like fine happens. Due to this I dont like the way she behaves when she drinks even today because she feels drinking alcohol is a great excuse to do anything and everything ( i dont think she has cheated on me other than that instance). She acts like a child all the time like shes some 10 year old kid who constantly needs attention, we have had a conversation on how i dont give her the amount of attention she needs even though i make it a point to meet her everyday no matter what. Last year the day before birthday i was planning a surprise so i was in contact with her mom to plan everything and when i was talking to her mom she told me that she has gone to meet a friend lets call him jack, now when she left my place she told me she was going home and then when i texted her what are you doing she didnt reply for 30 mins and when she did she said she was with her mom. This Jack guy has been a source of friction in our relationship because he is a 24 yr old man now and they were friends before we started dating but Jack used to kiss her on her neck and she used to lie on top of him and shit.

Well in that conversation that she didn't know i witnessed, she mentioned to the friend she was talking to that she (the friend who stayed with us and she showed me the risqué pics of) started dating him 3 years before and was living with him ( the ex husband). She(my fiance)then said, and i quote \"yeah, it's been a rough 3 years\" referencing the fact that her friend was dating her ex husband. She has never mentioned this to me, nor did she mention it when showing me the pics, the day after his death. I feel like she's lying, keeping secrets. I feel a bit betrayed. I know it's not fair for me to be angry at her for her feelings, nor to make another's death about me. Yet, I can't help feeling hurt that she obviously still had strong enough feelings, not from his death so much, but to be upset by her friend dating him. I feel like she shouldn't care at all about who he dates, or what he does. The fact that she kept this from me is the worst part, to me at least. Am I being an asshole for feeling like this? I don't think so. I believe that she should be open with me, completely honest about her feelings and she should have talked to me about these things that so obviously bother her.

We have had a lot of struggles such as people getting involved and trying to tear us apart like our exes, my ex bf’s ex gf. It has been chaos and drama with him and others. We plan to see each other but I keep telling him to come see me first. I found out he bought a ticket to come see me. I was so happy so I took leave 11 - 19 October. He can change his dates for the flight. But he has said he wants to see me. He hasn’t told me if he has taken leave on the week of my holiday. I can’t afford to go because it is too soon and too expensive. So I am not certain he will come to meet me on my holiday week. I am just worried about our future. He has his mortgage to pay so he can’t just leave and be with me. I mentioned he can do a work holiday visa or student. But he can’t sell his house because of his mortgage. And I can’t leave because I have to pay my car loan which doesn’t end until 23 August 2027. So all we can do is text and call each other which we haven’t done in a while. And try to see each other when we have the time and money. Is it worth sticking it out or should I move on? I thought I could do it but it is hard. I am already struggling to pay bills and my manager is mean to me and puts me down a lot I think because of my background and me being an introvert. I don’t know what to do.

Advice is appreciated\n\nWe started talking from June 2023, he emotionally cheated from June 2023 - May 2024.\n\nApparently his girl bestfriend enjoyed his attention so she led him on from March 2022 - May 2024. (He made me believe we were exclusive)\n\nI only got to know in April 2024 as he confessed that he and that girl stopped talking in February 2024, as he slowly started falling for me.\n\nI confronted this girl to know the truth, because girls support girls right? She was an old friend in 2017 so I thought that'll also rekindle an old friendship. Turns out this girl was two-faced. Instead of telling me the truth, and questioning him normally she did this \"testing\" and \"games\". Don't need such a friend, seems very malicious. She called him and asked him to date her instead, knowing the fact that we are dating, lied about me flirting with another guy, likely because for her ego she wanted to show that she can get him, but he blocked her. She said she did it to \"TEST HIS LOYALTY\", which is of course false.\n\nI gave this guy another chance which is yet again a bad move, disrespects every 2 weeks from June 2024 - June 2025. Trust eventually got better as he was at home alone with his mom, by May 2025 I trusted him completely, we were so happy together till July 2025. \n\nHe started masters in August 2025 and secretly made female friends without even being transparent. He should've told me immediately but he told me after 2-3 weeks. He went on trips with them. \n\nHe told me he will text the girls in his class and then show me a screenshot to prove that it's purely platonic. Why start text conversations with them if they didn't start conversations yet? I was angry and he blamed my reaction.\n\nDue to the secrecy and trust issues I couldn't be \"sweet\" to him, I was still responding like a friend would (not calling him babe or using heart emojis) but he blamed me for being nonchalant and cold. I am not someone who can fake it. Trust takes time to build and him expecting me to be sweet instantly is just so unfair to me. I can talk as friends, but not being lovey dovey when I myself feel unsafe and distrustful. This is a relationship where I am crying everyday. I am blamed for my emotions. \n\nNext steps? Worth staying, or will he cheat based on past patterns?\n\nTLDR: He (25M) emotionally cheated on me (25F) from June 2023–May 2024 with a girl best friend who manipulated both of us. I forgave him, but disrespect cycles continued until June 2025. Trust finally built back, but after he moved for his masters in Aug 2025, he hid new female friends, went on trips, and expects me to trust him instantly without giving it time, then blames me that I am distant. I feel unsafe, blamed for my reactions, and stuck crying daily in a relationship where my emotions are invalidated.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

When we met I didn't drink but started drinking socially as my husband and whole peer group drank alcohol and I was feeling intense peer pressure. I did enjoy it (maybe even too much sometime), and had fun.\n\nOver the years, especially at work events, I noticed that alcohol increases my anxiety, and despite feeling like an odd one out on many events, I switched to only drinking alcohol with my husband and family friends.\n\nThen we decided to have kids, we kept trying and of course I stopped drinking when I got pregnant. Then I breastfed and had another baby, and at the beginning of this year finally finished breastfeeding.\n\nTried alcohol again a few times and didn't enjoy it at all. As if my taste buds just went bad and all alcohol just tastes horrible. Even from half a glass of wine I am getting migraines now, and on top of that my anxiety skyrockets to extreme, including panic attacks.\n\nI've done a lot in the past half a year regarding my anxiety, focused on health, sleep etc. and decided to not drink or take anything mind altering at least until I am sure this is not going to affect my mental health negatively. Plus, we have kids now and I am the one waking up to them every morning - parenting is hard as it is, and introducing something that makes me feel worse in all aspects is not a great idea. I don't mind him getting a drink, don't judge him for that, although he keeps saying I do.\n\nMy husband is pissed. Devastated. He said it was fine while I had a reason and now I am just making up one. That alcohol is a dealbreaker for him and it was a big part of our relationship.  That I am taking a stance that will ruin our marriage. I offered to find other things to connect over, he refuses. A few months ago he wanted to get some wine - I also took a glass to keep him company but didn't drink mine beside a few sips and he got offended. Says no person in his life has turned down a drink with him except me and that he feels rejected and alone.\n\nI get that and I don't want him to feel alone. I do not oppose to him having a drink or going out with friends. I like the company and happy to get something non-alcoholic when we hang out. Of course, the frequency of those events have decresed dramatically since having kids. We don't go on dates - I offered a few times and my husband refused saying it's because I don't drink. He keeps questioning me and saying my decision is ridiculous. He also said that I am singlehandedly killing our relationship by not drinking.\n\nFrankly I have no idea where to go from here. He says we'll divorce or he'll find another woman to drink with. Unless I agree to a two drinks a week, he says our relationship is over.\n\nI just don't understand this. Feeling completely lost. I don't think alcohol is the issue here, but according to my husband it absolutely is. He is not an alcoholic as far as I know. I understand it's about connection and we did drift apart during these crazy years of having kids. I neglected myself to take care of the family and our relationship took a hit. I am doing way better and actually making time to shower, go running, do better at work. Went to a psychologist to sort out anxiety and panic attacks. Made more time to spend with my husband. We mostly watch TV in the evening and continue home renovation in the afternoons. Weekends are traveling with kids. He refuses to go on dates with me, saying it's because I don't drink - although I don't mind him drinking.\n\nI too, miss the connection we used to have and want to keep the marriage alive. There's also kids, who need their mom and dad. It sounds completely weird to me that the connection we had was alcohol, and I know it wasn't. It's my fault of completely neglecting myself and our relationship these past years, but I was in such a bad place without help and I don't know if I even was capable of doing anything differently. And now it just went to absurd - my husband is saying that I took a stance of not drinking and gave him an ultimatum, which in turn forces him to give me an ultimatum - drink or separate. I tried explaining why I don't drink but he doesn't understand it and says it's my whim which breaks the marriage.\n\nHow do I keep our marriage together? We used to be close, and happy, and I miss that a lot. He won't even hug me anymore, and now doesn't want to talk to me. I know he's hurt and feels alone and I want to reconnect, but he's been turning down my attempts.\n\nTL; DR: I stopped drinking after getting pregnant and having kids. Cannot tolerate alcohol anymore, plus my anxiety skyrockets. My husband says I am singlehandedly killing our marriage and he'll find someone else unless I start drinking again. I want to keep our marriage together.

The first time I saw her was in a scout group—we were in the same team. Our leaders randomly picked one male and one female to help in the kitchen. I was cutting potatoes while she was cutting onions, and I suggested she put on glasses to protect her eyes. That’s when everything started.\n\nWe began talking about school. I’m in university, and she was in her 3rd year of high school (that’s how our education system works, so pardon me). I tried to give her some advice, but I didn’t show any signs of being in love with her. On the other hand, she was humble, social, and made an effort to talk to me. She even said I seemed a little antisocial with the group. (I had been a scout member from 2017 to 2022, then quit for two years before returning in 2025. A lot had changed, and there were many new faces.) She also mentioned how people saw me as an “old man” because of my beard and the way I spoke—I looked more like a 25-year-old compared to most scouts, who were around 16–18.\n\nAfter the camp, I followed her on Instagram. I usually just reacted to her stories, replied to her notes, sent her motivational messages, or tried to make her laugh. Sometimes, I offered her a ride. But I still find it almost impossible to start a full conversation out of nowhere—like just saying “Hello, how are you?” and continuing from there. I’m still learning, but I’m afraid of making the wrong move or hurting her feelings.\n\nI’m not the type of guy who wants a temporary relationship—it feels inappropriate to me. I only believe in true love that can turn into marriage. I don’t want to lose her. I want her by my side. Right now, I’m obsessed with her, which makes me even more afraid to ask simple questions. The way she tries to talk to me gives me reasons to hold on to her and fight for her—I’d sacrifice anything for her.\n\nI’ve already done small favors for her, even when she didn’t ask. She would just talk about her struggles, and I tried to help however I could.\n\nNow, she’s added me to her Close Friends list on Instagram (where private stories are shared), but I still feel like I’m far from her—I’m not in her true inner circle.\n\nIn 2025–2026, she’ll be in her final year of high school (what we call BAC in my country). It’s a very important and sensitive year for every student, and I don’t want to be an obstacle for her. I want to support her. I really want to be with her. So… what should I do? Can someone please give me advice? I know dating young can be difficult, maybe even impossible, but I don’t want to give up too early. I want to prove to her how much I love her and how deeply I’m willing to sacrifice for her.\n\nExcuse me for the long paragraphs, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible so you can give me better advice.

{"id": "u/nihilscientia_1295", "user": "u/nihilscientia", "text": "Am I (M36) overreacting on finding out some truths about my fiancée (F30) on the beginning of our relationship?\n\n\n\nMe and my fiancée know each other as friends since 2021. On Sept. 3rd of 2023 we went out for lunch, it wasn't supposed to be a date, and ended hooking up that day. We had lots of talks about it for a couple of weeks because both of us felt it wasn't just a hookup but there was something more to it. On Sept. 14th she sent me the cutest audio saying she wasn't in the mood to just hookup, that she wasn't in that phase of her life, that she didn't want casual sex, and I fell in love with her when I heard it. It was some of the most beautiful things I heard in a long time. I was with some good friends when I heard the audio, they warned me about her feelings and not to screw it up and hurt her. Some backstory to their warning, I was *very* promiscuous during my single life and she knew about it as well. I'm extremely open about my life with my friends. From Sept. 14th onwards I stopped hooking up with other people, even calling off a threesome I had planned with two FWBs. I didn't tell her I had stopped hooking up with other people that day, I just wanted to be with her.\n\nOn Sept. 17th we hooked up again. Our hook ups weren't just casual sex or dates, we'd spend most of the day together when we could, like we were dating, even sleeping together in each other's home. We got together a few more days and around Sept. 27th I had to travel on business with another long time female friend. She mentioned being nervous about me going on a trip with her and was afraid we would hook up on the trip, so I asked her if she wanted exclusivity. She said she did and I told her I wanted to be exclusive too. On Sept. 30th she went to a party with her friends, this will be important later. Between Sept. 17th and Sept. 27th we were physically together for a total of five days but talking every day since Sept. 3rd. At this point she was calling my mother her mother in law and we had nicknames for each other. It very much felt like dating.\n\nI returned from my trip on Oct. 2nd and from that day onwards we were together pretty much daily. I asked her to be my girlfriend on Oct. 7th and she wasn't clear on her reply, but on Oct. 10th we formalized it and became boyfriend and girlfriend. One of our first serious talks was about me stopping contact with my ex girlfriend (who I dated for 10 years and was just a friend at that point) and former hook ups, even though I was very much exclusive with her, and on that day I deleted all my former contacts and blocked some of them. My former girlfriend was always hitting on me so I understood that need from her of going NC.\n\nFast forward two years later, we're recently engaged, she is with her sister and in the context of their talk she jokes with me about \"we're exclusive only when we started dating because when we hooked up we were free\" - and that did not sit well with me because to me we agreed on exclusivity when I traveled on business on Sept. 27th. On that same day I notice her scrolling Instagram and I saw her looking at two posts of people she had hooked up with in the past. I never talked to her about this boundary, but I felt like if I deleted all my former contacts then she would have done the same.\n\nAn important note here: I am not good at all with communication and feelings. I might just be autistic, in fact I'm currently investigating this with a therapist.\n\nThose two facts, her remark and her scrolling IG, were cooking up in me during the day and later that day I had a small panic attack and opened up with her. I told her I felt our relationship was asymmetrical because of it, that if she asked me to delete all my former contacts then she should've done the same as well without needing me to ask her. She agreed and proceeded to unfollow and block her former hook ups.\n\nThe remark was still bothering me and after a *long* discussion, about one month of it, some snooping on her phone (yes this was wrong of me but I wouldn't have found some truths without it), a lot of trickle truthing and some gaslighting of her, this is what I learned:\n\n- She hooked up with a FWB on the first week of Sept. 2023, let's call him A. I don't mind about this because I also hooked up with someone else on the same day (coincidence) and we had no concept or expectation of exclusivity at that point.\n\n- During our relationship she tried a couple of times for me to meet A, who lives in my former town, hiding the fact they used to be FWB. When I asked her about it she first stated they were just friends, then later \"they just kissed a few times\", and only after a few arguments she admitted they had hooked up several times in the past up until Sept. 9th 2023. They know each other since they are kids.\n\n- She always deleted messages from A and admits to doing it because he was always hitting on her. She ended up deleting Instagram after all of this. To me it feels like she was keeping him as a rebound.\n\n- She was sure I was hooking up during my trip with my female friend, and only later into our engagement she found out she was wrong. I know this because one day she complained about me seeing my female friend and we had an argument where I explained to her she is strictly my friend and has been for several years.\n\n- Since to her I was hooking up with my friend, she hooked up with another long time (about one year) FWB on the party of Sept. 30th. Let's call him B. They went back to her place and spent the night there. She texted me good morning that day while he was still with her. Around 11am she asked him to leave and lied to him she was going to have lunch with her family so she could be alone. She tells me she deeply regrets hooking up with him that day. Before and after (next day) her going to the party we were talking about how much we missed each other. She omitted and lied about this several times before admitting it.\n\n- On Oct. 10th, when we officially started dating, she and B were texting about her going to his place to hook up, but she didn't and ended up spending the day with me instead. She claims she never hooked up with him again after the party and just talked about it. I believe her because I read her texts with her friends over these events. Again, I know it was wrong of me to snoop but I wouldn't be sure otherwise.\n\n- She and B didn't use protection when they hooked up. She always knew I was very concerned about protection because I myself was extremely promiscuous. We only stopped using protection after I did my yearly STD exams on Dec. 2023 and verified I was all clear. I kept using protection with her for 3-4 months (Sept-Dec) because it's the adult thing to do and out of concern for her. Again, I was very promiscuous when single and sometimes it happened I engaged in unsafe sex acts. After she told me the truth about this she also did her exams and is also all clear.\n\nCurrently:\n\nWe've been having arguments about this for 50 days now.\n\nI'm feeling betrayed because I felt like we had an exclusivity clause at that point early in our relationship, even though I understand it wasn't clearly defined and communicated. I also hate the fact she was discussing with her FWB about hooking up on the very same day we ended up formalizing our dating.\n\nShe feels like it wasn't wrong or cheating because to her we were just hooking up and it was very early in the beginning of our relationship. She claims I'm making a bigger deal of it than I should.\n\nThere was a lot of trickle truthing and gaslighting until she came clean about the whole thing. In the beginning she used to tell me I was paranoid about it, that she didn't hook up with anyone in September other than me, and got her friends to reinforce this lie. She lied and omitted a lot at the beginning of our arguments over all of this. This has severely damaged my trust in her. I also feel like there might be something she's still not telling me because she basically only confirmed the things I found out about. Also, most of this happened about two years ago so I understand it might be hard for her to remember somethings.\n\nI was extremely angry at her trying to get me to friend A while hiding the fact they used to be FWB. This feels morally wrong for me. As if it's an excuse and justification for them to keep close ties even though she asked me to go no contact with everyone I used to hook up or date.\n\nWhen researching up on all of this I get the feeling we're in an anxious-avoidant trap. I'm usually a secure attachment type of person. I used to have 100% trust in her, never snooped on her phone or anything like that. Since all this started I'm feeling very anxious and she tries her best to avoid talking about all of this. She claims she doesn't like to talk about her past and that we should just move on from this, thinking about our present and our future.\n\nGoing devil's advocate, when we started hooking up she was still in the \"mourning\" phase of a past relationship where the guy cheated on her with a close friend. She has mentioned this several times, to me and her friends, that she was emotionally blocked at the time and didn't see herself in a relationship just yet.\n\nTo be clear: I would NOT have a problem with all of this had she just straight up told me the truth in the beginning. I understand the beginning of relationships between friends can get messy sometimes. I just wish she was honest with me from the beginning as I was with her. I never hid from her the fact I hooked up with other people before Sept. 14th.\n\nHer sister told me I should just \"get revenge\" and hook up with someone else but to me this just feels wrong. I don't want to do that and it wouldn't fix anything at all. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind or something.\n\n*Before we started having these arguments our relationship was pretty much perfect.* I'm deeply in love with this woman. I want to marry her and have children with her. However, these events have deeply shaken my trust in her. It feels like I'm mourning the death of the perfect persona I admired of her and I'm left accepting her as I know her now, someone capable of sleeping with other people while being with me and lying.\n\nI'm feeling very anxious about these issues and I don't know how to best handle it. Every time I talk to her about it, it turns into a huge argument. How can we fix this situation as a couple?\n\nNOTE: English is not my first language, it's Brazilian Portuguese. To us \"hook up\" means \"ficar\" and \"to date\" means \"namorar\", they are similar but different concepts.\n\nTL;DR: Two years into our relationship I find out my fiancee hooked up with a FWB when we were around date n. 6 when I was travelling with a female friend. At the time she claimed she didn't want to just hookup so a relationship was implied. She feels like it wasn't cheating but to me it does.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He got laid off from his job and hasn’t been able to find anything new since. He promises me that he is applying every day, but I am starting to question if that’s the truth or not. I’m currently in graduate school as well as working my part time job (15-20 hours a week), so I usually sleep 11PM till around 8 or 9AM. Our bedroom is set up with our bed and both of our pcs, we are both very into gaming. Every morning I wake up, I hear my boyfriend on his computer laughing and joking with his friends on an online game. I’ll yell over a “good morning” from our bed two to three times until he eventually acknowledges me and says “good morning, mi amor” and he goes straight back to his game. I usually lay in bed on my phone expecting him to come crawl into bed with me and spend time with me before I start my own busy day. Eventually I get out of bed to get ready for the day and that’s when he gets off and comes to bed, and begs me to lay in bed and cuddle him until he falls asleep.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend stays awake from about 6pm until 9am and sleeps the entire day. And it’s starting to impact how I view our relationship. I’m starting to resent that I work and go to school and spend most of my day working towards our future, and he doesn’t even go to sleep with me at night, in our home and bed, that I’m working so hard to keep for us. I cook every day for myself, and he eats whatever is left over, and I clean on my days off. What makes it worse is that I don’t necessarily like his friends that he is playing with all night. It’s a new group of friends he met about three months ago on the game. Lots of girls get involved in the group of friends and they always end up flirting with him or straight up shit talk me because they like him. He always rejects their advances, tells them off, and blocks them, but it just has ignited such an anxiety in me that he’s constantly surrounded by people disrespecting me and my relationship. I’ve brought this up to him before and he simply told me he loved me and he would never leave or cheat on me.

About 5 weeks ago, out of nowhere, she said she couldn’t do the distance anymore. The confusing part is we never actually said the words “break up.” Just two weeks before that, I visited her everything felt normal, we were still planning our next trip, and she was talking with her sister about visiting me. Then in one night she completely flipped.\n\nSince then, she’s barely talked to me, started spending time with a new guy, and even basically moved in with him right after. Her family including her sister and mom have both said this isn’t like her at all. She’s been drinking more, not sleeping, and avoiding them, even though she used to always want to be with her sister’s kids. Her sister thinks she might’ve been manipulated into this, especially because this new guy already has a reputation for being abusive.\n\nHer sister has stayed in touch with me because she’s just as confused as I am. She doesn’t know how to handle this or how to bring it up to her without pushing her further away. She even said if they ever do confront her, she might want me to fly down and be there, so it’s clear she’s not just hurting herself but the people around her too.\n\nI know the relationship may never be the same, but I still care about her safety and well-being more than anything.\n\nWould it be worth it to fly down and help if they ask me to?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

This guy took photos of me without me realising, he even took a photo of window of where I was staying, to some this may seem silly and pointless but it’s because it meant something to him. I didn’t want to lead him on, I told him I didn’t feel anything for him romantically and that we could just be friends to which I really hurt him.\n\nIt was hard to make a decision that quickly on my feelings as I was only there for a week, it was too much pressure, I didn’t want to hurt him, so I thought the best thing was to just say no basically. But then my feelings towards him changed and I decided to stop being an idiot and give him a chance, things developed between us. I apologised to him many times on how I was in the beginning, being unsure of my feelings and hurting him.\n\nHe had wrote my a letter, the night I told him I didn’t have feelings for him, dedicating a song to me that is about someone’s love that is irreplaceable, unforgettable, nothing compares to the feelings they felt with that person. Ending the letter ‘maybe in another life we could be something more’. He gave this to me after my feelings had changed.\n\nWhen I got home, we decided to carry things on, these are just some of the things he said- sleeping together was beautiful, how can he forget my eyes, he can’t explain the feelings he has and the way I make him feel, what happened was too strong and too beautiful to only last for a short time, I’d ruined him, I’m his, he was away with his friends but he felt like apart of him was missing and he said it was me, these things and so many other things he said to suggest that he wanted to have something with me. He was always so thoughtful and caring, he wanted to know everything about me, open up to him, to which I really tired to. He just seemed to be able to read me, know me so well already. He said he wanted to do things right with me, be open and honest with each other, he wanted to take care of me and be there for me, he didn’t want us to end. We would speak all day every day, and most nights for hours, about everything and anything. The things we wanted to do together, we missed each other, couldn’t wait to be with each other again, to feel each other.\n\nBefore I saw him again we had an argument, I asked him what he wanted from me and how he saw us and if there was a possibility of a relationship, because of the distance etc, as he didn’t seem to be putting in the effort like he did before in regards to seeing me, and my feelings were continuing to grow for him, I just wanted clarity so I could go about my feelings accordingly. He was angry that I would accuse him of not wanting to see me. He told me that he told me from the beginning that he didn’t want a long distance relationship, he’s had one before and it didn’t work (he never told me this) but didn’t want to end what we had, so I said basically it’s just an ‘if and when’ friends with benefits type of thing, he didn’t like this at all, ‘what we had is much more than that’. But he said he was angry because until I brought it up he hadn’t thought about it, he just went day by day, and now I had made him think about ‘our’ future. He said that I am trying to end it because I’ve decided I don’t need him anymore, this hurt me, I opened up to him about how I was feeling, about how much I do need him, how much he already meant to me, and I was scared that I didn’t want it to end. We said we were going to enjoy our moments with each other like we did the last time and not worry about anything else.\n\nWhen I saw him, it was different, I held off because I knew he didn’t see a future with me, I wasn’t how I wanted to be with him, and he was definitely different with me, I didn’t feel the same ‘love’ from him to which I had felt the first time, and throughout the whole time until us meeting again, even after the argument. Looking back at how he was and how it felt, it was like he didn’t actually want to be with me, he met me out of principle. He only saw me for a few hours, I asked him to stay with me in the evening, as we had done once the last time, but he said he didn’t think it was a good idea after the conversation we had had. But he was okay to sleep with me when he saw me earlier on in the day? I was trying to enjoy our moments together like we both said, but it had seemed that he had changed his mind already.\n\nHe then ended it with me, he told me that mentally and physically he’s attracted to me, we had a spark mentally, he can talk to me for hours without getting bored; I’m perfect just the way I am, I’m an amazing person, beautiful etc etc. but when we slept together there was no spark, he felt nothing, he felt the same apparently when we slept together before, but never said anything. He wanted to try again as he thought my shyness before would have been a factor. He had realised he wanted a relationship, and with how he feels about our sexual relationship and the distance there was no point in carrying on. He had come to see me, but speaking after he said it was hard for him too, he said he had tears in his eyes as he wanted to have that feeling with me, he’s happy to have met me, he couldn’t have asked for more from life, I was this beautiful thing that life wanted to give him.\n\nBut there are reasons to why are spark might not have been there, as I have my personal issues to which I opened up to him about after. I’m angry that he just decided to end it like he did, not even talking to me about it first about he felt, after everything I felt he didn’t even try.\n\nI told him I respected that he ended it with me, and of course I would want to try again, but I knew from his side it was done. But after everything I didn’t want to lose him, I didn’t want to lose him as a friend as he had become such a big part of my life, he knows more about me than anyone else. Our romantic relationship hadn’t really had the chance to develop as we were physically together for a short time. He said no, we should end our relationship forever, mainly for me because I wouldn’t be able to move on, and that my feelings scared him. This made me angry, like what the fuck??? Everything we ever said and did was with deep feelings and emotions, always instigated by him. He did and said everything he could to make sure I had some sort of feelings for him and now it scares him? I got so mad, I questioned everything he ever did and everything he ever said to me, told him he had played me, fucked with my mind and my feelings. He knew from the very beginning where I lived, why pursue someone you know lives in a different country if you don’t want a long distance relationship. But he was still adamant he did everything with his heart.\n\nHis last message was awful, saying that he never told me he wanted a future with me, told me how he feels about long distance, he never thought he could have a future with me and never wanted it. His feelings have changed, he doesn’t feel anything for me, and doesn’t want anything from me, if I want to accept it fine, otherwise he’s going to move on anyway.\n\nCan someone please help me move on, how can he just switch, just like that?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We dated for 2.5 years — a relationship that had its fair share of highs, cuddles, college bus rides, silly fights, and unfortunately… jealousy.\n\nThe issue? There was this one guy — someone she saw a lot because he lived nearby and they took the same bus to college. Nothing ever happened between them (I know that now), but my jealousy started chipping away at our peace. Along with typical couple hiccups, it got to a point where we mutually broke up — not with anger, but with a quiet heartbreak and promises to stay close.\n\nShe said she’d lost the feeling and didn’t want to be unfair to either of us by staying when her heart wasn’t sure anymore. That line haunted me for months.\n\nAfter the breakup, I spiraled into Reddit. I made this account, posted our story across subs, read thousands of similar tales — stories of lost feelings, of rekindled love, of final goodbyes. Most replies told me to move on. “If she’s lost the feeling, it won’t come back,” they said.\n\nBut life had other plans.\n\nCut to last year: we both got into master’s programs, on different continents — she moved to the US, I moved to Europe. Thousands of miles apart, and yet... weirdly, we became closer. Being alone in foreign places made us rely on each other more — daily texts, random calls, helping each other through visa nightmares, exam breakdowns, and late-night loneliness.\n\nNo expectations, no pressure. Just two people who knew each other too well, finding comfort again.\n\nAnd sometime over those months… the feeling came back. We both felt it, but waited. Neither wanted to ruin the bond we had rebuilt.\n\nEventually, we talked about it. She said: “I don’t know when or how, but I started feeling again.” And I said: “I never really stopped.”\n\nWe’ve been back together for 10 months now. Still long-distance. Still on different continents. But this time — no jealousy, no overthinking, just effort, growth, and a little belief that maybe, just maybe, some stories do get a second chapter.\n\nTL;DR\nDated for 2.5 years, broke up due to jealousy and \"lost feelings.\" Stayed close, but she didn’t want to get back unless it felt right again.

Is that fair?\n\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years now and we live in Nashville, TN. I’m originally from MA and she’s from Austin, TX but we both met here in Nashville shortly after each moving here. We currently live together and have made plans for travel and our future together but keep running into issues on where we’ll live.\nOver the past few months, she has been getting more and more set on moving back to Texas because she said she always planned on it and that’s where her family is. She is very close with her family and talks to them on the phone nearly every day. I’m not very close with my family that still lives up in New England but I still love them.\nWe both are to the point where we want to leave Nashville and live somewhere else, I want to move out west to the mountains because I lived there for 6 months previously and loved it. She told me she was only open to Denver and for 1-2 years at the most. I want to get my masters degree while out west because there’s a lot more education opportunities there with virtually none in Nashville for my field. I’m working remote in an unrelated field that I don’t love and have put my plans on hold for her until she was ready to leave Nashville.\n\nWe then talked about moving to maybe Charleston after Denver and settling down there but now she is saying that she can’t suppress the feeling of missing her parents anymore. She needs to be near them and wants to be close enough to have causal random dinners and be at everything. She said I’m the only thing keeping her from her dream of moving back to Texas and being happy. She pitched it as doing 2 years there as her 2 yr choice when she was previously very against moving around again, but I know it’ll turn into more than 2 years\nShe wants to do it right around the time we’d have kids so her parents can help take care of them, but after 2yrs I doubt she’s just going to be ok uprooting and leaving. I think she’s hoping we get so tied down that we won’t end up leaving. And I fear if I do convince her to go, the feeling of not being close to her family will come back and she’ll resent me for it. She insists this won’t be true but I’m very skeptical\nNo part of me wants to move to Austin, I’m a very outdoorsy person and need to be close to the beach or mountains and Austin has neither. Even Nashville is too far away from the mountains or beach for me and Austin is worse. I also can’t stand the weather, I have a serious heart condition and feel the heat more than most, Nashville summers are brutal super hot and humid and I hate not being able to enjoy being outside from end of May to mid September, meanwhile Austin will be even worse and longer. Plus there is nothing for me, no friends, no family, no mountains or beach, and the career I want won’t be possible from there. My gf doesn’t seem to care she told me I can get a remote job and work, implying to keep doing the career I do now that I don’t enjoy.\n\nI don’t know if we’re compatible, I feel like I have so much to live for and so many dreams. I don’t want my future decided by where an elderly couple want to live because before she was saying she was moving to where they were when they were looking at potentially moving out of Texas.

I haven’t dated since I was 22, after leaving a very serious and abusive relationship. The guy I’m writing about is 23M. We met while studying abroad last year and became really good friends.\n\nDuring my second semester there, I realized I had developed feelings for him. He was going abroad that semester, so I didn’t say anything, but toward the end of the semester I noticed my feelings were really strong. Over the summer, I went back to my home country, but we still texted every couple of days.\n\nThis semester, he and a few of my friends are doing a study abroad a couple states away from me, and it’s very easy for me to visit. He has a very close female friend (21F) who I also get along with really well. They’ve both made it clear they’re not interested in each other, and I genuinely believe that, but they’ve always been very close.\n\nI visited recently and found out she crashed in his room last night. His roommate was also in the room, so it wasn’t just the two of them, but I caught myself feeling jealous. It’s been such a long time since I’ve been interested in someone, and I’m scared of ruining the friendship by either acting on these feelings too soon or by letting jealousy get the better of me.\n\nMy question is: How do I handle these feelings without damaging the friendship? Should I be honest with him about how I feel, or should I just focus on keeping it platonic?\n\nTL;DR: I (24F) have feelings for my friend (23M) I met while studying abroad. He’s close to another girl (21F) who’s also my friend, but they insist they’re just friends. I felt jealous when I found out she stayed in his room (with his roommate there too).

What do I do?!\n\nMy (M22) girlfriend (F22) and I have been together for 6.5 years, and we've lived together for the last 2 years. \n\nMy girlfriend and I's relationship has been difficult. I think we got together to young, and I specifically, had a lot of growing to do. With that being said, I've done a lot of damage to our relationship over the years. She always seemed to be ahead of me in the maturity aspect. Well, my girlfriend hit her breaking point and she outlined four major issues in our relationship. \n\n1) I've caused her a lot of trauma that she feels I've never taken accountability for since I still participate in some behaviors, and never truly apologized. For instance, I consistently would hide porn usage and she'd find out in unfortunate ways. She trusted me to be reliable, but instead I'd subconsciously get myself fired and the fincial responsibilities would all fall into her. Additionally, I still fall through on promises and agreements we make. \n\n2) She is looking for a partner who is ambitious, intelligent, emotionally mature, and has a growth mindset. I also want this for myself, but understand it will take a lot of work to get there.\n\n3) My girlfriend dosent really have family, and always imagined that she'd be able to call her partner's family her own. Unfortunately, my family doesn't like her and she does not like them. She doesn't like my family because my mom talks badly about her and always wants to one up her. \n\n4) The fincial stress is killing her. She constantly has to pick up the bills and carrys the mental weight of our relationship in every aspect. She budgets for us, makes the grocery bills, covers for things when I cannot afford it, and plans dates. She doesn't remember that last time I took her out on a date. \n\nSo, what do I do? She is my best friend and I couldn't imagine a life without her. I feel so stupid for behaving like this. I know, she knows, there isn't much we can do about my family besides distance ourselves, but she is hoping for improvement in the other categories. Can I really change and become that person she wants me to be? \n\nShes thinking she might leave me, but since we live together, is allowing things to run it's course until our lease is over.

As in right now, we are staying in a comfort zone of the very basic things we always did, and it's hard for me to imagine going further.\n\nThis is NOT a compatibility issue in my opinion, because the things we already do, we do them pretty good, and when we talk about kinks and boudaries we have very similar ones, I think this is just and intimacy and confidence issue. We struggle with being vocal about our interest and with feeling safe in new territory.\n\nThis is because of a couple things:\n\n1. we have sex very rarely (around once a month in the past year), so we probably are still in the initial phase of building trust and intimacy in that area\n2. the reason we have sex rarely is that I've struggled (and sometimes still struggle) with sharp pain during sex because of a pelvic floor health issue, I've been treated for that and now I am mostly pain-free, but it will never go away fully, and it probably left a scar on both of us: I am scared of pain, and he is scared of hurting me\n3. when we met (I was 17 and he was 18) I had already been in a long term realationship, while I was his first gf and sexual partner ever, at that time, I was unlearning a tendency I had of consenting to sex when I didn't want to, and he knew that. Sometimes I think he doesn't feel safe initiating sex with me because he is worried of forcing me, since his first approach with sex was with someone who struggled with consent\n\nI am looking for advice so that we can both be more comfortable and let ouselves go, I would do anything to see him horny and hungry for me, without any filter, and I need to be able to let myself go too.\n\nOther than this there is no issue in our relationship, we have been toghether for 4 years and it all went very smoothly, we communicate often, we almost never fight, and have many shared interests and usually have a lot of fun together.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBecause of past experiences with pain and other issues, me and my boyfriend of 4 years have sex very rarely and only stick to our comfort zone, I am looking for advice so that we can both become more confident and let ourselves go, in order to have more meaningful sex.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I Think It May Be Unreasonable.\n\nMy boyfriend’s sister asked us a few days ago if we wanted to go to a theme park with her for a Halloween event. I’ve never met his sister in person before and have only talked to her through message once so this would be my first time meeting her. My boyfriend also hasn’t seen her in person for quite a few years. \n\nThe theme park she asked us to go to is about 2 hours from my boyfriend and I. I told her that it sounded like a good time! She then followed up with that message letting me know she doesn’t have a car so she’ll need a ride there. The thing is, she lives 1 hour and 30 minutes past the theme park. So we’d be driving around 3 hr. 30 min. to go pick her up, drive 1+ hr back in the opposite direction, another 1+ hr to take her back home afterwards, and then another 3 hr. 30 min. to drive back home. The event also starts at 7pm which is a very long night because of the distance. \n\nShe then mentioned we could stay the night with her. I don’t know if I feel exactly comfortable doing this since I don’t know her well at all and I also have a sick cat with chronic kidney issues and IBD who needs medication daily, as well as a few month old kitten so we would need to hire a pet sitter and that adds a lot more to our plate. \n\nI brought up my concerns with my boyfriend and he insisted that he’d drive the whole way but I still didn’t feel so sure about the idea. He guilt tripped me a bit telling me he hasn’t seen his sister in years. I told him I never said we couldn’t go see his sister (he wouldn’t go unless I did by the way), I just hope there can be more of a compromise, like maybe we make the drive but she pays for his ticket since she invited us. Or she pays us gas money.. He told me she doesn’t really have the budget for it and “we just won’t go then.” Well we don’t really have the budget either?? If she can’t afford to chip in some then I’m not sure why we can’t at least do something cheaper and closer to where she lives?\n\nI want him to see his sister and I don’t want to be the reason he doesn’t, but I also feel like the all of the responsibility is on us and she’s been a little bit pushy for an answer. When she mentioned the car issue, I hadn’t responded for several hours (it was my boyfriend’s birthday at the time so it was a very busy day, and I had a lot to do to prepare for his celebration) and so she ended up messaging my boyfriend asking for me to answer her. I was a little annoyed because the initial message she sent me was last Monday in which she asked if I liked theme parks. I responded 3 hours later and told her that I did. She didn’t respond until his birthday which was 5 days later and that’s when she asked us if we wanted to go to the theme park with her. \n\nMy boyfriend came home from work today letting me know his sister wants to call us to talk about the plan since we haven’t given an answer yet. My boyfriend is a people pleaser, so I know he’ll just say yes, but I don’t know if it’s reasonable for me to ask for a compromise. I feel guilty because it makes me feel like I’m the one standing in the way, but at the same time, it seems unfair for the whole burden to be on us when we were the ones invited and it’s not the best first impression on her end either.\n\nWhat do you think is the reasonable thing to do? \n\n**EDIT:** The comments I’ve received have opened my eyes to a different perspective. I want to add that when my boyfriend’s sister asked me last Friday (his birthday) if we wanted to go to this Halloween event with her, she emphasized that she wanted me to keep it a secret from my him. When I hadn’t responded within a few hours that day, she texted my boyfriend asking for me to respond, and then ended up telling him what the plan was.. It almost seems as if she wanted to play it off as a “birthday surprise” for my boyfriend but got impatient because it’s something that she’s desperate to attend and needs a ride.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We were best friends, and knew each other for 2 years before finally getting together. I’m going into 2nd yr of uni (2/3), he’s going into his 3rd year (3/4). So we both have 2 yrs of uni left.\n\nI have Muslim Pakistani parents. His parents are Indian and white, but he doesn’t have any restrictions on him when it comes to pretty much anything. \n\nMy bf emphasised on meeting my parents, and not hiding our relationship because he didn’t want them to hate him if we told them like 1 year into dating. He didn’t want them to think of him as sneaky etc. \n\nWe told them. And suddenly it’s been outlined, that they will not let us live together, or go on holiday together, before marriage.\n\nFor context. I am not a practicing Muslim. My dad accepts this, and my mother knows I don’t practice. I don’t pray- I don’t even know how to pray. Don’t wear a headscarf, I don’t fast unless I’m asked to by my parents during Ramadan. I never have. On top of this, my parents let me wear what I want. Short skirts, backless dresses. I don’t have a curfew when I go see my home friends when I get home from uni (I can drive). I study in London and live away from home (Manchester). I’ve even gone on solo trips which my mum booked for me in Europe (1 day 1 night stuff). \n\nSo for Muslim Pakistani parents- I’m a very free kid.\n\nAnd in my head, I don’t have the ‘Asian’ view, of marrying without dating someone for 2-3 years minimum. Without having lived with them. Me and my bf both share the idea, that living together and marriage should come naturally and not forced. My parents wanted me married between 23/25. \n\nThis all comes back to the idea that, my parents don’t want me to have sex b4 marriage. They can’t believe that nothing would happen between me and my bf before marriage if we stayed under the same roof. But I don’t share the religious view. I have had sex b4, not with him, and not that my parents know. He’s fully okay with waiting for marriage.\n\nMind, we both are staying in London separately rn, we can see each other whenever we want to anyways.\n\nMy parents wanted me to have an arranged type marriage when I got out of uni at 23ish-25. But even if I was single at that point in my life, I don’t think I will ever agree to that? I’m not having an arranged marriage. So why dont I stay in this relationship now if I’ve already accepted I’m going to have to fight later for my freedom no matter how much current relationship goes.\n\nThey are all meeting on Friday and I have to decide:\nA: do I break things off now, and accept my Asian fate that I can’t ever live with a partner before marriage. \nB: Or do I lie to my parents and pretend to accept their terms, sneak around for a few yrs \nC: do I lie to my parents, pretend to accept their terms, and in 2-3 years time; switch up, and turn on them if they still don’t accept.\n\n—\nTLDR:\n\nMy bf has explicitly stated to me. He will not get married with having at least 1 holiday with his partner and also living tg before marriage. \n\nMy parents have stated: I cannot under any circumstances live with my bf/any partner before marriage. \n\nThe options above are what I’m thinking. Help.\n—\n\n\nEdit: I have been in many relationships. If I wasn’t sure on this guy, if I wasn’t sure I someday wanted to marry him (someday), then I wouldn’t be doing all this so early.

I'm now doubting our relationship.\n\nHello,\n\nI'm trying to work out something with myself that feels complex but may be much simpler since I tend to over think. When I first started crushing on my current boyfriend of 3 months we had already been friends for 3 years at that point. He was aware of my queerness and identity well before we dated. Always respected my pronouns and we value a lot of the same beliefs.\n\nWhen it first started I could hardly get him out of my head. Sketchbooks littered with drawings of him, playlists dedicated to every moment, etc. Our beginning wasn't anything to be proud of since it started with intercourse. Most conversations lingered on people or characters we found attractive and one thing led to another.\n\nI was just over the moon to have his attention so I didn't mind. Feelings and confessions came after the fact and were initiated by me. The following dates and conversations were phenomenal and our intimacy skyrocketed. \n\nHowever, he admitted something to me that hurt my feelings an awful lot. That I am more obsessed/into him than he is with me. Some friends have even stated it's a bad sign when a (AMAB) isn't more into you (AFAB) off the bat. I've brushed this off considering I don't identify with my assigned gender but now this thought has intensified after he said that to me.\n\nHe prefers to call me his girlfriend - which before I didn't mind since I also like the way it sounds. Loves my more feminine outfits and getups. Any sexual media we consume together is 90% straight since he doesn't enjoy masc/men. Now I'm putting it all under a microscope. \n\nDoes he really genuinely like me for me or is it because of my body? Was he ever actually into me or did he take advantage of the fact I was hopelessly in love? I want to say no since he does tell me he loves me but when I dig deeper it's the same response or a complete lack of action.\n\nHe says he loves me for my kindness and that I'm funny. That I'm pretty. That I don't judge him for who he is. When he asks me the same I do my best to paint a mosaic of feelings I struggle to verbalize. Always changing it up to show him how much I really feel when I'm around him. \n\nThis seems to genuinely make him happy so I love to do it but I do feel a bit let down when he doesn't put forth the same effort. Same with footing the bill for food or gift giving. He is much more reserved and gives simple gifts (I had to ask for flowers even though I had given him flowers prior without being asked) or a split the bill kind of person. I'm far more exuberant in gift giving and often take over the tab. I'm not looking to be treated like a woman but it would be nice to know he thinks of me without being asked.\n\nNow I don't know how I feel and I can't find the courage to ask him in a way that wouldn't offend him. I don't believe this would break our relationship but it does give me a sense that we may not be on the same wavelength.\n\nTLDR;\nBoyfriend of 3 months (friend of 3 years prior) said I'm more obsessed/into him than he is with me.

Then he moved back to my city for work. We kinda started dating but it was always not so serious. In my life I always had some abroad plans so when we started dating, we thought that we only start this because we can’t control our emotions and can’t keep being friends only and at some point of my life i might go to a very far country that he might not able to come (but my initial abroad plan was cancelled because i didn’t got a scholarship that i need so we dated in the same city for years). \n\nAfter a year of dating, i started to be the person in the relationship that requests more attention (after the honeymoon phase ended). Somehow we managed to still stay in a relationship for 3 years even though we broke up for short whiles due to some fights related to us not fit each other that much or him not giving me girlfriend attention (only giving wholesome friend type of attention). \n\nLast year I moved in a different city for studies but i was visiting once in 3 weeks so we didn’t have a long period that we didn’t see each other. And he visited my city once (me coming to his place was much easier and economic than him coming to my city as i don’t have anywhere to host him) \n\n\nThis year I moved to a different country temporarily for 6 months. In 2 weeks ill go back to my country actually. In these 6 months we never met as i didn’t go back to my country and he didn’t come to the country i live now (he didn’t put much effort to get a visa even tho we were talking about him coming and us traveling together) \nthe first 2 months I was trying to have online calls and dates so that we still have a bond. When I invited him to these he was joining and having fun. But later on, my life in this country got more and more busy and I didn’t invite him to anything online. He also didn’t do it so many weeks passed without having contact other than short texts. As time passed I also got more distant to him and valued my friends and life in this new country more so i wasn’t nagging him much about the lack of communication. At some point I mentioned him that we got more distant and he agreed. He told me that he doesn’t know why it happened and he was joking that (as if talking about a business plan) “well we need to take action about this issue” when i asked him how he feels about this. Usually he has a personality that doesn’t share his emotions and jokes to change the topic or the focus of the question. \nI was talking this with my therapist also and I was telling her how he doesn’t show me attention. My therapist told me that I need to openly tell him that I need attention so I did, I called him and we had a convo about attention and I asked him “I want this from a boyfriend, can you give me the attention I need?” and he said “I am not sure if I can give the amount of attention you want, my personality isn’t like that and if I fake it, you’ll understand and it will be not genuine” and we decided to think more about this and not decide anything now. \n\nRecently I had another session with my therapist and she told me that how I describe attention might be different from someone else as it can be a vague term. So she wanted me to describe it. This made sense for me and I asked the same thing to him on text. I told him “my therapist mentioned this and that blablabla so, how do you describe attention?” \nhe responded me like “how i describe attention?” “I think we both know what attention means and we dont need to have this conversation” I just sent sad emoji face to that and he said “ I dont know its just we dont have anything to talk about and i find it difficult to do small talk and show attention, its like we’re very distant” and then i told that “okay nevermind i just asked because we talked this with my doctor so i wanted to ask you before i forget” \nand then he said “im sorry, are you okay?” and i said i am okay. so that was our last texts and i dont think we’re gonna talk much later \n\n\nthe thing is as he is a close friend and a boyfriend for such a long time i feel like he was the right person for me and he was sweet when we were not long distance.

As of right now, we only communicate through Discord. Four months in I sent him my phone number and for some reason he refuses to use it. I have had multiple discussions with him since then about how I would love to be more integrated into his real life and how at this point it bothers me and hurts my feelings that he refuses to use it but I’m just met with excuses if he will use it soon. \n\nLast night I asked him to join a call with me because I can no longer take this, especially when he won’t give me any reasoning for it.

How can I move forward?\n\nBackstory: About three years ago my friend started dating this girl Ella, with her joining our friendgroup. They dated for about 2 years and during that time, Ella and I became pretty close. We had a lot in common and eventually we considered each other our \"best friend\". I want to make it clear that my feelings were very platonic during this time, and I respected her and my friend a lot. Despite this, my other friends would make jokes to me about how I am \"stealing\" her by hanging out with her so much, even though all parties involved had no issues. Their relationship was very rocky and I listened to Ella vent pretty often, until they eventually broke up in July. After this, things were mostly chill but at a certain point I realized I might have feelings. Due to her being my best friend, as well as my friends' jokes leaving a bad taste in my mouth, I pushed the crush aside. After all, I do genuinely value her immensely as a friend.\n\nFast forward to now, a few months later. Ella is currently hitting it off decently with this guy she met at work who is quite a bit older (he is 35). He came on very strong with very apparent (sometimes sexual) flirting and she is reciprocating albeit more innocently. She talks about him all the time and has the \"butterflies\" kind of crush. They have yet to hang out or do anything, its still only flirting.\n\nNow the matter at hand. I was talking to a friend and he told me he had a decent hunch that she had a thing for me. I thought it was funny and brought it up to her. She surprisingly responded saying, \"welllll maybe at some point or another I did, obviously I don't now\" (since shes talking to a guy at work). \"I feel like its normal for that to happen when a guy and girl become really close friends like that.\" When I heard this I got distracted and didn't think to mention that I had felt the same. However, later that day we hung out at my place and I brought it up when she was leaving.\n\nThe exchange was basically:\n\nMe: “just so you don’t feel like a COMPLETE loser, I also felt the same at some point” (I didn’t mention I still have a crush).\n\nHer: “Aww you’re saying you liked me too at some point?? Why didn’t you say something smh, we could’ve- kidding haha”\n\nMe: “Don’t worry though, we are on the same page. And I know you’re with [guy from work]”\n\nHer: “Well I’m not with him yeeeet” in a joking voice \n\nMe: “With how you guys are going you probably will be, don’t worry haha”\n\nIt did get me thinking though, IS there a path for me here? Was it even worth saying I felt the same about her? As much as I want to respect that she's talking/flirting with a guy from work, I realized this might be my last opportunity. Also, she still talks about this guy pretty often even after our exchange. I'm just really confused as this is still very recent, and want to be able to sort my thoughts. Advice is greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: my crush just admitted she liked me at some point, and i told her the same thing. wondering if theres a way forward for me despite her currently talking to someone from work", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Hi Reddit, m(25) living in Latam m(28) living in Japan. We started our relationship when he first came to Latam and I felt in love so much that we never stopped talking (January 2025). After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year. I love him so much and hurts me to think that I won’t be able to see him and kiss him ever again, but I feel that I don’t deserve that kind of love and I would give everything of me and even get in debt to spend time with him 💔.

It’s a bit jumbled and all over the place. \n\nBackground - we started dating at 16 and the start of our relationship was rocky to say the least. We were in college at the time, and then we ended up going to the same university in our hometown. We are now both graduated - he got on to a really good graduate scheme at a good company in a job he likes, pays well. I went on to do a Masters at the same university. We have a lot of mutual friends and hang out with our guy friends quite a bit. \n\nI won’t go into too much detail because I don’t want this to be more lengthy than it already is, but he has continually disrespected me throughout our relationship and I think I’ve finally come to terms that maybe I should leave him. I always loved him so much and so I always thought he would just grow out of it as he matured, but even outside of his mistakes he still doesn’t really treat me well. He has made a number of mistakes throughout the years, including one recently which I will explain, and now I have done something bad too. \n\nLast winter time (Dec 2024) one of our guy friends (20M), I’ll call him Ed, invited 2 girl friends that he knew to our weekly pub quiz night. I only went to these pub quizzes occasionally, not every time. The first time they were invited, I wasn’t there. My boyfriend told me about it and said they were really young (18, but looked 16 apparently) and it was awkward he had invited them. I eventually met them a couple weeks later, and I agreed it was awkward. The guys gave them the nicknames of Pinky and Porky (a little demeaning, but this is what I will use as their names in this story). I saw them when I was in the bathroom and Pinky was being friendly and complimented my jeans, and we had a quick chat. Porky didn’t say much. The months went on, and they started hanging out with these two girls a lot more. Sometimes I was there, sometimes I wasn’t. I got bad vibes from Porky, and I could tell she had a crush on my boyfriend. It got to a point where he was flirting with her in front of my face. I let it slide for a while, because he is a ‘flirty person’. But I started feeling uncomfortable around them and so whenever we would plan something, I would ask my boyfriend not to invite them. He always gave the excuse that Ed had invited them and it wasn’t his fault. But then it became very obvious that he wanted them there too. On his call logs, he had called Porky on many different occasions. He even used to call her in front of me and would basically beg her to come. He invited just her (Pinky was busy) to his birthday party (just a house party at a free house with a few friends). I arrived late to this party, to find her sat there on her phone looking a little embarrassed (there were other people at this party who had never met her and didn’t know who she was). She left pretty soon after I arrived and said her friend had an emergency. I spoke to my bf and said why on earth did he invite her. He started getting defensive about it, and I started to get pissed off. This is March time by the way. I would say to him I don’t understand why he always invited her to stuff, including when I wasn’t there, and said I thought it was really weird considering she’s 18 too. He started to gaslight me and also made me feel like a bitch. He said I was just being awkward and I had no reason to dislike her. \n\nHe came to mine one weekend, and I saw he had makeup on his jumper. I knew immediately it was from her, as they had been to the pub that week. I asked him about it and acted confused at first, but then said she had hugged him at the pub because something happened with her family and she was upset. I later found out she drove him home that night, just those two in the car. \n\nFast forward to the end of June, she added me on snapchat and then sent me a message a few days after. I was out with friends (not close friends) when I opened the message. I felt so sick to my stomach, and couldn’t hold in my tears. It completely ruined my weekend. I spoke to my boyfriend over the phone when i got back to my hotel room and he was with our guy friends back at home. He already knew what had happened somehow and he was very apologetic. He said he “knows how it looks” but said that she is lying and exaggerating. To keep it brief, she had said that: he was being inappropriate with her, had tried to kiss her twice in the car, had made a comment saying ‘everyone thinks we want to shag eachother’ and that they should do it and ‘it would be great,’ and had called her one night asking her what she was wearing and then tried to facetime her. On the phone, I then asked him individually if each thing happened. He basically admitted to most of it but said it ‘didn’t happen like that’ and was out of context. He denied trying to kiss her. He said he doesn’t recall the phone call asking what she is wearing etc. But he has a bad drinking habit and gets quite drunk, so it is possible he just doesn’t remember this.\n\nHonestly there is more I could say about that situation, but it’s long enough as it is. I saw him the following day, though we didn’t get to speak about it much because we were with his family. Turns out he had known for a week that Pinky was going to message me, but never said anything to me about it. I felt fed up and drained, and it felt different to the other times things like this had happened. He asked if I wanted to break up with him, and I said no. He even said at one point that I “should probably break up with him”. \n\nThe following weekend I went to Italy, sort of a business trip but I can’t go into too much detail. There were a lot of people there around my age and it was a super fun week. I met a guy (26M) there, and I wasn’t looking for it but the connection just happened. I was drunk on the last night of the trip and felt unwell. He looked after me, got me water and held my hair back when I was almost being sick. I fell asleep on him lay down outside and he gave me a very quick kiss on the lips before he left. He admitted he had feelings for me but understood the situation with my boyfriend (I had explained the situation to him briefly). We had chemistry, and even other people had noticed it. \n\nI think he has some qualities that my boyfriend doesn’t, like patience, calmness and understanding. I have been messaging him since then (since july) and have sexted him multiple times. We also met up in London (another sort-of business trip) and ended up kissing more passionately. We both wanted to have sex but I said we couldn’t as i would feel far too guilty. I still feel guilty now, but i haven’t stopped talking to him. I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t live in my country although it’s a very short and cheap plane journey. I will be seeing him again in November, and it’s all I can think about. \n\nWhat I have done is now worse than anything my bf has ever done. But i think the continuous breaking my trust has whittled me down. Up until this point, I was always extremely loyal and was definitely more good than he deserved. Now I don’t have a leg to stand on, I don’t even really know what I want, and I don’t know what to do. We were planning to move out together as soon as I got a job and we had basically planned our whole lives together. I still love him of course, but I think my attraction for him faded a while ago, and just seems to fade more every time he does something. This is probably an underlying issue I have been avoiding for a while. It is something he has noticed too (and this was even before I met the new guy). I feel guilty and confused, and the new guy treats me like how I feel I deserve to be treated. I am very attracted to him and I am worried I will not be able to resist sleeping with him in November. But if I do, I will of course feel guilty. \n\nI have spoken to all my friends and even my mum about this. They all agree I should end it with my bf, although my mum thinks I should continue with my boyfriend for the time being because this is a stressful period for me, with my masters etc. She said it’s a shame the new guy doesn’t live closer, and that I should just “keep my eyes open” for other people. She also said I should not tell my bf about the situation, under any circumstances. \n\nSorry this is so long :/ I just feel lost and I’m pissed off that I was right about Porky all along and was gaslight about it. They have obviously cut off Pinky and Porky now, but as I said my boyfriend keeps making mistakes like these. \n\nNow I’m talking to this new guy, the relationship clearly isn’t sustainable anymore. I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t know if the relationship is worth trying to save, because I do still love him.

She says I'm not romantic enough, but I've been showing my love through actions. The two weeks we spent confined together in my small apartment have intensified this issue, and now I'm afraid of losing her.\n\n**Background:** We've been together for 1.5 years, and it's one of the best relationships of my life. We've talked about a future together, including buying land and building a home. Over our time together, we’ve traveled to Greece, been to a wedding, gone to the theater and cinema, and taken walks. I’ve bought her flowers occasionally and am always affectionate, trying to escalate touch and show my romantic side. I've been helping her with the renovation of her apartment, which I'm supposed to move into at the end of the month. We didn't have any major issues before this period.\n\n**The Recent Events:**\n\n* For the past two weeks, we've been living together in my small apartment because of her renovation. This was our second time living together for an extended period, but the first time was different—she was often away for work, so we had more space. This time we were confined together while she was on sick leave and I was working from home. This situation, combined with our personalities, intensified the feeling of being overstimulated.\n* A week ago, she told me I'm not romantic enough. This led to a more serious conversation where I opened up about my feelings, including a past situation that deeply hurt me. She apologized for her behavior, something I didn't expect, and assured me she doesn't want to change me and wants to stay with me because she loves me.\n* This morning, she told me she's afraid we'll burn out and that moving in together might not be a good idea right now. This was a shock to me because it was her idea from the beginning for me to move in. She thought it was silly for me to pay rent when we could live together. We had already talked through my initial skepticism, and I gave notice on my apartment a month ago. She knows I'm supposed to move in soon.\n* This triggered my fears, and I'm now afraid she wants to end things. I am struggling with overthinking, and I'm questioning if my fears are justified.\n\n**The Future:**\n\n* After the renovation is done, she will have a new job as a lecturer and will continue to run her private practice. I'll have my own room in her bigger apartment, giving us both more space and time for our own lives. I'll also be closer to my gym, so I'll be more focused on my own things. I believe this will help us balance our individual lives with our shared one.\n* I suggested a \"trial period\" for living together, during which we'll focus on giving each other more personal space and planning more romantic activities, like date nights. I want to show her that I can be both the reliable partner she needs and the romantic man she desires.\n\n**My question for you:** I'm looking for advice on how to navigate this crucial stage in our relationship. What are some effective ways to balance my practical nature with her need for romance? What steps can we take to make sure that moving in together strengthens our bond rather than weakening it?

{"id": "u/ChemistCurious6903_250", "user": "u/ChemistCurious6903", "text": "My gf is going to study and work abroad and I’m afraid of losing her\n\nHello, everyone. This is my very first time posting here. I will try to give you as much context as I can, because the situation I find myself in has become extremely complex for me and so mentally difficult and suffocating that I can’t deal with it anymore. I have been depressed for some months now and I am afraid that the worse is yet to come.\n\nOur story goes as follows. I (33m) met this girl (25f) through a dating app at the beginning of this year. I am currently living and working in Italy, though I am Mexican. My life before meeting her was not that bad but not that great either. I have a stable income and an otherwise quite dull life, which I had decided to keep until I decided that I had enough of this life experience and just go back to my country, since I have barely any friends and no family with me right now. One day, out of nowhere, I decided to try some luck changing my location in the dating app, specifically to Morocco. I found this girl, self-described as corporate, leading a quite normal life in her country. We matched and fell for each other almost instantly. There was a time in which we didn’t think too much about the possibilities of first meeting and then eventually closing the gap, since we were having some good time with each other. \n\nHowever, things escalated quickly. We were all over each other for months and it was clear that we were determined to make this work. I would sometimes get very serious when the topic meeting and closing the gap came up, stating that we needed to meet first to see how things went and then decide from there what to do. I remember telling her many times “Please, do not make any life-changing decisions before we meet”, a phrase that would then echo in my mind up until this day. \n\nLast April, I announced to her my intention to go meet her in her country during the summer break and she exploded in excitement. We were continuing with our relationship without any problems, organising video calls, even sleeping on the phone; it truly seemed like a dream. Until something happened.\n\nIn the past, she had expressed a very loose interest in going to France to study for then living and working there, eventually. She told me that those plans were shelved, since she had tried it but for some bureaucratic reasons, her contract (apprenticeship) got cancelled and she was left with a trauma. I thought in the back of my mind that she might still be wondering about that, hence the famous phrase that I have told you before. One day, out of nowhere, she dropped the news: she had decided to go study and work in France.\nIt was one of the worst days of my life. An avalanche of feelings came to me. I knew that I couldn’t tell not to do it, this had been her dream. On the other hand, it made me feel terrible because of several reasons. First, I felt left out since she didn’t even spoke with me about it, she just decided by herself. Second, reaching her would have become extremely difficult since I would have practically no chances of moving there (I do speak the language but getting a company to sponsor the visa is extremely difficult). Third, I admit it, it touched my pride in some way. She is going to be getting a second Masters of 1 year while potentially leading to much better career prospects for her. I am really happy that she could achieve all of this, but I feel that this was a breaking point, with her eventually evolving away from me.\n\nAfter I expressed my feelings, she insisted on trying to pursue a relationship like this, since we were very deep in love with each other. Although I agreed, the damage was done. I suffer from clinical depression episodes and this had triggered one, probably one of the worst I have ever experienced. The relationship dynamics changed. I lost my cool, my mental peace, but tried to make it seem that I was okay. She was fully aware of this and provided me with her support. However, things were slowly and progressively getting worse. Every time I had an update about her process, I would get extremely sad. She applied to a business school in Paris, got admitted right away. Then she searched for apprenticeship positions (she could do this thing of alternating this apprenticeship with university courses and still get her degree after one year) and she didn’t had any difficulty finding one, a very good one in the headquarters of a multinational company in the outskirts of Paris.\nI felt completely crushed, because I felt that I was being left behind in everything, in career, ambition and this relationship. \n\nMy mental health was at an all-time-low. Even though we still loved each other and could spend some really great moments, discussions became more and more frequent, to the point of severely affecting our relationship. I decided that I didn’t want to drag her down and that I needed to accept the reality and proposed to still meet her, just to not have any regrets. Initially I saw this meeting as a potential goodbye, since for me it was getting difficult to accept what she was going to do. Therefore we met a couple of days ago in Morocco.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe me that it was the most amazing time of my life. Right after we met, we felt that we had known each other for years. It truly felt like not only I was with my girlfriend, but also with my soulmate, the one I had been looking for. In her words, that trip “saved our relationship”, since neither of us wanted to end things after what happened. We made another difficult decision: to continue pursuing this relationship even after all of what happened.\n\nHowever, I don’t know how to deal with what’s coming or if will be able to do so. I have some many fears: Will that experience change her? Will she get over me after what she will be living? And you might be wondering, what about closing the gap? This is the most difficult part and one we have discussed again and again and there is no clear answer. We explored all options: her country, my country, but none of those seem to convince her. She wants to take things one step at a time. This means that she will do this one year thing and then she will decide. She told me that if she doesn’t like it, she is likely to follow me, but recently, she admitted that living and working in Paris (or almost in Paris) is a dream to her. She told me that if she does things right, she will get offered the full-time position. Yet again, she affirms that her decision to stay remains in whether she likes the experience or not.\n\nIf I decided to pursue this, I will be in the limbo for at least a year, waiting to know if she likes it or not. I definitely want her to do this, she tells me that she wants to live this life for a while but also that she doesn’t want to lose me. The uncertainty of this is killing me. My fears are all eating me up. I am now having therapy sessions and will start getting on antidepressants to cope with all of this. I do believe that this woman is worth it, she is everything I had dreamed of, but I’m afraid she won’t be the same, that she will evolve away from me, that she will become unreachable and that this will be the tragic end of a love story that could have been perfect.\n\nIf you have made it all the way here, I appreciate your time and your attention.\nPlease let me know your thoughts.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We were sitting next to each other at a cafe. She had just graduated high school. We were both in San Francisco at the time, which is where her family lives and where I go to college. I got her number and we went on 4 dates between June and August of 2024. When summer ended, she had to leave SF to start her freshman year at university in New York City.\n\nWhen she left, we agreed to visit each other but made no formal commitments as we weren’t sure how a long distance relationship could work. Over the next 2 months, I visited her three times in new york for 3 long weekends. After deliberating back and forth, we eventually decided on become official after the third Visit in November 2024. We stayed long distance throughout the next 9 months of the school year with 1 visit every ~2 months, including a month long visit to SF during winter break.\n\nThis last summer (June 2025 - August 2025), she came back to SF again and we were able to spend 3 days a week together like last year. I met her family and we grew closer, and then she left a few weeks ago.\n\nHere’s the problem: I don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to be in person together permanently, at least not in the near future. It’s definitely not impossible, but it’s not guaranteed either. I have a job lined up for next summer as an investment banker here in San Francisco, while she wants to stay in NYC for art opportunities. That means we probably won’t get to spend summer together like in 2024 and 2025. After that, my hope is to get a return offer to work full time in SF and then eventually change offices to NYC after my first 6-12 months of work in SF to be with her in NYC. That’s a minimum of 2.5-3 more years of long distance, with no guarantee I’ll be able to lateral to NYC in that timeframe.\n\nThere’s a possibility she could end up working an art gig here in SF, but I know her dream is to work in NYC and she’ll still be in college there for another 3 years. I am very much in love with my girlfriend and I absolutely see her by my side in the very long term, if circumstances would permit it. I’m just not sure if it’s realistic to keep pouring our hearts into this with no certainty for the future and such a long time horizon ahead of us.\n\nTL;DR — I have a minimum of 3 more years before i’ll be able to live with my LDR girlfriend of 15 months, with no set-in-stone guarantees.

I love my girlfriend (F31) with everything I have — she’s kind, patient, and the most important person in my life. We’ve been together almost 3 years and built a life where our families know each other, we’ve traveled together, and we spend nearly all our time intertwined. She’s the love of my life, and I don’t want to lose her.\n\nBut lately, I feel completely exhausted and weighed down. I’m back in college, buried in responsibilities at home, and constantly stretched too thin. She needs me around often for comfort and companionship, and even though I want to be there, I just don’t have the time or energy I used to. We’ve been fighting more, making up, and then falling back into the same cycle. I keep trying to change and improve, but it feels like I’m never enough. I know she’s also trying in her own way, but the slow progress has me drained and hopeless at times.\n\nIn the middle of this, I met someone new at school (F25). I didn’t want it to happen, but over months I developed a real crush on her. I even confessed recently — she turned me down — but the feelings are still there. With her, things felt easy and freeing in a way I haven’t felt in a long time, and that scared me because I don’t want to betray my girlfriend. Now I feel guilty, ashamed, and like the worst partner.\n\nI don’t want to leave my girlfriend. I want to fight for what we have. But I also can’t deny how lost and conflicted I feel. I know I should be honest with her, but I’m terrified of hurting her or breaking what we’ve built.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Should I admit the crush to my girlfriend, or focus on telling her how overwhelmed and burnt out I am first?\n\n\n2. How do I handle these feelings ethically without destroying her trust?\n\n\n3. What concrete steps (boundaries, therapy, communication changes) should I take right now to stop this from spiraling further?\n\n\n4. For those who’ve been in similar situations — how do you rebuild closeness when you’re this emotionally drained?\n\n\n\nI know this post is long and messy, but this is me at my rawest. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: I (M25) love my girlfriend (F31) of nearly 3 years, but I’m exhausted from school, responsibilities, and relationship strain. I developed a crush on someone at school (F25), confessed, and got rejected — but the feelings are still there. I feel ashamed and want to save my relationship, but don’t know if I should confess or how to handle this without destroying what we have.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I've had a lot of situationships in the past, but I got out of a 3-year relationship earlier this year and I feel like I'm back to Level 1 of dating.\n\nAs I said in the title, I met this guy in July via OmegleMe. We connected instantly and talked for almost 3 hours that night. We then connected via Telegram, eventually moved to WhatsApp, and hasn't stopped since then. We'd talk everyday about all sorts of things — work, family, music, faith. I feel like I can share everything with him, and he said he feels the same. He doesn't connect to people right away, so he was surprised that he's opening up with me.\n\nWe started having regular movie nights almost every single day. I'm 6 hours ahead of him but my office follows his timezone so we end up calling after our work. After watching a movie, we'd hang around and talk about other things. The call would sometimes last up to 6 or 7 hours, and we both end up whispering sweet nothings to each other while in bed, saying how sweet each others' voices are and how we wish we're not so far apart.\n\nWe talked about our expectations early on. He said that even though he has developed feelings for me, he know he isn't ready for a relationship yet. I wasn't looking for a relationship too, but I guess the difference is that he's put a period on us, while I'm open for something that could develop in the future.\n\nAnd that happened. My feelings developed, and even though his feelings developed too, he didn't want to act on it.\n\nI tried ending things two weeks ago, but I couldn't. Last night, I did it with so much hesitation and tears. I cried while speaking to him, and he did too. He said he won't stop me because doing so would be so selfish.\n\nI miss him so much. I was in a meeting earlier and had to turn my camera off as I couldn't stop crying. I badly want to reach out, but I don't think I should. I've been anxious for weeks due to a lot of reasons, but I feel like the situationship was contributing to it, too. I'm trying to clear the other things now and taking medications to lower my cortisol levels and have a clearer mind.\n\nOnce I have more clarity and my feelings subside, I'm thinking we could continue talking just as friends and implement stricter boundaries in the relationship, but the rational part of myself things this idea is foolish and I'd end up crying again if I do it. But for some reason, I feel like there's more to this connection, that I'm not done with it and him yet. Not necessarily in a romantic context, but maybe with a different purpose? But of course, this could just be my emotions running high.\n\nI usually had no issues leaving a situation I am done with.

Was I being unreasonable?\n\nSo this morning, I (28M) was casually discussing dating red flags with a new girl I'm seeing (26F). We've only been dating for a couple of months, so we were talking about boundaries and what we look for in a partner. I mentioned that I think it's a red flag if a girl is still in contact with her ex, because it means that she hasn't moved on, and is leaving the door open for future reconciliation. Therefore, I would be concerned about committing to a girl who still has ties to her ex, as I don't want to deal with the possibility that she still has feelings for him, or that her ex would try to sabotage the new relationship somehow. After hearing this, she ended up admitting to me that she still follows her ex even though they broke up a few years ago. She said that she's fully over him, but she didn't unfollow him because he rarely posts, and she didn't want him to think that she was trying to get his attention by unfollowing.\n\nWe ended up having a pretty long discussion about this topic, and I explained to her in a lot of detail why I felt like it was unhealthy to still follow an ex, and that it would be disrespectful to her new partner even if she didn't have any lingering feelings. I told her that I cut off all my exes after we break up, and therefore I'd hold my partner to the same standard. She said that she understood my perspective, and then promptly unfollowed her ex as a result (I don't know his username but I saw her following count go down). She wasn't mad or anything, she just said her ex didn't matter to her, and she didn't want this to be an issue in the future, so she decided to remove him on socials.\n\nAfter she unfollowed him, for some reason I felt a bit guilty that I had pressured her into doing that. I guess I didn't expect her to just comply without any argument, and I also don't want to come off as insecure or jealous. We're exclusively dating, but since we aren't technically official yet, I don't have any right to tell her to unfollow someone. I don't want to be seen as a controlling boyfriend in the future, and I'm worried that I crossed a line, even if she had no problem unfollowing him after I told her that it made me uncomfortable.

Do I stay or go?\n\nI’ve been with my girlfriend for 8 years (we’re 25M/24F). We had a few short breakups early on in university due to immaturity on my end, but never cheating. I hooked up with other girls during that time, she stayed loyal. Since then, we’ve lived together, moved across the country for my dream, and later back home for hers. I hoped to move back together in a few years.\n\nHere’s the problem: I feel like I do everything for her. Cooking, cleaning, little gifts, making her life easier daily. I consider her in everything I do and at times have lived to make her life easier and better. I’ve also been in therapy for 5 years, worked on myself, and grown a lot emotionally. She wants me to stay because she knows I’m a very good partner to her though I have my flaws like anyone else. I don’t feel like she’s a good partner to me however.\n\nI’ve encouraged her to do therapy and heal and take care of herself (so she can then learn how to take care of me), and she’s only just now starting this process.\n\nBut she doesn’t consider me the way I consider her. She rarely compliments me, doesn’t try to make me feel attractive (though I get attention from other girls here and there-I only want it from her), doesn’t do the little things that show effort or appreciation. On top of that, she people-pleases in social situations and sometimes puts me down to lift others up. Or just chooses to please others over me all together. She admits this but hasn’t figured out how to stop yet.\n\nAfter 8 years, I’m just drained. I love her, but I don’t feel seen or valued. I keep wondering: if I haven’t felt confident enough to propose by now, is that my gut telling me this isn’t right? I’ve talked to some older guys some divorced and some not. They have basically said if it’s a dealbreaker leave. But I’m scared. My whole life I feel like has been with her. I don’t know anything else. Im scared of the pain the hurt maybe the mistake of leaving. Do I leave and find a partner who meets me halfway? I feel like there might be someone who is better to me. But maybe she can learn? It’s so hard to know.\n\nThere are lot of context here so ask way.

In the duration of the pregnancy announcement and us separating after a very intense and rocky relationship it’s understandable that she’ll be more on the emotional side of things which i completely understand. I’ve been very respectful with the boundaries she’s set, not wanting to overstep in anyway and to make things as stress free and easy as i can.

I’d like to add that on top of her pregnancy she’s also anemic and most likely will be doing treatments/surgeries for her recently diagnosed skin cancer as well. I’ve offered countless times to help around with mundane things she’d normally do like clean up the house for her top to bottom, cook meals, care for her siblings, pets, maybe even take over her babysitting job temporarily so that she can simply rest and focus on just being energized for when she has strength to do things on her own, but she refuses. she tells me she’ll let me know or downright ignores the request and gives me a cold shoulder. Not only that, if i ask for updates on how she’s feeling on everything alone her responses are very generic and short with “i’m okay” or “i’m good” etc.\n\nI know she has a lot going on, she’s the strongest woman i know, and i love her deeply, but i feel hurt that she’s so closed off and shutting me out when all i want is to help her and to be present not only for our unborn but for her as well. I feel selfish and pathetic for even feeling hurt when she has it worse than me but i’m desperate for her to communicate because it’s truly killing me and i wouldn’t want this to be the foundation we start our journey on as individuals who will be parents soon.

She’s asked me about my dating preferences several times and joked that they better not exclude her. She’s complimented my appearance and compared me to celebrities she’s “in love” with. When I told her something about someone that broke my heart she inserted herself into that situation as a “I wouldn’t have”. Another time on a similar note I talked about a past relationship and she said “I would have loved to be her”. She plays tricks on me with male friends and when I ask her why she literally says “I wanted to see your reaction”. We traded songs a couple times and a couple of hers were super heavy handed, I retaliated by also picking some that were obviously supposed to be about her and she said she loved one of them. I’m often openly flirty and she hasn’t called me on it.\n\nBut on the other hand, she says we’re FRIENDS. Like 9000 times, unprompted. A weird amount of times. She is flirty generally, I think. I somewhat suspect something is going on with her and someone else but she has told me that it isn’t and then been at different times been vague about it.\n\nSo, is it fair for me to feel like she’s at a minimum giving mixed signals? Or am I projecting what I want into it and she’s totally being normal.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Then he moved back to my city for work. We kinda started dating but it was always not so serious. In my life I always had some abroad plans so when we started dating, we thought that we only start this because we can’t control our emotions and can’t keep being friends only and at some point of my life i might go to a very far country that he might not able to come (but my initial abroad plan was cancelled because i didn’t got a scholarship that i need so we dated in the same city for years). \n\nAfter a year of dating, i started to be the person in the relationship that requests more attention (after the honeymoon phase ended). Somehow we managed to still stay in a relationship for 3 years even though we broke up for short whiles due to some fights related to us not fit each other that much or him not giving me girlfriend attention (only giving wholesome friend type of attention). \n\nLast year I moved in a different city for studies but i was visiting once in 3 weeks so we didn’t have a long period that we didn’t see each other. And he visited my city once (me coming to his place was much easier and economic than him coming to my city as i don’t have anywhere to host him) \n\n\nThis year I moved to a different country temporarily for 6 months. In 2 weeks ill go back to my country actually. In these 6 months we never met as i didn’t go back to my country and he didn’t come to the country i live now (he didn’t put much effort to get a visa even tho we were talking about him coming and us traveling together) \nthe first 2 months I was trying to have online calls and dates so that we still have a bond. When I invited him to these he was joining and having fun. But later on, my life in this country got more and more busy and I didn’t invite him to anything online. He also didn’t do it so many weeks passed without having contact other than short texts. As time passed I also got more distant to him and valued my friends and life in this new country more so i wasn’t nagging him much about the lack of communication. At some point I mentioned him that we got more distant and he agreed. He told me that he doesn’t know why it happened and he was joking that (as if talking about a business plan) “well we need to take action about this issue” when i asked him how he feels about this. Usually he has a personality that doesn’t share his emotions and jokes to change the topic or the focus of the question. \nI was talking this with my therapist also and I was telling her how he doesn’t show me attention. My therapist told me that I need to openly tell him that I need attention so I did, I called him and we had a convo about attention and I asked him “I want this from a boyfriend, can you give me the attention I need?” and he said “I am not sure if I can give the amount of attention you want, my personality isn’t like that and if I fake it, you’ll understand and it will be not genuine” and we decided to think more about this and not decide anything now. \n\nRecently I had another session with my therapist and she told me that how I describe attention might be different from someone else as it can be a vague term. So she wanted me to describe it. This made sense for me and I asked the same thing to him on text. I told him “my therapist mentioned this and that blablabla so, how do you describe attention?” \nhe responded me like “how i describe attention?” “I think we both know what attention means and we dont need to have this conversation” I just sent sad emoji face to that and he said “ I dont know its just we dont have anything to talk about and i find it difficult to do small talk and show attention, its like we’re very distant” and then i told that “okay nevermind i just asked because we talked this with my doctor so i wanted to ask you before i forget” \nand then he said “im sorry, are you okay?” and i said i am okay. so that was our last texts and i dont think we’re gonna talk much later \n\n\nthe thing is as he is a close friend and a boyfriend for such a long time i feel like he was the right person for me and he was sweet when we were not long distance. So im not sure if we live in the same city and get along well everything will be okay? or should i see this as a sign that he is not really into me anymore? what does it tell about a person that is mostly a good boyfriend when you are together but doesn’t do much to keep the spark alive when you are apart?\n\ntl;dr: We are an OKAY couple when we are in the same city but during long distance he stopped giving attention.

TLTR, but its for better context.\n\nI (26M) have been in a relationship with my current girl (21F) for 2 yrs now but recently it seems like she’s drawing back. She was all lovey dovey, sending poems, random selfies, snaps and video flashes all along until recently. \n\nApparently  I got an opportunity to work abroad and I couldn’t let that slide. I told her we shud breakup bcos I dont do LDR but she insisted that we dont have to break up and promised to wait for me, I thought why not and we kept the ball rolling. \n\nI left for the abroad work just weeks after our first anniversary and everything was on smoothly until the last 3 months I notice she’s drawing back on most of the thigh she would do to keep things interesting snc its a LDR, it’s like she’s second guessing. It even gets worse day by day because I told her my contract will be extended and I wont be back soon as she expected. (The initial contract was 1yr but it got extended by a yr)\n\nAt one point on video call she told me, and I quote “I love the way you love me now unlike before when you used to act ‘gangster’. I asked what do you mean I used to act gangster- she responded with “ when you were here you acted like you never cared about me, always did things your way and had other girls having your attention while I did everything for you”. Then it dawned on me that it’s the ‘gangster’ version she wanted to please and love.   \n\nI notice my flaw is that I may have given her too much attention (like watering a flower to death) to appoint that she confirms that she likes the way I love her now, unlike the time I was ‘gangster-like’. But in my opinion, I thought the LDR would be kept alive by consistent communication and attending to her emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, efforts were mutual snc she had her ways of spicing things up despite the distance. Some time back, her mother came across our chats and she scolded her for the naughty chats, videos and pics she was sending to me. She actually says she was told to stop contacting me but we’ve been in contact every day. Apparently she feels shy and ashamed of spicing things up because of the incident. \n\nOff late the conversations are drying up, and the efforts look forced. And here is where I need your advice:\n1.

How can I reverse the situation to the ‘gangster version’ whilst in a LDR?\n2. Is there away to save this?

He is in a rigorous residency program where he is working 80+ hours a week and even when he comes home for the day, continues to work until he only gets 5 hours of sleep. So 19 hours of his day are committed to his job. He still makes it a priority to text and call me and lets me know when he’ll be busy and can’t talk. I just have a normal job at the moment and I don’t work Fridays, so I am available to come see him on weekends. I understand not going to see him when he has to work that weekend, but even on the weekends he doesn’t work, I’m not able to go. We have talked in depth about this and he says he wants to have quality time together, he doesn’t want to be stressed about working and me being there at the same time. He’s worried I will feel like I’m being used just for physical things then he gets back to work. On his weekends he does typically work all day Saturday/Sunday even if he isn’t actually going into work. I am about 10 hours away, his family only about 2. So he has seen his family a few times. And I have asked him, why can you make time for them but not for me? (But worried less weird than that) and he says he has a family event for an hour or two then gets back to work at their house. I have told him many times how I don’t care about him working , that I’ll come and just get whatever time I can with him.

We never make out. The last time we made out for more than 5 minutes was 2-3 months in the relationship, she said at the time that she didn't want it to transition to intimate thing so I reassured her, she made an effort for a few weeks but now if we make out for more than 30 seconds she tells that she wants to do something else.

When I told her about what she had told she said that she has a lower sex drive and that I can sacrifice my part sometimes since she can't have hers as often. \n\n4. No sex. 8 months without sex, she is not a virgin, she is not fresh off a toxic relationship or anything, she has had sex with every ex and earlier, at 5 months she dropped the news that she wants to wait to have sex with me. Let's look at her excuses:\n\"It creates irritations\" so the routine with every other ex didn't?\n\"It takes a lot of time and I want to enjoy my weekend\" she sleeps on average 32 hours ok weekdays cause she has to wake up at 7:00 (8:00 if online) and plays videogames from 21:00-1:00+ cause she needs them for her mental health (I play with her but now with my work too I won't stay as late now).\n\"I enjoy other stuff more\" thanks for telling that would have meant never sex in the very start (never said anything).\n\"You said that sex means love and closeness to you so it changed my perspective\" doesn't that contradict each one of the previous points?\nI am not gonna force her to do it, I would never, but I want that physical closeness with my partner and yes sex is important for me which I made clear at the start.\n\n5. Things changed from the start. She always gets offended when I say this cause she says that her exes said it too. In the first few months she used to pull me into her room to make out, ask me to do her cause making out turned her on and saying she wanted me before getting on top of me before rubbing herself on me. Now she doesn't wanna make out and never makes me feel like she is turned on cause of me, just urged.\n\nWhen I bring all this up to her, if she doesn't wanna accept it I'll try to get her best friend in on it too since they 100% agree with me. If not, well I'll guess I'll be single.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

My long distance boyfriend (29) and I (28) have been dating for 2 years online. He lives in the UK and I live in the US. We’ll be meeting each other for the first time, finally, in person at the end of November. Im excited but also nervous. Everything’s been great except for the fact that he has a girl best friend who he knew before me. He also met her online but through gaming and he actually met up with her one on one back in July for the first time in London. Which seems like a lot to go travel on a train to see another woman for an entire day even if it’s his best friend. But he texted me the entire time to calm my nerves which did help a little. However I still feel super nervous about his friendship with her. I will say my last relationship ended because my ex cheated on me with our close friend. So I do feel like I have trauma with female friends. The girl and him are in a gaming group together that gets together once a week for a raid. They also share a smaller group chat with 2-3 other guys where she’s the only girl. Recently, I found that he has liked almost every pic she’s posted on IG since when they met, as well as posts on her second account. These pics range from her in ball gowns at a book con event to her bending for a golf shot in a mini skirt. I’ve confronted him about how I feel and he denies there being anything. But I can’t help but think he’s telling me what I want to hear. She’s objectively pretty and has stuff in common w him that I can’t connect with him about (games, pokemon, etc). She has a discord server which he openly told me he is in. The thing that does settle me is that she is married. However, he mentioned them having relationship issues which made me wonder how deep their talks are. It also doesn’t just worry me that he’s going to cheat on me with her but that more so he’s lusting after her/wants what he can’t have. I get dark thoughts where he thinks about her instead of me a lot of the time.. and I sometimes feel like he’s with me out of convenience. Outside of this though he’s been amazing to be with. He’s super supportive, caring, thoughtful.. but when his girl best friends name comes up, it feels different. Am I overreacting to be upset about him liking all of his girl best friends photos?

I've since changed my point of view - I don't think she has any interest in making her own efforts to change.

It's been functioning well so far, however, since we are becoming more and more serious, we started thinking about closing the distance. \n\nThe main issue is that nobody wants to move, we both have good reasons to stay, both objective and subjective. My reasoning is that she will find a job much easier here, than me there, since I'm a teacher and in my country it's very difficult to find a steady teaching job, I can't work as a substitute all the time and not knowing if someone will need me tomorrow. Also, I have a whole house for my self that I inherited from my grandma. My parents and I have been renovating it specifically for me. If I were to move, we'd either have to live with her parents or rent or buy our own place and be in debt for the next 30 years... I don't think she understand what kinda luxury nowadays is to have your own house, debt free... Also I have more land, we also have a house woth a vineyard in the hills etc. \n\nEvery time I mention the possibility of her moving here, she gets really down and starts crying, saying how she is very bonded to her town and region and how it would mentally be very difficult for her. Thing is, I am quite the same, so I understand her point of view, but idk what else to tell her than say it's the same for me. \n\nFor anyone who was in a similar situation, how did you solve it? Did you break up, did you manage to come to an agreement? Any advice is appreciated. \n\nBtw, we talked about a compromise that we both move, but that's difficult since...

Thank you in advance!!\n\nSo this is my first relationship an ldr nonetheless and I personally feel our relationship lacks “sexual” intimacy amongst intimacy in general. We talk, text, and game online together daily and the most flirty/ spicy thing we had done was masturbating over the phone twice in the first month (She wasn’t comfortable so we stopped) and occasional “join me in the shower” texts. \n\nOur relationship (4 months now) has been defined as “talking” until she recently met me in person. We didn’t have sex this time which I’m not stressed about but was hoping the second time we meet in another month or two that we would. Most we did was a long hug and my hand on her thigh during a movie. \n\nIt has been like pulling teeth to get her to agree to occasional selfies and video calls twice a week (I’d prefer daily video calls but compromised on twice weekly). She is insecure in her body and I do my best to reassure her.\n\nIs this normal and I just need more patience? I feel like in person couples boink in the first month (not that I need that).

Both of our profiles said we were looking for a long-term relationship. From the start, he was very complimentary about my looks, and I told him I wanted to make sure he knew I wasn’t looking to mess around. He  said he understood and that he was genuinely into me. \n\nOn our first date, he drove an hour and a half to take me out to dinner. We had amazing chemistry, and ended up hooking up. It was great- I hadn’t had sex in months, and I wanted to. The next day he texted saying I was “amazing” and “worth an even longer drive.” He drove down again the next week — we spent about 8 hours together, had dinner, watched a movie, and hooked up again. We were texting every day — flirty, affectionate texts as well as just daily check-ins and references to things we’d do together. If I felt like I was too excited over text, he’d promise me that he didn’t want me to be more chill and that we were mutually ‘not chill’ about the connection. \n\nWe then went two weeks without seeing each other as I worked nights. We had plans for a Saturday, and I let him know that my plans Friday had changed and asked if he wanted to hang out both days. Out of nowhere, he texted: “What would you say the end goal with us is?” I asked him to call, and on the phone he said he’s had a hard time with relationships, doesn’t want commitment, and doesn’t want to lead me on if he isn’t 100% sure it’ll go somewhere.  He told me he thinks I’m amazing, that he isn’t seeing anyone else, but “pretty much knows it won’t turn serious” and didn’t want to hurt me.\n\nI told him I wasn’t asking him to be my boyfriend or marry me — I just wanted to keep spending time together and see where it goes. But he went back and forth, wouldn’t commit one way or the other, and basically ended it.\n\nHere’s what I can’t wrap my head around:\n   •   Why would someone who pursued me, texted me every day, and said such affectionate things suddenly panic when I suggested seeing each other two nights in a row?\n   •   Why say you’re looking for long-term on your profile, but then bail when it starts to feel real?\n   •   Do guys like this actually mean all the sweet things they say, or is it just in the moment?\n\nI know it was only a month, but I’m left feeling sick, embarrassed, and confused about what went wrong.

We’ve known each other for a long time but I’m starting to doubt his feelings. I feel like I’ve been waiting for too long and he’s not really thinking about our future together. He’s unemployed and I’m working overseas. We’ve been LDR for 3 years and plan to see each other by the end of this year. My friends are saying that he might propose this time but I know he’s not ready for marriage yet. I do want him to be my husband in the future but he’s not the “partner” that I need in life as of the moment. I’m hoping he’ll still change but time is running out - I am diagnosed with severe PCOS and my OB advised me to have children soon before 35 or else I should give up on having kids.\n\nI do love him but this LDR thing is driving me nuts. In the back of my mind, I would rather die single than keep being on this situation. My love language is physical touch and him is words of affirmation. Imagine how hard it is for me being so far away and not feel his “love”. I was even diagnosed with major depression because of this. 😔\n\nI kept on telling him my feelings and what I want him to do but I also don’t want to be a “nagger”. I feel so bad because he’s trying. He has a lot of potential but I don’t really know what to do anymore to motivate and support him. He said that I should just be there for him but is it really enough? I honestly think he’ll be the best version of himself without me in his life. (I stayed for 15 years and nothing happened. Maybe the problem is me, right? 😭) I can’t help but think that I might NOT be the one  that he needs on his side. 🥹😭\n\nSo here’s my question: Should I end things with him after our trip (at least I’ll be able to say my feelings personally) or just do it online prior and just cancel our plans? If you were on my shoes, how will you break up with someone who’s been with you half of your life?

Nothing crazy, but enough to say I have my experience. I have never in my life felt the same way about someone this early on as I do with her. I feel like a teenager again. Seriously makes me reconsider my past relationships.\n\nHow do you guys who have been in these situations even handle these feelings? I’ll be at work and she will just pop into my mind. I’ll be cooking food and I’ll just be thinking about her. Sometimes it’s all I can think about\n\nIm not the love bomb type but I feel like half the time we are having a conversation I just want to give her a hug. How do I care about someone this much this early on?\n\nNow the second question of the post:\n\nShe has invited me to a few group hangouts with other people that we know from the gym. During these hangouts, her and I keep it very lowkey. Only a few of her friends know that we are seeing eachother and we don’t really show a lot of affection. I genuinely believe the majority have no clue. Part of this I believe is due to one of her good guy friends being obsessed with her. He’s been friend-zoned a few times but I don’t think the reality has fully hit him yet. \n\nIt’s a weird situation but it’s also exciting because I have never experienced it. We will go from acting like we hardly know when there is a room full of people to these incredibly flirty moments that feel like we are just releasing all these bottled up emotions when we have to room to ourselves. It fascinates me.\n\nHave any of you guys experienced these things? And how would you go about it moving forward. I’m sure as time goes on her friends will become aware of what’s happening, or we will tell just tell them. But her taking over my brain is insane. Maybe I’ve just never really liked someone as much as I thought I did, until I met her.\n\nThanks for reading and your advice!", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

On paper, everything is amazing: we laugh a lot, never fight, we live together really well, intimacy is good, and our lives fit together almost perfectly. I love her a lot — my life is truly better because of her presence.\n\nThe problem is that for the past year, I’ve been feeling a constant doubt. I miss a certain spark or sense of attraction. For example, when we talk about booking vacations or making future plans, I sometimes feel resistance rather than excitement. It’s confusing, because I know how good we are together, yet I can’t shake this feeling.\n\nWe’ve already tried a lot: I’ve seen a psychologist to see if it was something personal, we’ve done relationship coaching, and even took a 2-month time-out living separately under guidance of the coach. We communicate well about it, and we both don’t want to throw away something that works. But the doubt just doesn’t go away.\n\nOne thing to note is that I’ve never been in another long-term relationship before, and I’m kind of scared the same thing would happen with anyone else in the future.\n\nAnother factor: we own a house together. Breaking up would mean selling or moving out, which is a huge financial and practical hurdle. That makes the decision feel even more final, even though I know it shouldn’t be any factor.\n\nPart of me thinks: this is just what long-term relationships are, the “in love” feeling fades. But another part of me thinks: if I haven’t felt “yes, this is it” for almost a year, maybe that’s telling me something important.\n\nI’m torn between staying (and risking that this doubt will always linger), or ending it (and risking regret because I’d be giving up someone amazing).\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How did you decide whether the absence of spark was something you could live with, or a sign to move on?\n\n**TL;DR:** Been with my girlfriend (25F) for 5.5 years (me 29M). Relationship is great on paper (no fights, good intimacy, fun together), and I love her a lot, but I’ve been doubting for about a year because I miss the spark/attraction. We tried therapy, coaching (including a 2-month break guided by a coach), but the doubt doesn’t go away. We also own a house together, which makes breaking up feel like a huge and final step.

At first it was strictly platonic. I had a crush on a guy and it wasn't going well. This guy really helped me deal with that and other stuff. Just a really good friend. Then somehow we started flirting and exchanging explicit photos and messages. Eventually I developed some feelings for him and realized that around May or June. In August he told me he's dating a woman, but they're not exclusive and they both don't want commitment. Since they're not exclusive I decided to tell him I like him. He made weird boundaries, like explicit messages would be crossing boundaries but he still likes my explicit pictures and call me hot etc. Yesterday I've sent him a Tiktok that said something like \"praying for people who think you can have a true connection with someone you met online and never met in real life\". I've sent it more as a joke and he took it seriously and said that I \"needed that 10000000%\". It made me sad, his behavior in general makes me upset since he's giving me a lot of mixed signals.

{"id": "u/soundisamazing_772", "user": "u/soundisamazing", "text": "My 31m father 68m has never shown care towards me, not sure if I should cut him off or not\n\nHi, my father has some very deep rooted issues and it has impacted me tremendously through my life. It caused me to hate him for a long time, and when I tried to approach it at an older age (30) to fix our relationship, it flooded back to me and caused me a lot of pain, becuase he is incapable of changing.\n\nTo start, my dad was always \"there\" physically, but never emotionally. My mom did absolutely everything despite them both working full time. She cooked, cleaned, took 3 kids to and from school, to and from sports, signed us up, payed attention to our needs and met them. I was diagnosed diabetic at 9, a disease that needs basically 24/7 care by parents at that age before you can do it yourself, my mom learned everything my dad did nothing. If I was dying on the ground, he wouldnt know what to do and would call my mom for help. Never talked to me about how its going being a child with diabetes. He didnt help me move into adult hood, no advice, no career help or post secondary guidance, I was very talented at many things but he never once asked me about it. He basically checked out completely.\n\nI went through some mental health issues last year and sat my parents down and told them im having scary thoughts and am pretty worried about my well being. I finished that sentence, he said \"im going to bed\". My mom does not stand up for me when things like this happen. She went through the same thing with him I assume.\n\nWhen I bring these things up to him, he has a different story in his head. Its never his fault even when there is factual evidence. He explained him leaving the mental health conversation as \"I thought you and mom would have a more meaningful convo about it so I wanted to let you be in private\". Never his fault.\n\nThis year ive tried breaching the topic and talking to him about all of this. He rejected it. Made it into my problem. For about 6 months we had discussions and 6 months of him telling me im crazy and making things up. My sister comes in and says im not making this up because she feels the same. Only then did he apologized for not being there for us growing up and how things will change from now on. So for years I have been talking about this stuff, seriously for 6 months and he knew exactly what I was saying, yet still decided to make me feel like a problem, and make me feel crazy, putting the blame on me when he knew it wasnt the case. Absolutely terrible thing to do to someone if you ask me.\n\nSo he wanted to have weekly talks with me to mend the relationship finally, after me trying to do this for years. I allowed him to schedule these because its not my responsibility to hold his hand through a problem he created, and made me feel like it was my fault for it my whole life. We did 2 talks, then he stopped bothering with them. He made a million excuses why he cant. These excuses did not make sense logically. Just total delusion. When I get upset about him letting me down, Its now my issue again. He said \"in my mind things have changed a lot\" and \"I didnt put as much importance on these talks as you because I knew they would eventually keep happening\". Absolute avoidance of every issue at hand. He has convinced himself one apology is enough to fix a life time of things, he feels better about it, case closed for him. No thought about how anyone else feels around him.\n\nWe had one last talk the other day and I blew up at him completely. He is a very bad person for making me feel like a problem my whole life, everything is my fault, then apologizing and admitting his faults once, then turning around on that and making me feel its my fault again. Every time we talked and I explained how I felt, his response was \"thats not true\" and \"thats not under my control\". I say things as clear as 2+2=4 and he says \"thats not true\" even after Ive proven it to be true and everyone around agrees. I told him I need to give up because this is eating me alive, and his response was \"lets call it a truce\". Now our whole family dynamic is harmed because we cannot be in the same room as eachother. Again making me feel like this is my doing because if I didnt breach the topic, things would be as they were. Silent resentment but liveable.\n\nI dont know where to go other than cutting him off completely. That means he gets to be at family events being fine with everyone and I need to avoid them. I have so much hatred that I need to let go of for my own well being. Any advice here?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I  REALLY need advice.\n\nWe've been together for almost 4 years now. At the beginning, I was dating him because he was a good boy. By this I mean, he would not be like other fuckboys. He wanted a relationship and not just sex. He was not into the partying, drinking, football, violent sports, etc. He's a feminist. He's a vegetarian like me. And our ethics and morals and thoughts about minorities align with each other. I thought that I made a very good choice of a partner. He used to treat me nicely and would be attentive and I used to compliment him on this. In household there is constant screaming. We don't have current water nor much electricity. So I pretty much live with him and his family now. (Been doing it for almost a year and I feel guilty). We have been arguing almost every day more and more. And I'm just not happy with the life I have. He still doesn't have his driver's license. I beg for him to work out. And he doesn't. He’s lazy and not productive and smokes too much weed.\n\nYesterday we argued a lot. I said he was rude to me all day. He said it was vc I was rude first. Which in some cases I was. We were playing a boardgame with his sibilings. His sister was talking to me about smt we both like so I didn’t realise his brother was explaining his move. I kept talking to her and then my bf told me to stfu. What made me go crazy was that when I tried to explain my feelings then he started saying that I overreacted. The argument went back and forth in a circle. And I ended up being very self-destructive. Saying horrible things. And he told me that I was performative. I literally wanted to harn myself in the morning.\n\nOne of the things I brought up:  Yesterday we went to the beach with his brother and he didn’t swim nor play ball with us. He laid on our towels (he didn’t bring one) and read his book the entire time. He didn’t walk with us bc he wanted to get hug first. I bring this up to him as one of the things that bothered me bc I feel he prioritises other stuff when I wanted to go to the beach with him and I felt like he wasn’t there. As often he told me he was there and that I got mad “because I read a book?”. Like why is he missing the point? This kind of responses and him saying I’m overreacting when I was trying to communicate made me feel so powerless that I started hurting my head. He then said I was performative. I don’t think he likes me sometimes.\n\nHe's working towards his goals. But I feel like the process is going very slowly. And it tells him to learn how to trade. Because he knows someone that also does it and he has financial independence. And I just feel like he's not really going places as I want to. Because of my situation, I have to make a lot of money very quickly so I can escape my situation and I can get my own place. And for me that's a priority. And he's still finishing his university degree. He's making very little money. I feel like our situation is not getting better anytime soon. And I cannot stand it. Because I know that there are some men there that put in the work and are productive and driven and successful. And that work day and night to achieve what they have to. Because of my line of work, I feel like many men would not like to date me (I’m a cam girl). So idk if I’m being unrealistic and if I would ever get a man like me (fit, productive, caring) to marry me. I'm going to start making a lot of money soon. And that's all I need to focus on because of my situation. I feel financially dependent on him because I can only record and stream on his room. I feel like I have no place to go. And I just feel very unhappy all the time.\n\nI don't know what to do with my life. I feel very lost. I feel like I've lost so many years if I break up now. I feel like no high value man is going to want me. And I really don't want to go back to my house. I only have 4k saved up. I feel like getting old and miserable so be every day is harder. I'm going to have to spend it all if I move out. And things might not work out. And I'm so scared. And I want to give up. Because my life has been always so hard. And I'm so tired of fighting. I feel so alone. Like he won't make the change in the progress that I need. And I'm so lost. I need advice on what to do. Options I have thought about: be in this situation til I make enough (idk if I can keep going),  try couples conseuling, leave and go somewhere and spend all my money and try to make it back.

We've known eachother for two years and we've been very much into eachother for a long time, but now I asked her to start dating, she was hesitant but at the end she agreed.

On monday we were planing to go on a date to the museum, but when I checked the prices turned out the place is closed, so I told her we might have to change plans but still I wanna take her out, I send her a message telling her about the change of plans, but still hasn't responded (I know it's because she's on an out with friends, so her not responding soon isn't really the issue. The thing is, and we fought yesterday about this, I'm a very careless person, I am the kind of person who makes decisions and plans without thinking things throu, which leads to conflicts where she's unsure and insecure. I know I could be doing much better, but I'm very fearful, lazy and all in all a very frustrating person to deal with, I want her to feel seen but when I try I always relly on trying to empatize with throu experiences I've lived but that frustrates her more cuz it makes her feel like I'm directing the thing to myself, which is still true cuz I know I can be egocentric. I don't know how to show apreciation in a healthy way, and I know I need to go to the psycologist but I don't have the time or the money for that, I am fearful of hurting her, I don't want her to hate me nor do I want her to feel insecure, sad, fearful or anyting. I know I can't control her emotions, but I want to show her that I care. We're going on our first date and I feel like I already fucked up, this woman is truly someone I love and someone I want to spend all my time with and yet I choose not to spent as much time as I should, I struggle with comunication, taking iniciative, and she and I have discussed this already, but I'm going in circles on this already. I never know what can I do to take her on a regular date and she's done more than enough for this relationship, and she's so frustrated because she's giving her best and I'm not, and she's right. Guys, I'm really on the edge right here, please give me some advice, a wake up call, I know many of you will tell me I'm emotionally inmature or stuff like that, and I know many responses will asume I shouldn't drag her into my mess, and that's the least I want to do, I don't wanna get better just for her, I wanna be better for myself, cuz I want to prove myself I'm good enough, that not only I deserve love but that I can be better at giving love. Any advice will help, and sincerily thank you\n\n  \nTL,DR: My friend and I just started dating and I'm not being a good partner. We're having our first date but I'm about to change plans cuz of my irresponsability. WHat can I do to make her feel seen, loved and cared for?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

She’s studying in a city in Mexico, and I work in Northern California. We’re both from the same hometown in Mexico. I used to visit her every 2–3 weeks for a few days (5 days aprox), but since early July, when she went back home for summer break, we haven’t seen each other. I had already planned to visit our hometown in mid-August for about 10 days, and we were planning to see each other then.\n\nAfter she got back home, we had some issues, mostly my fault.

I asked her a couple of weeks ago if I could visit her during that trip, and she said she’d rather I didn’t. I got the feeling she said that more because she didn’t want me to spend money unnecessarily.\n\nStill, I decided to book a flight anyway, not as a surprise, but because I truly believe even seeing her for a few minutes would be worth it. The flight is short and affordable, and I have friends and family there, so I won’t be a burden or expect her to make time if she can’t.

Prior to this we’d kissed, cuddled and had physical touch. Despite me asking him to have sex and telling him I’m ready, he told me he didn’t want to have sex at that point because he knew that I had an anxious attachment style. He was concerned us having sex and being intimate would make me more attached to him than if we take things slow. After I asked he told me “You’re not ready” and I said “How do you know?” to which his response was “Because I have an idea and know what’s healthy for you”. Fast forward to us having sex for about 4 weeks, twice a week, things were healthy and he was always very sweet and affectionate, texting me throughout the day, and checking up on me. Whenever we hung out he would get me an Uber there, an Uber home, order me food etc. I hung out with him one time because I was feeling sad and he let me come over and just held me, no expectations of sex and talked to me and stay the night with him. Today he texted me saying he wouldn’t be able to hangout tonight after making plans last night and saying he was excited to see me. I didn’t respond and he then called me and asked if I saw his text. I told him I did, but didn’t get the chance to respond. He then went on to say he doesn’t think he can see me anymore. He feels like his mind is too consumed with us having sex and it’s distracting him and effecting his work. He said he thinks about it obsessively. The last time we saw each other he specially told me he didn’t want to have sex that morning because he wanted a clear head space going into the day and to be productive at work, but we did because I asked a few times (I didn’t think he was being serious he was walking around naked and kissing me…that was dumb of me to assume), and he said he couldn’t focus at work and was distracted all day. I know he’s told me before he’s trying to focus on getting a new position in his career, working out, eating healthy and just building healthy habits overall. I’ve sent him explicit pictures and videos to which he’s been open about masturbating to and he said he’s trying to break this habit because he feels like it’s “bad” to be in that mindset. He ended the call by saying “I think the world of you and I still want to be here for you so if you need anything you can text me, and as much as I’d like to be friends I don’t think I can do that right now because I can’t control myself around you?” He said he was going to talk to his therapist about it and these feelings.

{"id": "u/Icy-muoberry6162_1368", "user": "u/Icy-muoberry6162", "text": "I (29F) do not want kids, my boyfriend (29M) wants one\n\nFirst thing : my apologies for the possible mistakes in grammar and such, I'm French.\n\nWe've been together for 2 years now. We live separately but a few weeks ago my boyfriend asked me if I would agree to move with him once our professional situations would be stable enough. He's been in a medical limbo for almost three years now, which means he's never really taken the time to think about whether or not he wanted children. In fact, when we first met, he was completely resistant to the subject (which was fine with me, since on the very first date I told him I didn't want children and was considering having my tubes tied).\n\nHe has an older brother who has been a father for a year and a half, and a younger brother who just announced that he and his partner were expecting a child in may. From the moment they announced it, I knew they were going to come after me with \"what about the both of you?\", etc. \"They\" being my boyfriend's family because I do not have one anymore, I'm on my own. My boyfriend already feels quite isolated from the rest of his siblings because of his health problems, I knew it was only a matter of time before he felt isolated because he doesn't have any kid of his own. All the alarms went off in my head, when we discussed it he told me that I was making up scenarios in my head for nothing, that I was worrying too much... I reiterated that there was no way I was having a child, that it was something he would never have from me.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that he had changed his mind several months ago without telling me. He admitted to me two days later that he had known for 5 months that he wanted a child, that he wanted to leave \"a legacy\". We said goodbye on good terms, we still communicate by messages but I can't help but try to resolve this situation which, I know, is insoluble.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I'm mostly sad and bitter. These two years together were tumultuous to say the least, especially because of his health problems. We \"broke up\" once or twice, but I always hung on because a person's health is not a reason to break up for me. I made a lot of concessions and compromises to make it work; in retrospect, I was the one who kept our relationship going. Communication isn't his strong point, and he's what I call \"emotionally constipated.\" It was very difficult to get him to talk about his feelings, to open up to me. At the very beginning of our relationship, he even accused me of trying to \"change\" him just because I wanted him to talk to me. I'm aware of the efforts he made for me, but I remain bitter. Because a hypothetical child who may never exist automatically puts me out of the game when I gave absolutely everything I had for him, as if it didn't matter.\n\nI couldn't list all the reasons why I don't want children because there are so many, but despite that, I was ready to make one last concession: to promise to think about it again the day I have a stable professional, financial and material situation without any guarantee that the definitive answer would be positive. It's really the most I can do because there is no we're having a \"band-aid child\" who will not be wanted by one of his parents. I know it's a bad idea because he will wait on me all these years and I will never be serene because of that, but I can't help but try to find a solution, to not let the boat sink like that.\n\nThe worst part, and I may be cruel for thinking this and writing it here, is that I don't even think he'd make a good father. We both had violent childhoods, and right now I can't see him ending up any other way than like his father or mine. Wanting a child is easy, being ready to be a father is something else. He hates when something is unexpected and plans need to change and untimely noise, he describes his brothers as \"incarcerated\" in their relationships, and suddenly he wants to join them? I'd like to make him understand that there are other ways to \"leave a legacy,\" that we could both be absolutely happy, that we could babysit our nephews/nieces from time to time without having to change our lives irreversibly. On the other hand, he has every right to change his mind, and it would probably be rude of me to try to convince him to make this final concession for me, for all the ones I've made for him. If the roles were reversed, I don't know if I would accept it.\n\nShould I still try to talk him out of it ?\n\nTL;DR: I don't want children, he wants one, I'm trying not to lose my mind.\n\n  \nEDIT : Thanks everybody for your kind replies.\n\nI just want to clarify a point/add something that can explain why I'm so conflicted about this while the answer is kinda obvious.\n\nAs I said in the original post, I do not have a family of my own anymore. It's been 10 years (I'm gonna spare you the details but my grandfather couldn't keep his hands to himself and nobody did anything to stop him), so it sort of healed something in my when my boyfriend introduced me to his parents for the first time. 2 years ago was the first Christmas I didn't spend alone, crying in my apartment because I felt like a failure. Now I'm scared of the next one.\n\nI know having a kid to \"heal\" a part of yourself is one of the most selfish reasons to have children (and frankly I do not see any selfless reason to have a kid anyway) but sometimes I wonder if it could heal me in some way. I know that despite the fact that I want to be childfree I would be a great mom, but I know that it would also k\\*ll me. I long for a family. I finally had one again, now it's gone. I kinda feel betrayed (I shouldn't, I know it's because the wound is still fresh that I feel this way).\n\nMoreover, it made me consider the fact that my material situation is a big part of why I'm so adamant about not having kids : I'm unemployed because even selling your soul in this goddamn country cannot give you a job, I'm still living in the same studio I found when I was in college (so 1 living room with a kitchen in the corner, no separate bedroom). Will I change my mind once I live in a \\*real\\* apartment where I don't sleep where I cook ?\n\nIt made me doubt. I started searching \"gothic baby\" on Instagram to see if it would awaken something in me (being a goth myself I can only birth evil), I started dreaming about the both of us with a little girl wearing Dr Martens that I would initiate to my favourite bands and mosh with in the living room.\n\nNeedless to say, my head is a mess right now.

We started dating at the end of high school and have been long distance during college, visiting each other every 4–6 weeks.\n\nFor some context, months before we were together, she was sexually assaulted at a sleepover. She and some of the other people there got really drunk and she was pressured by one of her friends (a girl a year older than her) into things she didn’t want to do. On top of that, she was raised in a super religious household that pushed purity culture hard, so she grew up feeling a lot of shame around the topic or idea of sex.\n\nIn our relationship (first relationship for both of us), we didn’t go past kissing for the first month or two. Eventually, we started doing more sexually and had sex for the first time around month four (after one failed and rly embarrassing attempt lol). We were both virgins (her assault didn’t escalate to intercourse, and was with a girl anyways). Our sex life was always pretty minimal since her libido was a lot lower than mine.\n\nAfter being long distance for a few months, she realized something: while she missed me a lot emotionally and physical, she didn’t miss sex necessarily. She still got a little horny sometimes, and we sometimes even phone sexted (embarrassing, I know haha, but desperate times call for desperate needs), but she didn’t really deeply crave or feel desire for sex it in the way that I did.\n\nDuring a visit during this spring semester, she told me she wanted to take intercourse off the table. She was still okay with other things (like touching and oral), but said she didn’t feel fully comfortable during sex. She later explained that she realized she was disassociating during sex, like mentally checking out, and that really made her uncomfortable. I honestly had no idea she was experiencing that, I just thought I was doing something wrong, or that she wasn’t attracted to me, or that I was bad at sex. I thought something was wrong with me and it made me very insecure with myself physically and sexually.\n\nShe also told me she wants to feel close during sex, and not lusted over. That made sense, and I never wanted her to feel objectified, but hearing that was hard because I thought I’d already been showing love and care for so many months, especially in those moments. We talked about what I can do to be close to her during sex, and I feel I implemented those things well. I wasn’t trying to use her, I just wanted that deeper closeness too. Sex to me is about love, bonding, connection. To me, it’s not just physical release, it’s an emotional and spiritual experience that brings extreme closeness (we are both fairly religious but view sex differently).\n\nI told her of course I respect her decision. I would never want to do anything she’s not comfortable with. But I also felt disappointed. And over time, even the “other” sexual stuff stopped, and physical intimacy became rare altogether. I eventually had a soft but honest conversation with her and said that I don’t think I can stay in a long-term relationship where sex is completely off the table. Not because I don’t love her, I really do love this girl so much, but because sex matters to me too.\n\nThis summer (she’s home from school), things have gotten even worse. But the reason being is because she told me she’s putting herself first now and is no longer doing anything just to make me happy, which I’m actually glad about, because she should never feel pressured. But it also makes me feel a little sick knowing that she might’ve done sexual things in the past just to please me, even when she didn’t want to. I had no idea at the time, and I’d never have been okay with it if I did.\n\nShe recently started therapy, but it hasn’t helped much yet. I know healing isn’t instant, but I’m starting to feel stuck. I even asked her once if she was seeing someone else, not because I truly thought she was cheating, but because I’ve seen a shit ton of similar posts online where that was the case. She said no, and I honestly do believe her, that’s not in her character at all and nothing would lead me to believe that.\n\nShe’s bisexual, and I’ve wondered if maybe she’s just not that into guys sexually, or just me\nsexually. I asked if that was the reason, and she promised it wasn’t. I also asked if she might be asexual, and she said no, though I could tell the question upset/offended her. I felt bad for bringing it up, but I’m just trying to make sense of all this.\n\nAlso, she got on birth control around the time we started long distance, and switched to a new one a couple months ago (I honestly forgot the reason why). I know her libido has always been low but I think this might be adding to it even more.\n\nShe says she feels broken and that she feels like less of a woman because of all of this. I know she feels really bad about herself and she’s scared I’ll eventually leave because of this. And the truth is… I might. I don’t want to. I love her more than anyone. She’s my best friend, I love her so much. I don’t want to imagine my life without her. But if sex just never becomes part of our relationship again, I don’t know how long I can keep going.\n\nI hate that this even has to be a conflict. I know she’s hurting. I’m not mad at her, because it’s not her fault… but I am really irritated and frustrated at the situation. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I haven't found much help online regarding my situation so I just want some insight from people who have been in LDR's. \n\nWe've never met in-person yet, but we are both in our late 20s (same age) and have several common interests, but I'm just starting to get strange gut feelings due to things we've talked about or things that have been said to me. First, we live on the other side of the world - I'm in Ontario, Canada, he's in Victoria, Australia.\n\nExtremely early on in our communications he has  mentioned me coming to visit him, constantly. Never are there any things said about him coming over my way to meet. I've travelled quite a bit in my life so far, and he has informed me he has never left Australia and doesn't even have a passport and is terrified of flying... Another thing that makes me a little weary is that he's never had a girlfriend before, and has never even had sex yet (not a huge deal, but the never had a gf part makes me slightly nervous). I've been in some toxic relationships in the past and have dealt with some traumatizing experiences, so personally, if we eventually do meet in person, I would like it to either be here in Ontario, or another location I've been to/have family in (Germany or Ireland, as I also have family members there).\n\nI've also made it clear from the start that I could never live abroad, for a couple reasons: 1. I'm extremely close with my family and could never live a plane-flight away from them, 2. I'm currently finishing up my undergrad and will hopefully be starting Teacher's College in September 2026 - if I become a teacher here, I will work 10 months of the year and would not be able to do a \"live here for half the year and live there the other half\". What got me is that literally 3 weeks into talking with him, he brought up \"I'll live in Australia for 6 months of the year, and Canada the other 6\". I just can't see that working out long-term and also, that seems waaaaay too early to be 'planning' that, also mentioning kids/having our own place, and 'getting rich for \"me\" so that I never have to work in the future\", that does not entice me one bit, just seems way too fast to be saying these things, and also a bit 'day-dreamy'.   \n\nHe also is in constant communication with me, or so he tries to be. It's becoming very exhausting for me as we have full-blown conversations on three separate apps: Instagram, Telegram, and Snapchat, the Snapchat convos between us are long-winded, video format - sends me at least an hour's worth of snaps in one go. I'm becoming very overwhelmed as I'm also currently enrolled in summer courses and they've been very content heavy, I have communicated that I can't respond quickly to everything all the time and there may be lapses in my responses for a day or two, yet he will still send me a constant flow of messages throughout the day (despite the 14hr time difference). I know I don't have to respond to them right away, but I've even asked if we could cut communication down to just one app and that was completely ignored...\n\nHe's also in a better spot financially compared to me, works from home and is basically his own boss. I'm currently living off student grants/loans and have many bills/obligations to pay for, so travelling for me, is off the table for probably the next few years or so until I get a job in my field, or I somehow fall into money - but that's not realistic, lol. \n\nSorry for this being quite long-winded but I just would like some guidance as to how to deal with LDR's and if my current situation is just way too intense and I should just not continue on with this, I do like him, but I'm feeling very smothered and that my wishes aren't being listened to.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Advice needed.\n\nHey Reddit, I need some outside perspective on my long-distance relationship because I'm starting to feel crazy.\n\nMy (34M) girlfriend (29F) lives in Spain and I live abroad. We've been together for a while (more than 3 years together) and I’m mostly doing all the travelling as I’m more flexible and earn more than she does. For the last year, the plan was decided for me to move to her but sometimes I have my doubts due to quality of work, lack of support network, etc. She is willing to move in the future, but she cannot do that now due to her work.\n\nLately, she's been frustrated that my job search in Spain hasn't been moving as quickly as she'd like. I'll be honest, it's been hard to find the motivation. It's a huge move, leaving my job/family/friends behind is daunting, and the job market is tough. I'm committed, but I'm struggling with the pace.\n\nHere's the current issue: Her friend is having a birthday party in Spain soon, and I really wanted to go. It's a chance to see her and her friends and feel connected to my future life there. I told her I was planning to book a flight and attend the party.\n\nShe got angry and told me that she doesn’t want me to come to the party. Her reasoning is that if I use my money and time to fly over for a \"fun trip,\" it takes away the urgency for me to find a job and move. She says it's a \"waste\" and that I should only come when I have a job secured. She also outright refuses to visit me here for the same reason—to \"force\" me to be the one to make the move.\n\nI feel like this is incredibly manipulative. She's using a fun event I was excited about as a punishment to pressure me into acting faster. It feels less like she's my partner and more like she's my manager withholding a reward.\n\nOn one hand, I get her frustration. She wants us to live in the same country and feels I'm not moving fast enough. On the other hand, I feel like her method is controlling and is making me more resistant and anxious about the entire move, not less.\n\nSo, Reddit, is her tactic a normal level of frustration in a long-distance relationship, or is it a major red flag?\n\nTL; DR: My GF in Spain is forbidding me from visiting her for a friend's birthday party. She says it's to \"force\" me to focus on finding a job there so I can move, instead of taking fun trips. She also refuses to visit me for the same reason.

I’m very insecure about him rejecting me all of sudden. I’m also unsure how to start touching on each other, and kissing. what if he’s actually not into me after tonight? our texting is getting a bit less, but that’s also because we don’t hang out every day.

{"id": "u/CandyTemporary7074_645", "user": "u/CandyTemporary7074", "text": "Two years after breakup. These lessons changed me completely.\n\nIt has been almost two years since the day my relationship ended. I still remember sitting on the floor of my apartment that night with my phone in my hand waiting for a message that never came. I replayed every detail in my head like I was trying to rewrite the ending. Every corner of the city felt haunted. Even the songs I used to love felt poisoned.\n\nAround that time I watched my favorite Rohmer movie *Conte d’hiver*. The way the main character held onto love with almost spiritual devotion hit me hard. That was me. My love had become an obsession, almost like a religion. Regret turned into a daily ritual. I analyzed every moment like scripture, asking myself what I had done wrong. It consumed me. But over time that obsession started to shape me. It didn’t just hurt, it forced me to rebuild my life piece by piece and become a better version of myself.\n\nI learned that heartbreak is real pain, not just in your mind. Neuroscience shows rejection activates the same brain areas as physical injury. That’s why my chest felt like it was tearing open every morning. Guy Winch’s TED Talk on emotional first aid reminded me to treat a broken heart like a broken bone. I stopped pretending I was fine. I cried when I needed to, journaled when the noise got loud, and reached out to friends instead of isolating. That honesty became the first step in healing.\n\nSelf-compassion became my anchor. Kristin Neff’s work showed that people who treat themselves kindly recover faster. At first it felt fake to tell myself “you are doing your best.” But slowly it worked. The shame eased. Writing also became medicine. I wrote short entries about values I wanted to carry forward and red flags I ignored. That turned regret into a plan instead of a prison.\n\nSleep nearly broke me. My nights were restless until I tried Andrew Huberman’s simple tools, morning sunlight, physiological sighs, and non-sleep deep rest. Movement and light helped reset my body. Learning about oxytocin and dopamine explained why I felt like I was going through withdrawal. It wasn’t weakness. It was biology. That realization made it easier to replace the old bond with new routines like working out, volunteering, and building friendships.\n\nBooks & podcasts became my teachers. Attached by Amir Levine is a bestseller that made me rethink how I show up in relationships. This book will make you question everything you think you know about love. The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk is the best healing book I’ve ever read. It shows how the body stores grief and gives tools to release it. Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin podcast made me feel less alone listening to couples work through real struggles. Huberman Lab gave me science I could actually apply to my sleep and mood. The School of Life YouTube channel offered short bursts of philosophy that kept me grounded when I was tempted to spiral. And a friend pushed me toward daily expressive journaling. That practice helped me turn obsession into lessons I could use. Also my friend recommended me BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia University team. It takes books, expert talks, and research and turns them into personalized podcasts. You choose the length and even the host’s voice. I picked a smoky Samantha-from-Her style voice that made the episodes feel intimate. One session blended Esther Perel’s interviews, Gottman Institute research, and neuroscience on bonding. It explained why I was still reaching for my phone at midnight and gave me concrete steps to break the cycle. Reading helped me more than therapy ever did. Honestly. \n\nAttachment theory also gave me clarity. Esther Perel’s talks made me see how my anxious tendencies shaped the relationship. I began practicing “secure” behaviors like setting boundaries and being direct. For the first time I realized regret could be fuel instead of a chain.\n\nAlmost two years later the pain is no longer sharp. What started as obsession has shaped me into someone stronger, clearer, and more secure. I don’t carry the loss like a religion anymore. I’m ready to say goodbye. And I want to thank my ex, for being the reason I learned how to rebuild my life.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Since then, we’ve been talking every day:- calls, long texts, games, movies, music, you name it. It’s been amazing so far, even though we’ve never met in person.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, I proposed to her, it was impulsive and a bit frantic, not how I’d imagined doing it, and honestly at that time I wasn’t even sure what I wanted. But as time passed, I’ve grown to truly love her or at least, what I believe love is.\n\nThe thing is, love and relationships are pretty confusing for me. She’s not my first girlfriend, but I feel like I’m new to real love. I have a few personal issues that make feelings and relationships feel complicated, sometimes I wonder if I even understand what love really means yet.\n\nShe’s highly emotionally intelligent, brutally honest, has strong morals, but at the same time she’s sweet, shy, and innocent in her own way. She has social anxiety but she’s so deep, she questions life with thoughts that makes me see the world differently. She still has that youthful spark: astrology, tarot, K-pop, romantic movies, daydreaming, dancing, singing, all that teenage girl energy that makes her glow.\n\nWe feel very attached to each other, sometimes maybe too attached, yet we still don’t feel close enough. We’re craving the real thing: the physical presence, the daily life together, the warmth you can’t get through a screen, but not just that, we’re craving connection, the one that makes you feel like the other person understands you, you are safe with them and you can be yourself around them.\n\nNow she wants to meet me and I want it too. But right now, I’m starting college (most likely) and I don’t have the money or time to visit her country yet. Realistically, it might take another year or more. And that makes me feel unsatisfied for her. I want her to be happy and to feel like she’s not wasting her youth waiting around for something uncertain.\n\nIf any of you have been in a long-distance relationship like this or met someone online and managed to make it real, I’d love to hear your advice. How do we keep this strong until we can finally meet? How do we handle the distance, the waiting, and the doubts that come up sometimes?\n\nThank you for reading our story,I’d really appreciate any advice or stories you’re willing to share.

We’ve said I love you to each other and he gained my trust enough for us to be sleeping together. I thought that he truly loved me for who I was but with what happened last night, I’m not sure.\nLast night, after sex, we were bored and decided to have some deep conversations. We made a list of questions on ChatGPT and had it choose randomly. \n\nThe first random question was “What is the funniest thing that’s happened to you during sex?” And he answered first. I learned more abt his past sex life so I felt comfortable enough to share mine but he didn’t see it the way I thought and asked if I was hiding anything from him. Though I said no, he suspected one thing I could be lying abt was my body count. That, I have not lied abt. It was always 3 people before him. \n\nBut I then told him that if it’s outside of sex itself(so like on call and sending pics and stuff) there were abt 3 in high school. He started to get judgy so I told him that I’m not proud of it either and I basically ruined my life with it bc the last guy that I did stuff with, he took a screenshot of my nudes and kept it saved, that went on to being shown around his friends (the entire American football team) and rumors about me started spreading and I became known as the high school s-word for it. \n\nHe started making comments on my “hyper sexuality” bc most of the times we do it together, I’m the one asking him for it so I also explained to him that after talking with my therapist that I realized my actions and my mindset wasn’t because of a high sex drive but bc of a collective of past traumas that had shaped how I view life and myself in a very obscure way. \n\nAfter I told him that that was my most shameful secret he just got up, put his clothes on and left the room without me. I followed him out and I asked why he’s just leaving me after I told him that and he asked me why i didn’t tell him before he asked me to be his gf. I tried to make my point that I couldn’t tell him that yet we were barely getting to know each other and I even asked him if he would’ve still asked me to be his gf if he knew this and he said no. I asked him if he thinks I’m a s-word for that and he said yes. He also started saying that he was dating to marry and if I really cared abt him then I would’ve told him before we became official bc if we get married and if someone who has those photos leaks them somewhere, it’s not only me who’s going to be affected but other people as well. But I told him that I didn’t tell him before we became official bc I didn’t know whether I could trust him with that side of me yet. Yet he keeps saying that I shouldn’t have kept something like that from him and he wouldn’t even hold my hand or treat me like he loved me. He doesn’t say I love you back he just left and said bye and that’s it. \n\nWas I wrong for not telling him it before he asked me to be his gf? Where am I in the wrong on this?

Very sad to be posting this but I F29 am considering separating from my husband M33 of 5 years over a big issue we just had a couple of days ago. My husband has always cared about his things, and he puts all his valuables in his office where he works remotely 3 days a week. He put a lock on the outside of the office door 6 months ago to supposedly keep his things safe from our destructive toddler. I let it go, but found it a bit odd since the key is usually no where to be found.\n\nAnyways, I recently went in the office to get our bird's perch out the room, and he was hovering acting really suspicious. He defensively said what do you need in there? And I said the bird's perch...but then instantly felt he was hiding something from me. I also noticed he locked the door after that. After we put our toddler to sleep, I told him I needed to go in the room to change the sheets on our guest mattress because we have visitors soon. He was acting defensive again and said he would do it another time. That is when I said what are you hiding in there? You are getting really defensive, and its weird that I am locked out of a space in my own home and have to ask permission to enter. He got more defensive until I eventually said you need to unlock the door and let me see what is in there because you are hiding something.\n\nLong story short, he admitted to hiding weed in the room and playing video games when I go to sleep. But he REFUSED to open the door. I told him i'm going to sit by the door until he unlocks it because I think he is hiding something worse since those things aren't that big of a deal. You guys, he literally refused. I tried begging, I tried getting the lock open, I tried everything I could think of. Not only would he not unlock the door, but he was gaslighting me the entire time telling me i'm crazy and it must be my pregnancy hormones thinking there was something else in there? He said that if he opens the door, he would be giving in to my pushiness. He also kept touching my leg and telling me he was sorry i'm going through this like I was making all of this up in my head.\n\nUnfortunately, I got too tired around 2am (keep in mine i'm pregnant having to deal with this) and told him i'm going to sleep and whatever he is hiding in there he can get rid of in the morning, but i'm done. In the morning, the room was perfectly staged with his little weed pen out and switch game. He has changed the lock on the door to a normal one that only locks when someone is in the room, but still seems to see no problem with what he has done. He is still adamant that it is perfectly normal to lock a door from the outside if you have important things in there. He also said there was nothing else in there and he just couldn't for the life of him let me in after I said we needed to go through his stuff. He said that was controlling behavior and giving in would be saying that was okay.\n\nI guess what i'm asking is...is it normal to put a lock on an office door even on the outside? Would a separation by the best next steps?

My earliest memory of her was her accusing me of being the reason she and my father's marriage dissolved.\n\n\n\n\nShe had me young, at 19 and she made a point of reminding me that she was prevented from having a normal 20's because she had to raise me. I was frequently left with relatives, until she had a falling out with them over something and then I would be yanked out of their lives.\n\n\n\nShe was spiteful, childish and I was always in her view, in competition with her for whatever man she was currently dating. She refused to accept/acknowledge that I had my own personality and openly told me I should not have my own goals because I was an extension of her.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe'd monitor my every move, read my diary and I was not allowed to have friends.My trust was completely broken by her when I was on the way to university and she for reasons unknown, amused herself by creating a fake Facebook profile of one of the boys in my class and trying to engage me in an online relationship.

What happened was that he was getting into a physical fight with someone who happens to my brother's friend. Him and my boyfriend had some issue and when my brother called me he was really angry about what my boyfriend was doing. I knew that my boyfriend wouldn't have done it without any reason but I still called him and said something like why did you do this what will you do now you shouldn't have done this. I was talking normally but suddenly he yelled at me saying what are you even talking about I don't need your permission to go fight with someone who I have a problem with and in the end he cut the call on my face. I was really stunned and obviously felt hurt too. Later he called and apologised and said that the reason he acted this way over it is because he felt like I was displaying him as weak and thinking that I feel like he would lose and stuff like that. And also mentioned that in his childhood some things have happened where he always felt weak and was always termed that way that's why what I said triggered some memory.I didn't say anything on it but 8 still felt really bad about it. A few days later I was telling him about something sensitive like my father had yelled at me about something so I crying about it to him and he was comforting me but then I said you also yelled at me why am 8 telling you this. I was still crying and in the heat of the moment here. But then he started to say \"what you were doing you deserved it\" and \"I would do it again you made me feel that bad that's why 8 did it\" and I felt really hurt About it so I said you're just like my father and that I don't feel like telling you anything you're so terrible etc etc . Then we had a heated argument. Note that my point was that if I didn't intentionally trigger any memory then why is he harsh with me and his point was that intentionally or unintentionally you did trigger it and the memory is so bad that it's deserving. At the end of the argument he told me what the probelm was , he said he was $a'€d when he was a child. He also was always called weak and wimp by everyone since he was a kid and that's why it happened.  He had never told me this especially the first part. I was really stunned and felt bad for him. But now he doesn't feel like talking to me he doesn't feel like facing me cause I know it and he never wanted me to know but apparently I had pushed him to that limit. He's barely talking and no matter how much 8 try he can't seem to forget about it. any advice ?\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend has opened up about a past memory and he feels bad talking to me or facing me now.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I (26F) met Jay (28M) through a common friend after I visited their country due to a business trip on February. On May-June I went back to his country, we went on 6 dates which were very special to both of us -or so I thought. He asked me to visit his country again, that I could stay over at his appartment for as long as I wanted to -he said I could stay for a few months, even. We were going steady since June, having weekly calls, sexting, sending pictures, chatting everyday. 4 weeks ago I called him to discuss our expectations with my trip visiting him and we agreed we were on the same page: we would be intimate emotionally and physically, we would go on dates, and overall just enjoy the moment, not necessarily getting serious.\n\nYesterday, I arrived and saw a few red flags: he's not picking me at the airport and he didn't even get to the car when I got there to his building. Then, at his appartement, he's not kissing me, hugging me, anything. Physical thouch is at zero. We spent the day together like this, me feeling awkward because why is he pushing away? \n\nI took the bravery to ask him about his behavior. He said he's seeing another girl since 3 weeks ago. He apologized for not telling me sooner, but his expectations changed radically after going on some dates with her. He just wants to remain friends, and for me that would have beeen okay if he told me previously and not 3 hours after landing in his country. He said he really would like to have intimacy with me, but his consciousness doesn't let him because of his feelings for this chick. I just feel terribly sad and broken right now. Even though my intentions were not romantic, I feel humiliated and stupid. He has insisted that I can stay with him but i don't feel comfortable anymore. \n\nAfter that conversation, we made the mistake of getting some drinks and getting tipsy. We said a lot of passive-aggressive/flirty comments, and that was just putting salt on the wound. Today he went to a hike with this girl (he even invited me to join them) and hasn't said anything. Idk if it's important (at least it kinda is for me), he said they haven't even kissed. I told him I don't feel comfortable staying in a bed were he's gonna fuck her after the hike while I do my plans. He reassured me that it wasn't a possibility because they haven't even kissed. He said he wants to ask her about them and if she's not into him, he'll go right up with me because I'm the \"best hookup\" he's ever had.

I don’t have close friends to talk to about this, and I’m honestly at a breaking point. I (21/M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (22/F) for almost nine months. She’s my first serious relationship and I love her deeply, but when it comes to intimacy, I feel constantly confused, undesired, and hurt.\n\nShe has depression and started medication two or three months before we met. Early in the relationship, she was flirty, gave signs that she liked me, and spoke about intimacy in ways that made me feel wanted. A few months in, she told me she had made out with another guy at her gym. At that time, we had met in person a couple of times, but she hadn’t done that with me yet. Hearing it crushed me. I felt jealous, inadequate, and like I wasn’t enough. We fought, cried a lot, and eventually I forgave her because I saw her efforts before that incident. But it left a lasting scar.\n\nSince then, our physical intimacy has been limited. We cuddle, kiss, and hug, and she sometimes initiates affection. On calls, she tells me she misses me and wants to cuddle. So she’s not cold or distant. But when it comes to deeper sexual intimacy, it feels like I’m always the one initiating or asking for things she did naturally with others in her past. There have been a few times when I confronted her directly, crying and expressing my insecurities, asking why she refuses to be more intimate, and after those emotional conversations, we did have moments of intimacy. These moments happened a handful of times, but only after I pushed or after emotional breakdowns. Most of the time, if I try to engage without that buildup, she refuses or responds minimally.\n\nShe has said that the medication affects her libido and mood. She has suggested trying things like sexting or masturbating together, and we’ve had conversations about exploring each other’s needs. But almost every time, these ideas don’t turn into real follow-through. I will initiate flirtation or intimacy, and the most I usually get is a giggle, a small “thank you” or “mmm,” and then the moment dies or she falls asleep. This leaves me feeling rejected, inadequate, and like I’m constantly asking for something that should come naturally.\n\nRecently, I accidentally saw her browser history and realized she watches porn. That discovery hurt even more. It made me feel like she has sexual energy, but she doesn’t share it with me. I haven’t told her I know, but it’s added to my insecurities.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling unwanted, unattractive, and constantly comparing myself to her past. She has told me stories about making out with guys who turned out to be assholes, and I can’t help but feel jealous that she was more physically forward with them than with me, the person who loves her and treats her well. At the same time, she does show affection in other ways, so I’m stuck between feeling loved and feeling undesired.\n\nI don’t want to shame her for having depression or being on medication, and I don’t want to pressure her. But I also don’t want to spend the relationship feeling like a second choice or constantly inadequate. I’m struggling to reconcile my love for her with the hurt and insecurity I feel. I keep overthinking and feeling undesired even though she reassures me that we’ll try things and figure stuff out.\n\nI used ChatGPT to help frame my thoughts, so please don’t mind my phrasing English isn’t my first language. I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has perspective on how to handle intimacy challenges in an LDR where one partner has low libido due to medication, depression, or past experiences.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nI (21/M) am in a 9-month LDR with my girlfriend (22/F) who has depression and started meds before we met. Early on she was flirty, but now she rarely initiates sexual intimacy and I feel undesired. She made out with another guy early in the relationship, which left me insecure, and recently I found out she watches porn, making me feel worse. I’m always the one initiating intimacy, and the few moments of deeper intimacy usually only happen after emotional breakdowns or serious confrontation. She suggests trying things like sexting or masturbating together but rarely follows through. I love her but feel inadequate and unwanted.

I just need to let this out because I’ve been crying for days and the pain is too much already. \n\nAs the title says, my LDR boyfriend ghosted me. \n\nWe haven’t been together for a long time but my feelings for him were real and deep. \n\nWe spent 10 straight days together before he left to work to another country. \n\nWhen we were together in person, everything was perfect. He was so sweet, kind, loving and everything I wanted in a guy. He was literally my dream guy. Everything just felt right when I was with him. \n\nWe even have the same birthdays and we have a lot of coincidences. \n\nSo I thought he was the guy for me already. \n\nWhen he left for another country, our communication was so bad. It takes him hours to reply because he said he was busy. \nWe barely even called each other too.\n\nI’ve communicated with him that I don’t like it when he disappears for hours without me having 0 knowledge about what he’s doing. I told him to just tell me if he was gonna be busy and I would 100% understand it. \n\nThen just last week, he disappeared again for hours. I talked to him about it and he said sorry and asked for another chance. He promised he wouldn’t do that again and it would be the last time I would bring it up. That’s another thing I liked about him is that he was easy to talk to and we were immediately able to fix the problem. \n\nThen just a day before our 1st monthsary, he was taking hours to reply again. I was a bit upset too the day before since he didn’t tell me that he was going to someone’s house after disappearing again. He just told me when he was there already. \n\nI asked if he can make some time to call me. He said “I’ll try. I have to wake up early tom” because it was his first day at work. I asked what time he needed to sleep and if cant call earlier. \n\nAnd that was the last time I heard from him. \n\nI followed up the same night to ask if he still has time to call and he didn’t respond. I sent him a long message at 12 am on our monthsary to greet him and wish him luck on his first day. No response at all.\n\nI also sent him a gift and I think he was able to receive it but still no response. \n\nI tried to call and text him to tell him if he wanted some space he could just tell me\n\nNo response at all and he didn’t even bother opening my messages. \n\nI’m really just so hurt right now. I’ve been crying for days and it’s killing me inside how I don’t have any closure. \n\nI was preparing also to get a visa so I can visit him the next few months.

Messages about how she’s going to be single, wants to be single, feels like she should be single, and going to have her last hoorah as “single” on an upcoming trip.\n\nThese were found using the search function on the messages.\n\nAdditionally, I found messaging between her and a man I’ve never heard of that were somewhat flirty in nature including sending photos back and forth.\n\nLastly, found messages between her and her “handy man” including “good morning beautiful”, heart emojis, and her thanking him for the money.\n\n(shes identified as a lesbian for 10+ years...?..)\n\nI tell her what I saw and she apologizes immensely— said it was venting and she didn’t mean any of it, ((we were having some communication problems before and said that’s why she said the single comments)), the messages were sent to 7-9 different people including family and friends. \n\nShe said the flirty messages was attention seeking and brushed off the handyman messages saying “he’s just like that, he’s like my dad. He’s a 50 something year old”.\n\nI ask if there’s anything else on her phone I would want to know about\n\n If there’s anything else that would hurt me\n\nShe swears that’s it and I agree to try to work through and agree to do couples therapy.\n\n  \n\n\nFast forward to today, I search her phone again to find almost everything deleted (no surprise) — but search the “handy man” name and I find messages about him giving her $600, $900, going to the beach with him, being tired of him, being annoyed by him, thinking he blocked her. Etc. so my assumption is— he’s a sugar daddy (of sorts)\n\nI bring it up that I think there’s more info she’s not telling me about him. She continues to tell me no. They are “just friends”, they’ve loaned each other money back and forth and never gifted any money. Swears he’s just the handy man about 4 times.\n\nFinally, I ask to see her phone and search his name right in front of her - She initially gets angry with me and pulls the phone away saying we’re done looking at it. After some arguing, she comes clean.\n\nSays he is kinda her sugar daddy and that she lied because she felt so ashamed and embarrassed about it.\n\nI begin sobbing and she does too. She later apologied, saying it broke her heart to hurt me like that. Says she will do whatever it takes to build this and wants to be with me. She loves me so much and wants to be with me, etc. \n\nI’m not sure if I can trust and forgive from this.\n\nThank you for your advice and thoughts on this situation -- and if youve read this far. \n\n  \nTLDR: lesbian mistrust — how to move forward after a year of secrets and lying?\n\n\n\nMy post keeps getting deleted so im trying again with rewording of the specific situation. \n\n  \n**Considering moving forward in the relationship, how can we process this and rebuild the trust?**", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

So basically we used to go the same school then I moved schools then when I was 15 I got his insta handle and we started texting as friends and we liked each other but didn't work out ..fast forward to when we were 18 , we got back together and we were mature and knew how relationships work and it was going well I mean very well . He was such a green flag my friends used to be jealous of me for having such a perfect guy ,I mean he was my dream guy never yelled at me , didn't check out girls, was a good friend to everyone a good son a good brother etc... he used to gift me stuff ,get me flowers , give me attention, was emotionally available, also he has a very good kind heart . He loves me so much . But I did see in Instagram and tiktok about how the honeymoon period doesn't last and I often used to think well I'm so lucky he still treats me like that ,I mean he was so perfect , he would never lose interest or stop doing all the efforts and work that he put into the relationship. Now talking about me I am head over heels in love with this guy ,i love him so much ... I have never loved anyone like this I mean I didn't know u could love a person like this he's my world ... I mean I just can't live without him I mean I can but it would be so hard ... I would never be happy ...he is the love of my life . We are doing long distance but he still takes out time for me calls me texts me ... He never ignores me and I also don't ignore him . Of course we do have arguments but we solve it right then and there . We we fought we always try to make it right again rather than our ego taking over . He was so innocent. Sometimes when we argue he says sorry even I am the one in the wrong and eventually time passed after one year and 3 months I don't know what happened he started acting different like ,he would call me text me and do all that but he kind of started getting busy , I mean I understand that we are doing long distance of course he has a life there but I just missed how he was at the beginning moreover that we are in college and we need to focus rather than calling and texting each other all the time I totally understand that but I just miss how it used to be before ... Some examples will most of the days he forgets to text me goodnight, or not watch the reels I send him , he used to be the first person on my insta share ( he isn't now)and I used to like all these things even though it wasn't that big a deal I liked it . Sometimes I felt like he was ignoring me or whatever and also I noticed something different in the way he behaved ,it was not the old him . Like after a week or so I asked him whether he was okay and then he said he was I asked him again after two days he replied the same . I asked him what changed and he was always like what the hell are you talking , I kind of felt like he was falling out of love with me , idk maybe I am just overthinking cause he loves me that much \nFinally he said that he was going through something and he doesn't know what it is and and he will get himself out of it so he just needs time and I didn't know how I could help him so I was like okay I understand u take ur time . Then I started checking in with him regularly and he said he was getting better this went around for two months and he was acting the same much worse it's like we had lost all the spark and connection we had . One day I texted him saying idk what's happening to u or whatever but it's kinda affecting me bad and I said to him that u are also not telling me what's going on and he kinda got angry at me saying what's ur probelm just give me some time ...i meAn I wAnted to give him time but it was eating me alive ..Nd I kinda got sad he was angry at me and I didn't have time to read and hear rest of the messages cause I was in college by the time I reached home he deleted all of it and said sorry and I told him I never read the rest of it and he was like no u don't need to and he said sorry for the way he was acting and it got sorted out . Then one time I went out with him and idk I still felt that thing ... I didn't feel the connection we used to have ..one thing that really made me sad that day was he used to care for me like a baby and always held my hand while crossing roads this time he just crossed by himself and I asked him from there like why he didn't hold my hand and he said sorry like a 100 times I was like it's ok\nFor anyone reading u may think oh what's the big deal like other girls out there are getting cheated on or something I know i know that I have a good guy it's just that I miss what we had , idk or he just became comfortable with me that he felt like he didn't need to put that much efforts . I did confront him about all the other things he was doing and he always puts the blame on me idk what to do I didn't change after two years I still am very nice to him and treat him good I still talk to him and flirt with him like we used like the time we started dating.... Even after the first fight we still had many fights on this . I try to understand that he is busy , but it's just me waiting for his call or text and another new thing about him that pisses me off is that sometimes he acts like a hypocrite like he won't do that for me but sometimes expects me to do it . Idk what to i can't breakup with him for this I think because noone will consider this as an actual issue but it kinda has been ruining my mental health for 7 months . I'm so committed to him and I can't leave him for this . And he will be so heartbroken if I leave him idk even if i leave him ever I won't date anyone else cause hes my first love ,I will always love him . I can't physically or mentally love another man . Ever .it's either him or noone \n\nQuestion:\nThis has been affecting my mental health, but I don’t want to break up over it.\nHow can I communicate my needs without making him feel attacked?\nWhat steps can I take to figure out if this relationship is still healthy for me long term ?", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/fyndor_1630", "user": "u/fyndor", "text": "I (44M) didn't think it would be this hard to fix the marriage with my wife (41F)\n\nMy wife and I have had a rocky relationship basically since our second kid was born 8 years ago. We do not do well together under stess, and the process of the first year with kid #1 nearly broke us. I always wanted more than one kid, but I was ready to cut it off at one after that first experience. It seemed like a risk to go through that process again after we had just barely survived the first time. But I let her convince me it would be ok, and it very much was not ok. Unfortnately, not only did it fracture our relationship again, but this time it never repaired.\n\nFrom what I can gather, essentially I'm looking at post-pardum depression, converting in to just plain ole' depression, for my wife. My contribution to the mess, from my own biased but self-reflecting opinion, was originally my severe ADHD complicating things. At the start of this, I was undiagnosed and my coping skills having gone 40 years without knowing I had ADHD were not great. They still arent really, but knowing helps. At this point though, unfortunately I am adding my own dose of depression into the mix. And that is the real problem to fixing this at this point I think.\n\nWe snapped during COVID. She cheated, and I threw a hail marry and moved the family across the country to be with her family in hopes of saving our marriage. I think overall it's been good for the kids because family, but I did not think I would be sitting here in 2025 and still living in a loveless marriage. That is really just breaking me and is what eventually lead to my depression. I thought I could just whether the storm, I could eventually get her out of the depression, and we could move forward. It seemed better than the alternative. I had no idea it could possibly go this long, but given the effort that has been made, it really no surprise. She makes zero effort, would even admit as much, because years ago she decide she would just wait for the divorce to fix her own issues. I assume that still to this day, in her mind, I am the sole cause of our issues. And she had me believing it for a while too. After years of self reflection, I know I'm not perfect, I can see my flaws, but I can also see I am not the sole reason for our issues. My biggest core issue really is just ADHD and my garbage skills at dealing with it. Now I have the additional issue that being unloved for so long has left me sad and bitter, so when conflict does arise I am not good at biting my tongue and descalating anymore.\n\nAt this point, unfortunately, I think it is safe to say I am more depressed than she ever was or is. I have been white knuckling life for 5 years straight and it has broken me. And the really sad thing to me is that, I feel like if I didn't have this depression, I think I could repair our relationship at this point. I know what it would take, but she has been so consistently breaking me down for 5 years that I don't know if I have the willpower in me to actually pull it off anymore. It's all the simplest shit too. For instance, our house looks like a depression nest. It doesn't look like horders you see on TV, but some some downscaled version of that kind of filth. My 8 yr old is messy as hell, it really is pretty fair to say he has caused 80% of the mess in our house. He uses the ground as a trash can essentially. I'm sure this fucked up relationship somehow probably shaped that. If I were to guess the single biggest issue with moving forward is how messy our house is. I have come to realize it is one of the significant issues in this fucked up situation, but damn if it doesn't just seem like an impossible mountain at this point. For one it is just me doing all the work, she won't lift a finger. And that 8 year old really will turn right around and trash the place in a weeks time, so when I muster the strength to sit down and clean a room, I will have my wife critize how I didn't clean it nearly enough and how it's not up to her standards. That fucks with me. The house is so fucked its probably a legitimate full 40 hr work week worth of work if you were to finish the job completely. Between my kids destruction, my wife's lack of support, and my own ADHD instincts to not see through large tasks, I just can't get it done. I don't think I have gotten more than 3 rooms done in the past 5 years before losing focus or giving up and then it gets immediately trashed very quickly as if I did nothing and we are back to looking like horder wannabees. Point being though, I KNOW that if nothing else, if I could just have a clean house that stayed clean for say a month or two, I KNOW it would have a significant impact on the mental health in this house. We have 2 ADHD kids and ADHD dad who can never find anything because every room has infinity things laying around so you cant find anything and lose stuff every day. And I know is one of the significant factors in my our marriage at this point. But she won't lift a finger to do anything about it, and im so broken at this point I'm not sure if I am even capable of seeing the job fully through to completion. I have said I would for 5 years and havent succeeded yet. Not once. Not even close. I think best I ever did was 6 out of 10 rooms. It such a simple task. Hell my 8 yr old got a wild hair today because he realized he could make some money and cleaned 70% of the biggest room in the house. It took him probably 4 hours straight, but he did a great job and I could probably finish the job with another 30 min of work. Point being, it is such a solvable problem, but this woman broke me so thoroughly I can't even pull it together to get that done at this point even though I know how much good it would do.\n\nOn some level, I'm proud of myself of taking one for the team and keeping this family alive. But this cost has been way more than I ever understood going in to this. It would be so easy to walk away. But I can't. She has showed her hand in subtle ways enough times, I have unfortunately figured out she doesn't actually hate me. I definitely wouldn't describe her as \"in love with me\", but I know there is still love there. It is just hiding under a pile of depression, manifested physically and mentally. You could argue I should leave for the kids, the house in particular being evidense for it, but for selfish reasons I don't want that. I don't think I could survive not living with my children and I am not confident I would get custody, and I absolutely don't trust her when she swears she would magically all of a sudden start doing all the things I do to make the house/family run. She thinks she can divorce me, and then her life will be fixed instantly and she will start doing things again and be able to do all the things necessary. I can't trust that will be the case. And also I have never managed to actually hate her. I kind of wish I did on some level, because that would allow me to walk away. The reality is, if she would allow it to be the case, our household could look like we just fell in love yesterday if only there was a second willing participant. She has cheated on me, but even worse just throughly broken my spirit, and yet still I would look past all of that in an instant if she could just find a way to open up her heart to me again. This woman hold grudges forever, but for me all it would take would be a single honest heart felt \"I love you\" and I would happily let go years of the hateful, mean, vile shit that has been slung my way. I'm a simple man. I just want to be loved. I have loved this woman through it all. Whether by choice or because my heart just can't let go, I have always loved her. But in 5 years, I have heard I love you from that woman 1 time. One single time. Brought back her favorite icecream on a plane for XMAS using dry ice, and the gesture caught her off guard and I got a genuine legitimite I love you off the deal. But fuck, if I have to go another 5 years to get the next \"I love you\"..... I'm just not built for that. I would rather amputate a limb than go that long again without hearing those words. I need it. It's like air to me and I am suffocating.\n\nTLDR: Living in a loveless marriage for 5 years because I thought I could ride out my wife's depression.  It turns out untreated depression mixed with a rocky marriage don't just magically fix themselves with time.   LIving with someone that is depressed and \"hates you\" appears to be an easy road to becoming depressed yourself.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

She's also going to visit family in colombia there. After her gap year, she's going to come back to my country (or a neighboring country close to me) to study.\n\nWe've agreed to long distance, as were kind of used to it (lived 3 hours away, met 1-2x a month for a period of 8 months before). We're 3 weeks in now. \n\nWe've promised and are planning to meet up during this year - i plan to come to brazil at least once, but as i'm starting uni, it can't be a long duration of time there. \n\nShe's 19 and i'm her first partner for everything. I'm 21 and had a couple partners prior, so i now know what i like and don't like - and i really like her. I see a fantastic future with her in it. I really do love her, but i can't help but also be afraid that my time with her has always been limited. Because for her, her situation is different - she's in her prime, beautiful as hell, and hasn't explored other sexual partners yet. \n\nWe are in love and have been talking about our future together, are planning future trips and so on, and she's set to come back to my country in a year. The future is on paper looking really bright and i look forward to it so much.\n\nBut i'm so scared this LDR situation is gonna ruin our plans and dreams for the future. I'm scared of becoming a ghost. An annoying notification she has to answer. A routine call. A figment of her imagination that she only vaguely remembers from our past memories together. A name that doesn't invoke any feelings in her. A \"don't worry about him\". Scared of becoming \"the backup\". Scared of becoming the second choice. \n\nBecase our physical connection isn't there anymore. No oxytocin or hormones to physically remind our minds and bodies of the love we share for each other. No direct real-life eye contact to look into each others hearts. No affection apart from the vibrations and light emitted by our phones and digital devices.\n\nI'm scared she'll fall into the trap of the new, seductive, thrilling and *real* offers she'll be given by guys she meets during her gap year. They can provide so easily, what she so desparately will miss from me - physical intimacy. The simplest of all. And that is where i suspect she'll fall in.\n\nAlso, brazil has Carnival in february, and i'm pretty sure i won't be able to be there with her. She has already said to me she wants to attend. In the past she has also said that she has kissed a ton of people at past Carnivals. In this case it is the nature of Carnival and i would maybe still take her back if it doesn't go beyond that, but it is still a big threat to our relationship. I'll be stuck here in front of a screen studying whilst she's out at the #1 place people dance on- and kiss each other. \nI already see the end date of our relationship written above my head, serving as a reminder of how i won't be able to provide enough love to keep her this year, and how she's young, beautiful and still wants to take advantage of that.\n\nI don't blame her. I think what all this is about, is that i, myself, if i was a 19 year old woman who only had one partner, wouldn't lock myself in a relationship already. I would explore the options out there, and then maybe come back if i really liked that partner (me in this case).\n\nI feel a dark space forming in my mind - a space of dread, heartbreak, emotional confusion, and lack of hope. And biggest of all, a big timer, counting down the days until we eventually break up because she wants to get out there \"on the market\". It feels horrible. \n\nMy question is - what should i do? Should i talk to her? What can i do to calm my impending feelings of heartbreak and doom down. And if she really wants to kiss and go crazy at carnival, why shouldn't we just break up now?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/SparkyJambalaya_1594", "user": "u/SparkyJambalaya", "text": "How can I (18NB) help my boyfriend (18M) through his lack of motivation?\n\nI really hope this post makes sense and covers all the bases it needs to. I can definitely clarify anything in the comments. I just really some advice on what I should do in this situation. Has anyone else loved someone who had a loss of motivation, and how did that work out? \n\nSome context: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18NB) have been happily dating for about a year and 2 months now, mostly long-distance, but now we live about 30 mins from each other. The honeymoon phase was like no other. We clicked so well on so many different levels, had similar goals for our futures, ideas about life, and dreams of what we could become together. He gave me sweet little gifts, always had the time and space to talk, supported me through a harassment incident (which is now resolved), and basically was everything I'd ever wished for in a partner. Intimacy was fantastic in all its forms, and not a day went by that I ever stopped wishing for more. I know it seems naive to say we were perfect, but it really did seem like we were. I was so certain we were a forever couple.\n\nBut recently things have started to shift. After a rough period during the summer that we patched up, the school year began to put a lot of stress on us both. I noticed that he began to pull away, saying he wanted to be more present and foster more friendships. I have been taking so many classes that my one reprieve during the day was spending all the time I could with him. As he pulled away, I anxiously drew closer, which spiraled us into the place we are now. Our intimacy has tanked, the small things we did for each other are dwindling into nothing. We barely text, and the time we spend with each other is feeling more and more empty.\n\nOn Friday I held a small party, and he ended up just staying the night instead of braving the city traffic back to his place. He'd been pretty distant during the party, and I didn't know what was going on. So as we were headed to bed, I decided to be a bit more assertive about the lack of intimacy I have been experiencing. About a week or so ago my boyfriend and I had a talk and he said that it would really help him if I could be more honest and assertive about what I need and want from him. So, I thought that night would be good to be honest about what I needed.  \n\nI didn't go exactly how I expected. He ended up coming clean about feeling unmotivated and suffering with so much self-doubt. Being at college has made him feel like nothing he will ever do is going to be enough to rival what anyone else does (he's in an arts school), and it makes him want to just give up. He said it would be easier to be alone, to feel nothing, to stop hurting everyone around him. He cried a lot, the first time he's ever done that in front of me. He said he knows he loves me, but he just can't feel it right now. He can't see our future when the future is so daunting. Everything is just impossible. I thought about leaving, but I want to help him work through this.\n\nYesterday we had a longer, more coherent call about everything that's been going on, and he's going to see the school counselor and uncover why he's starting to put so much pressure on himself. We likened the issue to restoring a painting: sometimes the old varnish needs to be removed to reveal the vibrancy underneath. It went incredibly well, and that call truly did feel like us, the old us. We cried, laughed, and got very deep with each other. I really am starting to understand the pressure he's under right now, and we're building some plans to regain at least parts of our relationship.\n\nBut all that is just a start, and I know there's going to be lots of rough days in our future as we work through this together. I still really want to do this together, so comments saying to break up without any other reasoning are probably a little unnecessary, sorry. I'm really looking for advice on how I can support him through this period, and what happened to any other couples experiencing burnout and lack of motivation. I believe our relationship can be repaired and return to its former glory, and I still see our forever.  \n\nSorry this was so long, but **TLDR: My boyfriend (18M) and I (18NB) have been together for 1ish years, and everything was great until school started, and now he's suffering from lack of motivation for his future that's impacting our relationship. He wants to change and is trying, and I want to know what else I can do for him?**", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Everything went great for the most part and then a few weeks before my areas rodeo came up, i mentioned to him that i might go because i go every year. So let’s fast forward to the day before i go and i told him that my mom talked me out of it and i didn’t really want to go anyway because the same people go every year and what not, and then he says “i think you should go i think it’d be very fun” (keep in mind he does not remember saying this or even remember having this conversation but i do and i swear on my life he said this), and then i said to him that it would probably start an argument… and then he said that it definitely would…. okayy???? then don’t say it would be fun to go to..\n\nSo I went, and I told him and I even pulled in while on the phone with him. I walked to the dance and saw Shyanne dancing with a dude, and just stuck around to make sure she was safe. We ended up at Cj’s campsite since that’s where she was staying, but I started greening out from smoking and went to my car. Cj, who’s my brother’s friend and someone I trust, came to check on me, and I told him I felt like I was gonna throw up. He told me to lay down inside, so I did and just went to sleep. The second night, my boyfriend ignored me all day and all night no matter how many times I called. I got super upset and ended up drunk and crying, and then my ex randomly showed up, which was just a whole thing. Two guys came around with Sharpies wanting signatures, and I only signed their necks and let them sign my back…nothing else…because I was still respecting my relationship. After that, I just grabbed some food and called it a night. On the last night, I stuck with Adriana and Shyanne again. We went out with some Wisconsin guys who told us they had girlfriends which made Adriana, Shyanne and I pretty comfortable, ate, bought swimsuits, and went swimming in the river. Later at the campsite the Sharpie guys came around again, but I didn’t let them sign me this time. My ex was still hanging around, apparently because he came just to see me, but Cj didn’t even want him there. Around midnight the cops showed up because of a fight, and they started checking for underage drinking, so the three of us girls just stayed low in the camper until they left. When it was finally time to sleep, it ended up being Shyanne in the middle, me on one side, and Cj on the other, but I was already knocked out before they even got in.\n\nso now the tea really begins:\n\nmy boyfriend started getting all sorts of texts saying that i was cheating.. that i was sleeping with Cj, Flirting with guys, knowing that all of the guys that were in the camper with all of girls, can say that i wasn’t cheating or flirting, there was rumors of apparently me getting an STD and how i did cocaine which i can literally get get someone to confirm isn’t true because i literally had DRILL THE NEXT MORNING .. oh and someone brought up how when i was blackout drunk in June (after boyfriend ended things with me the first time) that apparently i slept with a dude, and i don’t remember it all. someone had to tell me that it happened when i woke up the next morning.\n\ni knew who it was that organized the group and SAM had my boyfriends number. because i seen the names on the snapchat screenshots. these were people i didn’t even know and people that didnt like me that were coming up against me to get my boyfriend to break up with me. it was my ex, Sam.\n\neverything was fine, after we talked about it until i sent a message along the lines of “is everything okay? things just don’t seem intimate anymore and you don’t really want to talk to me?” i tried to put the conversation off and then he told me we needed to talk about it now. so i called him and he basically told me that he can’t trust me, i was obviously confused because he said he believed me just a few days ago.. and i just straight up told him, im not going to be with someone that doesn’t trust me. i say that we should be done. he says “i guess this is goodbye” as i was expecting him to fight for me…i hung up and i blocked him on every social media platform..\n\nlike what do i even do in this scenario??\n\nTL;DR: Went to my town’s rodeo with my friends, stayed respectful the whole time, but my ex stirred up rumors that I cheated/partied wild; my bf believed the hearsay over me, so we ended things.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We moved in together with 3 of our other friends, and lived as platonic roommates. We confided in each other all our dating woes, cooked together most nights, and continued having fun nights out. During that time I grew equally close to my other roommates, and had a casual Covid lockdown fling with one who is now one of my closest friends (shocker).\n\nAfter 3 years of living together, I had finally (mostly) gotten over my feelings for Franky. We were both casually dating other people and in a good place. I had spent many holidays with his extended family as his best friend, and was content knowing that I had a life long friend. Then he had a big health scare. It ended up not being anything major, but at the time put a lot of things into perspective for the both of us.\n\nThe night Franky returned from the hospital we had a heart to heart. I cried as I told him how scared I was during the emergency and it ended with us both deciding to try dating seriously.\n\nWe moved out of the group house with our friends to a small condo together. It took some time to change from an awkward platonic relationship to a truly romantic one, but we allowed the relationship to take its own time and course.\n\nIt’s been 3 years together now. He is currently cradling our shared cat as we plan a romantic weekend get away to New York. He was right, after the one year mark we sat and had a big talk. We talked about what each of us needed to work on to continue the relationship. Instead of it being a relationship death sentence, it lead to both of us getting therapy, making positive changes, and brought us even closer.\n\nWe now have such open communication that even after 3 years we have not had a fight. I could not be happier to have my person, as well as the wonderful family that I now get to be a part of.\n\nTLDR; after 3 years of remaining besties, a mortality check pushed us together.

{"id": "u/Slow-Hat1748_599", "user": "u/Slow-Hat1748", "text": "I (21/M) feel unwanted by my girlfriend (22/F) in our 9-month LDR\n\nHi Reddit, this is my last resort. I don’t have close friends to talk to about this, and I’m honestly at a breaking point. I (21/M) have been in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend (22/F) for almost nine months. She’s my first serious relationship and I love her deeply, but when it comes to intimacy, I feel constantly confused, undesired, and hurt.\n\nShe has depression and started medication two or three months before we met. Early in the relationship, she was flirty, gave signs that she liked me, and spoke about intimacy in ways that made me feel wanted. A few months in, she told me she had made out with another guy at her gym. At that time, we had met in person a couple of times, but she hadn’t done that with me yet. Hearing it crushed me. I felt jealous, inadequate, and like I wasn’t enough. We fought, cried a lot, and eventually I forgave her because I saw her efforts before that incident. But it left a lasting scar.\n\nSince then, our physical intimacy has been limited. We cuddle, kiss, and hug, and she sometimes initiates affection. On calls, she tells me she misses me and wants to cuddle. So she’s not cold or distant. But when it comes to deeper sexual intimacy, it feels like I’m always the one initiating or asking for things she did naturally with others in her past. There have been a few times when I confronted her directly, crying and expressing my insecurities, asking why she refuses to be more intimate, and after those emotional conversations, we did have moments of intimacy. These moments happened a handful of times, but only after I pushed or after emotional breakdowns. Most of the time, if I try to engage without that buildup, she refuses or responds minimally.\n\nShe has said that the medication affects her libido and mood. She has suggested trying things like sexting or masturbating together, and we’ve had conversations about exploring each other’s needs. But almost every time, these ideas don’t turn into real follow-through. I will initiate flirtation or intimacy, and the most I usually get is a giggle, a small “thank you” or “mmm,” and then the moment dies or she falls asleep. This leaves me feeling rejected, inadequate, and like I’m constantly asking for something that should come naturally.\n\nRecently, I accidentally saw her browser history and realized she watches porn. That discovery hurt even more. It made me feel like she has sexual energy, but she doesn’t share it with me. I haven’t told her I know, but it’s added to my insecurities.\n\nAll of this leaves me feeling unwanted, unattractive, and constantly comparing myself to her past. She has told me stories about making out with guys who turned out to be assholes, and I can’t help but feel jealous that she was more physically forward with them than with me, the person who loves her and treats her well. At the same time, she does show affection in other ways, so I’m stuck between feeling loved and feeling undesired.\n\nI don’t want to shame her for having depression or being on medication, and I don’t want to pressure her. But I also don’t want to spend the relationship feeling like a second choice or constantly inadequate. I’m struggling to reconcile my love for her with the hurt and insecurity I feel. I keep overthinking and feeling undesired even though she reassures me that we’ll try things and figure stuff out.\n\nI used ChatGPT to help frame my thoughts, so please don’t mind my phrasing English isn’t my first language. I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has perspective on how to handle intimacy challenges in an LDR where one partner has low libido due to medication, depression, or past experiences.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nI (21/M) am in a 9-month LDR with my girlfriend (22/F) who has depression and started meds before we met. Early on she was flirty, but now she rarely initiates sexual intimacy and I feel undesired. She made out with another guy early in the relationship, which left me insecure, and recently I found out she watches porn, making me feel worse. I’m always the one initiating intimacy, and the few moments of deeper intimacy usually only happen after emotional breakdowns or serious confrontation. She suggests trying things like sexting or masturbating together but rarely follows through. I love her but feel inadequate and unwanted. I’d appreciate perspective from anyone who has navigated similar challenges in an LDR.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Just for reference, if there had been some sort of medical emergency with them, all of this is null. The problem is, I just don't know.\n\nI have been seeing this person for more than a month now, and when things are good, they're great. We both like the same music, we both have the same family goals, we both share a lot of the same political and religious ideas. We can spend all day talking if we had the time. I really enjoy their company.\n\nThe biggest hurdle, and this has genuinely made me reconsider the relationship, is that there have been times where they will just disappear for days at a time. Like, we are talking 3-4 days. (Note, they do not currently have a cellular data plan, so they rely on public Wi-Fi). The first time it happened, they explained the situation. There was a medical emergency in the family and they couldn't get a hold of me.\n\nLike alright sure, but the least they could have done was like, text me and tell me what's going on right? Most hospitals I've been to have public Wi-Fi. There was no warning beforehand, and sure things happen but there was also no notice during either. It was only until after that I found out what happened.\n\nWe talked about it afterwards and they told me they would do better about letting me know when they can't get a hold of me, and things were good for about 2 weeks but now they have disappeared again. The last I heard from them, they were driving a friend to their primary care physician and that they had some work lined up later. \n\nLike okay, I'm happy they have work lined up. Life's hard, we all need money; but that wasn't scheduled until Monday, so why haven't I heard from them this whole weekend? Surely at some point you would decide \"Let me drive to a gas station or Walmart or something and use their Wi-Fi to check in\". Back when I didn't have a cellular plan I was pretty much never without internet, and I live in the middle of no where. That's just how good public and private infrastructure is nowadays.\n\nI talked to a friend of mine and he told me \"Once is a fluke, twice is a coincidence, three times is a habit\". My thing is, this has happened twice in the span of a couple weeks. If this is just a coincidence, it's a very, very strange coincidence. Like, don't you think if they wanted to check in, they would? Surely, surely they had plenty of opportunities, barring any real medical emergencies that would incapacitate them.\n\nAm I overthinking?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We actually spent six weeks on vacation together recently, and things were amazing. When we’re physically together, I usually feel pretty secure and happy. But every time we separate, I find myself spiraling with anxious thoughts.\n\nFor example, this morning I texted her “good morning” and didn’t hear back for a couple of hours. I knew she was awake, and I caught myself thinking things like, “Why isn’t she replying? Is she losing interest?” Later she called, but I missed it while having breakfast. When I called back, she didn’t pick up — which makes sense because she’s at work — but even then, I felt rejected. My brain goes straight to, “She doesn’t care enough to tell me she’s at work” or “She should’ve texted me she’ll call later.”\n\nIt’s exhausting. I know she’s the opposite of me — she doesn’t overthink this stuff, and she shows me a lot of reassurance when we’re together. But when we’re apart, I feel powerless and helpless. Even things like journaling, walking, or meditation don’t seem to stop my mind from going back to the same thought: *“She’s annoyed with me, she doesn’t want to talk to me.”*\n\nI keep asking myself: do I need to change? Do I need to be less anxious and just learn to trust more? Or should I be open with her about what I need, like asking for a quick text when she’s busy, even if it feels like a “ridiculous” request? I don’t know what’s normal and what’s too much.\n\n\n\nSo my question is:  \nHas anyone else struggled with this kind of anxiety in a long-distance relationship? How did you deal with it? Did you find ways to self-soothe, or did you communicate your needs to your partner? How do you find the balance between trusting and asking for reassurance?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/OrganicKale186_179", "user": "u/OrganicKale186", "text": "Found my boyfriend’s Twitter account… I don’t know how to process what I saw\n\nHi everyone, I really need some advice right now.\n\nThis morning I installed Twitter and followed my boyfriend’s account, the one he gave me just the other day. I didn’t think much of it, since he handed it over without hesitation, and I already knew he’s very active on Twitter. But when I started browsing through his feed, I was honestly shocked by what I found. It wasn’t hidden at all, just out in the open.\n\nFor context, we’ve been in a long-distance relationship since 2020 (5 years now). We’ve never met in person yet, but we’ve never had a serious fight that put our relationship at risk. That’s why I don’t even know how to react to this.\n\nThe first thing I checked was his following list, and I saw about 10 OnlyFans accounts. This already felt off to me because I’ve complained about this before (on Instagram). Back then, he told me he unfollowed them and that it was just from way back. But now it’s happening again on Twitter.\n\nThen I went through his replies, and that’s when it really hit me:\n\nTo a girl’s picture, he asked AI (Grok) to edit her photo into a skirt with her tongue out.\n\nTo another, he replied: “my dick is hard.”\n\nAnother reply: “Want my family to gangbang u f***ing slut.”\n\n“Such long legs” on a bikini photo.\n\n“Masturbate to u in the streets.”\n\n“Now post boobies.”\n\n“Such lovely breasts 😭💗.”\n\n“Post nude for the boys.”\n\nTo a question about how he’d spend $1,000, he replied: “OnlyFans.”\n\nOn a girl’s video: “This is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen.”\n\nAnd the one that shattered me most: he shared a screenshot (looked like WhatsApp). In it, he sent a photo of a black couple where the guy was grabbing the girl’s butt, captioning it “you and I soon.” The person replied, “yes sir but I’m not black,” and he said, “Posting this on the internet.”\n\nAll of these were posted around 2022-2024\n\nI honestly don’t know what to do with all of this. Part of me feels completely betrayed, another part of me is just numb. He gave me his account openly, so I’m confused why he didn’t hide any of this. I don’t even know how to bring it up or whether this is something I can come back from.\n\nOn top of all this, I’m struggling with when and how to bring it up. He just started a new job that he and I been waiting and praying for over the past month, and it’s a huge step for his career. The company is in another city, so he’s about to move and start this new chapter in his life. A part of me feels hesitant because of that, like I don’t want to weigh him down while he’s busy and focused on this transition. At the same time, I feel like I’m sidelining my own feelings, and it makes me pity myself for even thinking that way.\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/s/Yu6IM1w8V4", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I’m gonna go by Doe (19M) and let’s call her JB (18F).\n\nWe’ve been together for a year. We’ve had some arguments, but usually we talk them out and make up. On Monday, though, she broke up with me. We had already been on a 3-week break after an earlier incident. I’ll explain.\n\nI’ve had other relationships before, but this one felt different and real. We met in person around 6–7 times. First time was at her aunt and uncle’s house. Second time, we split an Airbnb half-and-half — cooking, watching movies, going to the park, late-night drives, sleeping together, smoking, holding hands. We were so close. I even went to her prom as her date and we took tons of photos.\n\nThe first big issue was in June during a school trip in NYC. I was upset at how she spoke to me, so instead of sitting with her and her classmates, I walked away and spoke to her teacher. She cried, left with her friend, and texted that I embarrassed her and wasn’t her boyfriend anymore. That break lasted about a week and a half. I apologised, promised it wouldn’t happen again, and started therapy. She told me I needed to mature, and I tried.\n\nIn August, we reunited at another Airbnb. She hugged and kissed me when I arrived, and the trip was great. Cheesecake Factory, the park, the beach, seafood boil, her favourite diner — we cried when saying goodbye at the bus station.\n\nBut later in August 26, I argued with my roommate and called JB for advice. While screen-sharing, she asked what sites I’d been on. I admitted I had watched one explicit instructional video before our trip — literally one video on how to please her. I showed her my history to prove it, but she was disgusted and said I betrayed her. I apologised many times, surprised her with her favourite foods and coffee, wrote long messages about how much I loved her.\n\nShe kept saying she needed space. It hurt, since we’re long-distance. She sometimes told me she still loved me, which confused me. I gave her a few days, but after three weeks I finally asked where we stood. I reminded her of everything we’d been through, even how she once told me I was her safe place after her emotional support cat was sold.\n\nShe told me she cries herself to sleep and misses me, but doesn’t think she wants a relationship right now. She said she needs to focus on herself after graduation. That broke my heart. She also said the NYC incident is still stuck with her, even though I’ve been working to change. She claimed our serious talks drained her, and she didn’t want couple counselling or weekly check-ins.\n\nI felt like she was weaponising the past against me; she said I was manipulating her. We argued, and later I had a panic attack, collapsed, and ended up in the hospital for a day. I told her, and she was worried, but even before that she had said she didn’t want to date anyone right now — maybe in the future we could reconnect.\n\nWhat confuses me is that when we first met, she pressured me to ask her out, and I resisted because of past heartbreak. She was the first person I could cry to in years. Now I feel like my time was wasted.\n\nWe still share our locations on Life360, but I don’t know what to do at this point.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He calls me his queen, tells me I’m everything to him, and I genuinely feel cared for and happy.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I’d like some perspective on:\n\n•The speed of the relationship: He told me he loves me about 2 months in. He’s already talking about marriage and children and is planning to fly to my country soon to meet my parents and formally ask their permission.\n\n•His sexual openness: He sometimes asks me for pictures, and when I send him regular outfit selfies, he’ll tell me he masturbated to them. I don’t know if this is common behavior for men or if it’s too much too soon.\n\n•His past relationships: His most recent ex is a celebrity from our home country who has publicly shared that she was raped by another rapper before she dated him. Our country unfortunately has a high HIV/AIDS rate, which has made me a bit anxious about sexual health in general. I’d like to ask him to get tested before we become physical, but I’m nervous about how to bring it up respectfully.\n\n•Dating history & preferences: He avoids the subject when I ask how many women he’s been with, which makes me think it might be a lot. He’s mentioned he usually prefers curvier women, and all of his exes look nothing like me — I’m quite slim. He’s also made comments about younger women being “better” and said he’s always wanted a “trophy wife.”\n\n•Appearance-related comments: I have light brown hair that can look golden in the sun, but he insists I’m blonde and says he’s always wanted a blonde wife. I know he means it as a compliment, but it sometimes makes me feel like I don’t measure up to this ideal image he has in his head.\n\nOverall, he treats me very well, and I do feel happy with him — but I also want to make sure I’m not getting swept up in something that’s moving too quickly.\n\nQuestions I’d love advice on:\n\nIs this kind of intensity normal in new, long-distance relationships, or does it sound like love bombing?\n\nHow can I bring up the topic of sexual health and testing without making it uncomfortable?\n\nHow do I know if I should slow things down, and what’s a healthy pace for a relationship like this?\n\nAre his comments about younger women, curvier women, and “trophy wives” harmless preferences, or should I be concerned about how he views women?\n\nHow do I keep my insecurities in check when he compares me (even indirectly) to his ideal “type”?\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts and any practical advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

What do I do?\n\nI was in a long-distance relationship for 1.5 years. We only saw each other about 32 days total, but we always made it work planning visits, texting every day, telling each other “I love you” and “I miss you” throughout the day like normal. Just 38 days ago, out of nowhere, she pulled away. She went quiet for a few hours one night and then texted that she “couldn’t do the distance anymore.” We never even actually said the words “break up.”\n\nWhat makes it worse is how sudden and extreme the shift has been. Just two weeks before, I had visited her, and we’d been planning her next trip to see me. Tickets were bought, time off was arranged. Nothing felt off. But the night she ended it, it felt like she wasn’t fully herself. Since then, her family has noticed the same her mom says she’s been fighting with her, her sister says she hasn’t been home, and she’s been drinking a lot more than normal.\n\nHer sister even told me she saw a bruise on her face when she managed to see her for just a couple of minutes. And to make it more complicated, this new guy came into her life literally days before this all happened. From what her sister and others know, he’s got a history of abusive behavior. Given her past with an abusive ex, it’s terrifying to think she might be getting manipulated into something again. She’s basically moved in with him, cut herself off from family, and done a total 180 from the person I knew.\n\nHer sister has stayed in contact with me because she’s worried too. We’re both trying to figure out how to handle this without pushing her further away. If this is manipulation, she may not even see it until it’s too late. Her sister even mentioned that if things get worse, she might want me to fly down to support when they confront her not just for me and her relationship, but because we both care about her safety and mental health.\n\nI know my relationship with her may never be the same again, but I still care for her more than I can explain. I’m heartbroken, confused, and destroyed by how this all went down. She was the one who made me believe I mattered, and now I feel like I’ve lost that.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. Do I step back and wait? Do I prepare to step in if her family finds proof?

{"id": "u/volusp_690", "user": "u/volusp", "text": "Boyfriend's ghosting me after an attempt to talk about our future (F24/M28)\n\nWell, this post will most likely turn out long enough, so whoever took their time to read it, I greatly appreciate it, thank you very much.\nI guess that the problem is way more complicated than the title says, so please let me give some background information.\n\nMe and my boyfriend have known each other for almost three years, out of which we've been a couple for a bit longer than a year and a half. The first five or six months were almost perfect, then we had a couple of very unpleasant situations (which was his fault, and he admitted it too), we had some misunderstandings and things like this, but we quickly got through it, so our relationship was fine until the end of February. Then he did something that hurt me a lot: basically, there was an issue on his side that was affecting our relationship while we were on a holiday, I asked him three times to talk to me about it and he promised me to do so, but eventually he didn't say a single word even when we were parting ways at the airport. When we returned each to their own country, I was really offended, because like I said, his actions hurt me A LOT, and that's when it all started. Alongside with this situation, I brought up some other issues that I'd tried to discuss with him a lot of time ago but didn't yield any results, so basically, we've been almost constantly fighting since March. Or rather, he's been either avoiding me or apologising/saying what a bad person he is/saying I was right, and I've been trying to talk to him and eventually losing my patience and getting mad because all our conversations haven't led to anything at all. With his neglection, he made me go though a severe depression that lasted four months and almost made me develop an eat*ng d*sorder, as I was barely able to eat anything. Considering recent events, I think I'm just an inch from going back to this condition.\n\nOne of the issues that were raised was the plans for our future. Some explanation here too, so that it'd be more clear why it affects me so much: he's a EU citizen, he has a comfortable life, a kind, loving family, and an average job that he actually likes. I'm a poor girl from a third-world totalitarian country, I went through a huge lot because of my mother who mentally abused me my whole life, and the only reason why I have a place to live is because my only two friends who are a couple allowed me to stay with them in their apartment for some time. I can't afford anything to rent because of how high the prices are, and the only place I can go is a single bedroom apartment where my mother and sister live. I never had any other relationship, this is the first time for us both. He knows everything about my life and me, just in case. Before I started dating my boyfriend, the only plan I had in mind was to flee the country as soon as I graduated from university (I graduated last December), and then at least not end up homeless in an unfamiliar place, because I knew that I had no future and I didn't even dare to hope to once be able to rely on someone other than myself. To be completely honest, I was sure that my life would end up with a su*cide one way or another, because I knew that nobody cared about me and I didn't know if I'd be able to put up with this fact.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship, he'd say so many sweet words, he promised to marry me, that we'd live in our own house where I'd have my own room, which I've never had, that he'd do everything to make me feel the level of love and appreciation that I deserved. For the first time in my life I had hope to become a normal person, to have my own family, to feel loved and needed. But at the same time, I knew that given the drastic difference in our circumstances (and the fact that he wanted us to live in his country, where housing and job crisis is the main issue), we needed a plan. And me especially, because unlike him, I can't just live my best life with my family unbothered by the future. I made first attempts to talk about it last autumn, and he told me that yes, he wanted a future with me, but every time I tried to have this conversation, he suddenly seemed to be terse and distant. Eventually he said that we'd start discussing it after my graduation, so I agreed with him and thought that our second meeting in February would show us both how well we get along when we're physically together (and we actually do, much better than when we're long-distance, that's what marvels me). So I patiently waited right until March, and I have to admit, I really hoped that this time he'd be the one to start this conversation, because all the time before that it kind of felt like I was the only one who cared about it.\n\nWhen I brought up this issue in March, after the fight we initially had that I described in the beginning, we stopped mid-convesatiom, as he was feeling very sleepy and asked me to continue later. But 'later' didn't happen neither the following day, nor the week after that, which got me very upset and led to another fight, etc. During these reoccurring fights that'd happen between periods of him being distant/ghosting me, he told me that after all the times he hurt me, he was no longer sure that he'd be a good boyfriend for me. I tried to tell him that only he could change it and become the man he wanted to be for me, that all those fights meant nothing to me as long as we listened to each other and tried hard for our relationship. Then it turned out that he wasn't sure that we'd find a place to live or that we wouldn't eventually break up, that he was feeling responsible for my whole life, considering my circumstances. Again, I really tried to reassure him and to explain that he wasn't a messiah in my life, because I'm a grown up person that survived through a lot of things without him. Despite the fact that I felt extremely anxious about my own future, I agreed to wait for some time until we stop having fights and get our relationship back to normal, so that he could see things from a clear perspective.\n\nBy the end of July, we finally, finally seemed to talk like two normal people again, we even made plans to meet again and in August I applied for a visa to go to his country for Christmas and meet his family for the first time. But even so, I just couldn't get rid of this anxiety related to the future. It's been a long time since my graduation already, my friends are planning to sell their current apartment and buy a singe bedroom one instead, so I won't be able to stay with them forever. I mean, even if I had the same citizenship as him and was living across the street from him, I think it's a completely normal and necessary step to understand what expectations you should have of your relationship. Not to mention my situation. At the very least I wanted to know when we potentially could move in together and what we could do to achieve it, and with this final plan in my head, I'd be able to make my own smaller plans meanwhile. I'd know what to do and when to act. In addition to this, the news in my country doesn't get any better. It's gotten pretty dangerous and hard to live here, and it just keeps getting worse.\n\nSo at the very beginning of September, I saw another awful event happen, which got me really sad. He of course noticed it, and when I explained everything to him, I intentionally tried to avoid saying anything about him or our relationship. I knew he needed time and space in this regard, so I didn't want to pressure him, despite my own inner suffering. I only mentioned being anxious because my country was making it more and more unbearable to live here and that I didn't know what to do about my future. I mean, what was I supposed to say? Lie to him? He figured out that deep down I was feeling this way because of him too, so at first he told me that he felt useless because he didn't know how to help me in my circumstances, then he started ghosting me again, feeling ashamed apparently. I was the first one to make contact AGAIN and I tried to talk to him. Briefly, we had the following conversation (I'm sorry for basically retelling it, I just don't want to post these stupid screenshots like people often do here out of respect for his privacy):\nHim: Saying for the fifth time all those things about not being sure that we'd be able to make it financially, about being afraid of what'd happen to me if we broke up at some point after the marriage.\nMe: Thouroghly explaining to him that I wasn't trying to make him talk about our future right now, that I knew he needed some time and I was merely sharing with him what was bothering him. I also told that I wasn't a newborn child that'd die the second day after its parents abandoned it, so he shouldn't underestimate me when it comes to us potentially breaking up.\nHim: Out of this long message I sent him, he only responded to the last part, saying that he was the last person on earth to ever underestimate me.\nMe: Saying that then he shouldn't be worried about something that hadn't even happened yet and would hardly ever happen, because I was sure he was the love of my life.\n\nThat's it. It was September 8, and since then he's been simply ghosting me, having left my last message on read. I've been waiting for three weeks for him to say something, and considering that he daily checks in on our chat, he most likely waits for me to say something instead. Yesterday I lost my patience and told him that if that was the reason for his silence, he could keep waiting, because I was done being the first one to reach out all the time and I wasn't going to say anything else. I know that my actual wording perhaps was a bit rude, but I can't describe how humiliated and abandoned his actions make me feel.\n\nHe just read my message yesterday and hasn't replied anything to it since. I don't know if he's going to ever reply to me at all. I don't know if I should be the one to try and talk to him after all, because I'm really tired of doing it literally all the time. We haven't broken up, and at this point I don't know what will happen to our relationship, but I'm so lost and desperate right now. I know that some of you will probably say that he's a jerk and I shouldn't stay with him. Maybe you'll be right. But he's actually kind and smart, and like I said earlier, we don't fight at all when together physically, it all comes down to the fact that he has communication issues, especially when he can't see his interlocutors. And despite everything, I genuinely love him and I'm so afraid of being alone for the rest of my life. I'm only 24, but it feels like I spent more than 60 years on this planet already, I'm so, so tired of everything. I met this man by pure accident, and looking for close connections in your life is such a hard toil. I know I won't be able to survive through countless and countless attempts to find another person that I'll be able to love as much as I love him, even looking for new friends is so unbearably hard for me.\nMy boyfriend once told me that he suspected being autistic, and so many times I've tried to make him undergo an assessment, as I'm afraid that we both might be treating his issues wrong. I don't want to make a drastic mistake and mistreat him just to find out that at some point that I should've been more patient and chosen a different approach. At the very least I tried to persuade him to attend a regular therapist, and he agreed with me, he admits his mistakes every single time, but so far he haven't done anything at all, aside from agreeing with me and apologising. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know what's going on in his mind (and I've told him a lot of times to share with me in such situations). For the very first time I hoped to become a happy person, despite everything, but now I'm afraid to spend my whole life alone. I'm so scared of not feeling loved and needed by anyone, that's the worst thing someone can ever feel. I spent nearly my whole living like this, and I don't want to lose everything and get back to this desperation. With our relationship I managed to get out of it, but it seems like the day when I'll start feeling like a stray dog again is getting closer and closer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

A bit about me, I grew up in a very unstable household to then experience some very traumatic things. I have done therapy and lots of work on myself. I unfortunately have a chronic illness, Chronic fatigue plays a big part in this(note this for later) I am an overthinking, protective and sensitive person while I am also very empathetic, bubbly and truly love life. My boyfriend grew up with a larger family and very strict parents. He is funny, loves to make jokes, kind and a good person. Most days we get along great. Life seems simple and easy with him. He’s a provider which helps me a lot and it’s something he likes doing. Due to my chronic fatigue I do find it harder to work longer hours and end up sick. So being with someone who loves to provide takes a huge stress off me. fyi I do not need him to be financially stable but he helps which is obviously a huge benefit and I always remind him he doesn’t have too and that I want him to get what he wants which he does do! \nAnyways let’s get to my main point. \nWhenever there’s a small comment made that bothers me or something he does that I do and don’t like ends up being an argument. I then feel shut down and that my feelings are invalid which I also tell him!! We just have things here and there that we just don’t agree on and end up meaning a lot to each of us. We are different we both are aware of that. He’s not protective at all, he isn’t a gentleman. Which are 2 things that are important to me in my relationship. He struggles with reassurance (I know most guys do but he really sucks) and out sex drives are completely different. His is a lot higher and mines lower. I enjoy it with him I just don’t want it to be a daily thing. He always listens when I say no so that’s not a problem but I do feel in the long run for him it will be. He also hates how I’m protective(not controlling I promise you) and I think it’s from his strict childhood of not being able to do stuff that he’s worried about. Which I completely get but in my case I really do just care and want him to be safe. Where as in return he says to me “do what you want, you don’t have to tell me” which hurts and I feel dismissed. \nThere is so much more too it but I won’t write forever but I do want to add he left his ex and then went straight into a relationship with me. (I didn’t know) has lied about a few things he said to “protect me” he lives at my house and he doesn’t have a car. His parents and him are rocky, And he doesn’t have anywhere to go if I do break up with him which I will feel bad about because as i mentioned above he’s a good person just not my person I don’t think. He’s trying to hard to be the right one for me but unfortunately I don’t think it’s going to work for either of us. I’m not sure if we just stay together until we both go our own ways or call it now.

{"id": "u/ThrowRAbig_oop_1183", "user": "u/ThrowRAbig_oop", "text": "My boyfriend (27M) lied about subscribing to explicit content and I (25F) am struggling to rebuild trust\n\nMy boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about six months. We’re both busy students who live in different cities, so we usually see each other ~2x/month.\n\n**Incident #1**: Back in April, Instagram suggested a recently created account my boyfriend was following. It had a suggestive username and a VERY busty, revealing profile picture. Curious, I went to the profile and found it was a gaming account with only 10 followers (including him). I soon discovered he was also following the same girl’s art account and main account. She’s a very talented artist, but he “liked” very few of her art posts, but nearly all of her revealing photos. Granted, his liking history was before we met so I don’t hold that against him on its own, but he followed this gaming account *after* we had become exclusive. When I brought this up, he explained she’s someone he met about six years ago through activism, and that he followed her gaming account because he likes to “support people’s hobbies” and added that he thinks she has a boyfriend. He offered to unlike the revealing photos and unfollow the gaming and art accounts, but wanted to keep her main account for “activism connection” (though she hasn’t been doing any in recent years AFAIK). He was very calm when I confronted him.\n\n**Incident #2**: In late July, we were chilling on the sofa and I saw another very exposed cleavage photo sitting on his phone. He quickly turned it away and said, “oh, just a silly subreddit.” Unconvinced, I looked up r/ cleavage…and there it was: the exact photo. When I asked if he was subscribed, he said yes but claimed he “just scrolls past” and had “just been too lazy to unsubscribe.” Later (after more probing), he admitted he did actively look, was also subscribed to r/ tits, and acknowledged he knew it would hurt me but continued anyway. Again, he stayed very calm when confronted, so I wonder if he was trying to seem unbothered so I wouldn’t think he’s guilty.\n\nI should note that my chest is on the smaller side, so I can’t help but wonder if he secretly prefers the opposite body type. I tried to move past the Instagram incident and take his word for why he followed that account, but the Reddit incident makes me feel like it’s not as likely he was just “supporting her hobby.” My trust in him has taken a serious hit from all of this. I also felt it was an insult to my intelligence that he thought I’d believe his “just scroll past” excuse.\n\n**My conflict**:\n-  He is autistic, and I have ADHD and am likely autistic too, so I understand the dopamine-seeking + social nuance struggles. He told me that he might have a minor addiction and had unfollowed other explicit content after we got together, but has struggled to completely cut himself off. I just can’t tell how much is neurodivergence vs. a lack of respect.\n-  He’s been extremely apologetic and reassuring, never got defensive, and insists he finds me attractive and wouldn’t rather be with someone with a larger chest.\n-  But he has a history of staying in unhealthy relationships because he didn’t think he could do better, which makes me wonder if he’s settling for me.\n-  Since this happened, my body image has taken a big hit, and some days I struggle to reciprocate his physical affection. He notices when I pull back, but it seems like he doesn’t fully grasp how much this has affected me.\n-  My mom says I’m overreacting and that “guys are just like that,” but my friend (who introduced us) told me that this seems like a pattern and wouldn’t be surprised if this keeps happening, so it’d be a dealbreaker for her. I told my new therapist about this yesterday, and she agreed this is a big red flag.\n\n**What I need advice on**:\n-  How do I know if this is something that can be worked through with boundaries, or a dealbreaker?\n-  How do I rebuild trust after he deliberately sought out explicit content and lied about it?\n-  For those who’ve experienced similar situations: what helped you decide if the relationship could be saved?\n\n\n**TL;DR**: BF (27M) followed a busty girl’s gaming account on Instagram and later lied about subscribing to explicit subreddits of women with the opposite body type from mine. My (25F) trust is shaken and body image has suffered.

He’s thoughtful and kind, and just the right amount of doting without being too much. It’s been about a month, and things have been progressing at a nice pace. I have just slept over for the first time, and I have a couple of concerns. Both are fixable, but I feel like it’s too early for me to broach them… even though it will absolutely currently affect us. The first is hygiene. His place is immaculate. He definitely showers daily and brushes his teeth, but I need a little more hygiene before hookup. If we just ate pizza, making out with you is gonna turn my stomach. Also, his nether region picks up a lot of scent throughout the day, even if he showered that morning. I love going down there, but my gag reflex is directly related to smells, so between the food kissing and the junk, I just physically can’t do it. I fully acknowledge this might be a me problem, but I also think he probably wants BJs, so how do I communicate that? The other issue is that he 100% has sleep apnea. Like 45 seconds of no breathing, absolute stillness, followed by a sharp gasp and full body twitch. As you can imagine, that is impossible to sleep next to (even with ear plugs). I moved to the couch at about 3am and blamed the cold temperature, but the truth is I simply couldn’t fall asleep because once a minute I was getting jerked by his coming back to life. (He does mention poor sleep, and now I 100% know why).\n\nThere is a real potential here, but I am admittedly not experienced in relationships. How do I bring up these things without being insulting?\n\nTLDR - we have different body hygiene standards and he has sleep apnea bad enough I can’t sleep next to him.

We are the same age but he’s so much further in life: living alone, bought his own place, car, has a good job, a good social circle. I feel like I am so behind, everything he has, I don’t have. \n\nGenerally it would be easier for me to move to him, I speak his language while he doesn’t speak mine, I don’t really have anything holding me here except for my family and even that I’m fine with leaving, as harsh as that sounds. And in general, I think life in the UK would be better for me than life for him in Germany. \n\nWe’ve been together for six months and we have had conversations about closing the gap etc. but I feel that we have very different view points on how this is going to work out, like our timelines are not matching. He thinks it’s as easy as just applying to jobs, getting a skilled worker visa, and I’m set. \n\nI’m doing my driving license now, something that he pushed for which I appreciate to have his support on, I would have liked to move out and live on my own first, preferably in a different city in my country, find a new job here to gain more experience before seriously applying to the UK, because I can’t just apply for “funsies, memes and yolo” like him. I want to put effort into it so I have the best chance of actually getting accepted. How it’s going to work there is another question and issue, like getting to London since he lives in a different city and I don’t think I’ll find a job in my field there, but that’s an issue that can be solved. \n\nI told him from the beginning that closing the gap for real would be at least another year, most likely longer. I know it sucks and i also want it to happen sooner but how is this going to work? Right now I’m doing the license, that’s at least another 2-3 months until I have it, another few until I’m actually very confident in driving alone. Then it’s looking for a job and place to live here, which I don’t want to leave after only a year. I mean, leaving a job after a year that’s fine whatever, but the apartment won’t even be done within a year and I wouldn’t want to move after such a short time and waste all that money. Even if I do leave after a year, that’s still at least another year and a half until I can seriously think about going to the UK. Of course I could also apply to places in the UK at the same time, but with my current CV and experience I highly doubt it’s going to go anywhere. I got really fucked by covid unfortunately and I’ve been trying to gain more work experience and show that I can do stuff, but there’s still doubt in my mind about it. \n\nPlease don’t misunderstand, I love him and I want to be with him. Maybe it’s just my anxiety about everything in general, maybe he’s right and it’s not as big of a deal as I make it to be. If we were in the same country, I would leave everything behind and move to him. If the UK was still in the EU it would also be easier but as it is now, it is not easy for me.\n\nThere is also something to be said about his family. We haven’t met yet but from what he tells me, his parents wanted him to end up with an Indian girl, marry, have kids, etc. and most of all, they want him / us to have a plan. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, but am I wrong in saying we have only been together half a year and I can’t give them a step by step timeline of the next ten years? I asked him if they really expect us to get married within a year and he said they probably do. Of course I want to marry him, kids I am very much on the fence about, but how am I supposed to give him a plan of our life when I don’t even know what next week is going to look like? \n\nWe visit every 6-8 weeks and spend at least a week together in person, we even had our first vacation together recently, video call every day, even when he’s traveling and the time difference is huge. We still make it work. Of course I want our visits to turn into our everyday lives but I just don’t know how to do it right now. \n\nNow, this is completely just my anxiety talking because he hasn’t given me any indication like pulling away, talking less etc. but I’m scared I will lose him. We are best friends and we love each other, how we make each other feel and express our gratitude for each other every day. But I can’t say that I would blame him if he left, I know that my anxiety and me in general can be a lot to handle and I hate that I am putting him through this. I know there are couples who have been together for years before closing the gap and they made it work too. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like when I bring it up, it usually leads to him disagreeing (in a sweet and kind way, but disagreeing nonetheless) because his brain just works differently, which he also already acknowledged as well. \n\nAre there any encouraging insights from people who have been doing this a long time or have already closed the gap?

We've had out ups and downs, and in the last few years his mental/physical health have steeply declined.  The doctors aren't really sure what is wrong with him physically.  Hasn't really responded to the hundreds (if not thousands) of pills the doctor prescribed, so no real improvement of his condition.  Only a steady decline.\n\nBecause of this and extensive workloads (he has a salary job that often works him 15hr days with low pay), it unfortunately results with us having less quality time then I'd like.  To clarify, he is also wfh (and I'm unemployed), so he's always in his office. This has caused many conversations with me feeling like my needs aren't getting met (ie quality time, snuggles on couch just chilling) with his response being that he's slammed at work/ really sick and is in \"survival mode\".

At some point during this conversations, it always devolves into \" I don't understand why you love me. Another guys could easily meet your needs\"  And I try my best to explain, but I personally struggle to verbally explain these types of things.  When emotions are high, my mind runs blank.  I don't do well on the spot.\n\n\n\nOne of the things I always mention is I love how excited he gets when going over a topic of interest.  He could be telling a story about Napoleon(he's a history buff), and he always has a humorous way of telling the story that makes it more engaging.  I love seeing how happy he gets when he's this way.  That or physics, different things occurring internationally.  Different topics of interest we share.  That's how we first met; at my kitchen table with him nerding out about astrophysics. This is usually my go to every time, and his response is everyone gets like that when they are excited about their topics of interest.  And no, everyone isn't.  He's special but I don't know how to describe it differently for him to get it.  So thus here is my post.

In the beginning, when we were still living in the same country, we were sexually active. But a few months into our relationship, my family and I moved abroad, so we’ve been long distance ever since.\n\nAt first, to stay connected, we did sexting and video calls. I was never really into masturbating, but I went along with it because of the distance. Later on, I started working at a physically demanding job that has me walking for hours and lifting heavy things. By the end of the day, I’m completely exhausted.\n\nBecause of that, I asked if we could maybe schedule intimate moments for my days off. He said he understood, but even then it was hard for me. It takes time and privacy, and I live with my family now, so sneaking away for 30 minutes feels impossible. Eventually, I decided to stop doing it altogether so I could focus on resting, errands, and just not stressing about being caught.\n\nAt first, he said he understood again. But since then, he sometimes makes comments that make me feel guilty about my decision. On calls, he’ll act moody or “off” in a way that feels connected to the lack of sexual stuff.\n\nNow I’m starting to wonder does he really love me for me, or is it just about my body?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Her advances have been incredibly bold and confident, so much to the point that I’m convinced she will coerce me if im alone in a room with her. Via social media she has made bold statements like “time for your love”, and when delays got in the way of me arriving to their family’s geographical location she’s made statements like “where were you” along side a picture with seductive eyes while in heels. Basically she talks to me like she’s my woman, which leads me to believe she wanted more than a one night stand, she wants to be my side piece in secrecy. I believe she’s naturally a manipulative brat, and I say this because she’s very attractive (I rate her an 8.5 out of 10) so she’s probably used to getting her way with men. But with me I did not hesitate to reject her proposal as my loyalty belongs to my wife alone. This upset her aunt and probably took a toll on her ego. This aunt began to subtweet me in the most vicious ways, by exaggerating my flaws and shortcomings and trying to subtly convince the family that I might not be trust worthy, ultimately an attempt to sabotage my marriage. I believe she’s trying to “punish” me for not letting her have me. She also might feel envious of my wife (her niece) and probably doesn’t want her to have me. Very recently I discovered that news got out and her behavior was exposed. I honestly wanted to talk to her one on one and say “hey it’s not you, I’m simply just honoring my marriage, let’s move forward as a family in the right direction and we’ll leave this behind us.” The reason is, I didn’t want to potentially hurt my wife from family betrayal. But it’s too late for that, and the aunt seems to be in hiding now, she hasn’t been on social media since news got out. I also haven’t spoken with my fiancée since. Anyways, I would like to ask for advice: when I meet the family in person for the first time, should I expect the aunt to not be present? And if she is, how do I manage the awkwardness? And how might this affect my fiancée, will she likely be feeling embarrassed, betrayed, angry, more protective of me, sad? I need to know before I confront her about it so I know what tone to set. Thank you all in advance.\n\nTLDR: my fiancée’s aunt tried to aggressively seduce me, I rejected her and now she’s defaming my character and trying to sabotage my marriage. Her actions were exposed and now I’m not sure how to deal with the awkwardness nor how to confront my wife.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/throwaway-bettymay_1587", "user": "u/throwaway-bettymay", "text": "Thinking of ending 10+ yr relationship\n\nI would really appreciate the Reddit verdict on if ending my 11 year relationship is the right decision. He knows im considering it.\n\nI (32F) met my partner (37M) when I was 22. I have a history of childhood and relationship trauma. When I met my partner I was heavily depressed and had lost my self-esteem and had shut down emotionally from a toxic relationship and was in therapy while finishing University.\n\nHe's very introverted, and a kind person generally. When we met he was good at cleaning, and accepted my boundaries and we had some things in common. He has always been happy to go with the flow and help if I ask him to do something. \n\nInitially I knew I didnt have any chemistry with him emotionally but I thought maybe love would grow and that it was better than being with someone toxic. However over the years, while weve had good times and bought a home and pets together, theres been a lot of issues:\n\n1. He has always wanted to have his own business so he doesnt have to report to anyone, though his businesses didnt do well for a long time. This meant at times I was the sole earner and I struggled with this mentally as if I lost my job we would risk the house/pets. Financial security is very important to me as I grew up poor and he didnt. When I asked him to step up and get a proper job it was always \"ill do it as a last resort\". I also manage the bulk of home finances and bills and logistics - he pays for half of mortgage and some bills/ad hoc groceries. I pay for and organise everything else.\n\n2. Over the years he became very dependent and I became codependent. He took less and less initiative around the house and if he did do something it would only be cleaning areas he uses most not other joint areas like bathrooms. I took on more and more maintenance, home improvements, and cleaning ontop of working 2 jobs. My neighbour would ask me why Im mowing the lawn and not him (I have a chronic pain issue). He would do things if I asked or would help me, but only to bare minimum standard which just made me feel like it was easier to do myself, and never off his own bat. He spent all his time working on business stuff (that was below minimum wage most of the time), going to the gym and playing video games.\n\n3. We have no emotional connection, and I dont love him. He doesnt show emotion or  talk to me about how he feels and would shut down if I was upset or listen but then just not check in beyond a quick \"how you feeling\" even when he knows Im very depressed or upset about something, which led to me just bottling everything up and repressing all of my own emotions. We also show love in very different ways. He just wants physical, which I have done over the years but it has felt more and more like a chore for me. I however have spoilt him like planning fancy dinners, taking him on surprise holidays (paid for by me), buying him very expensive gifts, cooking him lovely dinners. I dont need to be spoiled, but he never even calls me beautiful or makes me feel appreciated or celebrated or seen in a way I feel loved and valued.\n\n4. Broken trust. Theres been times when I needed him to show up and he didnt, or he made me feel disrespected. A few examples, I was having a severe an asthma attack one night and he reluctantly came to emergency with me (I had to drive). We waited hours, and I could see he was tired so I suggested he go home, though I wanted him to stay but didnt say it - he did go home (I actually suspect he might be on the spectrum? He has very low emotional intelligence). Another time when his business was doing badly, he racked up $15K on my credit card with business expenses. I had to get him a remote job to get him out of debt, and he barely did his job, so I helped him do his job so he wouldnt get fired and could pay off the debt.\n\nI told him in May I was miserable and was thinking about ending things. Since then his response has been to do more house stuff (though still has to ask stuff sometimes) and its still maybe only just maybe 50% of the house cleaning/basic maintenance. He has tried a bit in terms of being a bit more emotional and chrcking in with me emotionally, but it still doesnt feel like he understands me, and one time it felt a bit like he was guilt tripping me by being upset about no sex. He also planned one basic lunch date.\n\nHe said hes trying and that he wants me to be happy but whatever I decide he will accept and wants me to act like things are \"normal\" until then so that he doesnt get anxious. \n\nI just have nothing left to give, and dont love him in a romantic way. I think I know I should leave, but theres nothing that bad about our relationship so idk if Im asking for too much. Hes never mean or hurtful deliberately, he is jusy oblivious and doesnt know how to think about other's needs.\n\nTLDR: nothing majorly wrong, nice guy, but dont feel emotionally supported or loved by my partner of 11 years in the ways I need and feel taken for granted and like his version of \"trying\" is still bare minimum leading me to be very resentful.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I live in Italy and my partner lives in South Africa, we've been dating for 4 years online but we've been lucky enough to to be able to meet many times for long periods thanks to tourist visas and my supportive family. My partner would like to move here but it's proving almost impossible, she was able to study here for a year, and then come by on a tourist visa every few months.\n\nWe attempted to get her to live with me legally, we had every document ready and submitted but a police visit needed to check that she actually resides with me (which was supposed to take 1 to 3 months) never came, it's been almost 2 years, we even went to check at the station 3 months into it and they laughed at us saying it would be at least 6 months. She couldn't work legally without this so she had to go back. We found places willing to hire her but they want her to already have a working visa, working visas seem impossible to get. Working and/or staying without proper documentation would be really easy but I don't want to risk it.\n\nI am in university and I'm lucky enough to have my family supporting me financially through that and further education, as long as I'm performing well (and I always have). However they will not support us getting married until I'm done with education and have a job so that's not an option. I considered quitting school and working but that would not only limit my earning potential but also create a rift with my family. Waiting for the end of my education and getting a job feels so far away (at least 4 more years for master and I would like to pursue a PHD). I wanted to do university in her country but my parents didn't approve of the universities that offered me scholarships over there.\n\nI have interned in religious organizations that help migrants but they seem to only help migrants that get here illegally. I understand their struggles and I would never wish that for my partner, and I love helping them learn Italian and navigate through life in Italy, however when it comes to my partner who is trying to come here legally these organizations can't (or won't) do anything to help.\n\nSo my situation is this, marriage is not an option for a long time, working here seems impossible, studying here is prohibitively expensive for a foreigner. I don't know if my mental health can handle the constant visits that last a few months and then months of not knowing if or when we will get to see each other again. I already had struggles with mental health in my teens and my mood stabilizers/therapy don't seem to be helping much when my life gets uprooted every few months. I have terrible mood swings for weeks before and after she leaves, and only really get better when I can start concretely working on ways to meet again. Recently another tourist visa expired and it's looking like it will be at least  5 months before we can get another one.\n\nMy questions are;\n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences trying to move to Europe?\n\nDoes anyone know organizations that could help with finding a job and getting the proper documentations for someone looking to immigrate?\n\nDoes anyone suffering with mental health issues have any healthy ways to cope with these constant changes and unknowns?\n\nThank you for reading this far, even if you have no way to help I'd love to hear your success stories as they might cheer me up.\n\nTL;DR I live in Italy and am looking for ways to help my partner (ZA) citizen to move here (legally).", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We met by chance in Germany at Oktoberfest while I was living in England and she lives in the US. \n\nI lived in England for 3 years, my visa ended back in May I have since returned to my home country of Australia. The original plan was for her to join me in Australia as she is a qualified Nurse and I have no university degrees. My plan was to always return when my visa ended and start studying to be Nurse/Paramedic which would have been the begin of February next year. \n\nWe decided in the June (2024) after we met that it would make the most sense for her to move to Australia to give me the opportunity to go to University and get a degree and it would be easier for her to get a work visa. I realised the more and more we discussed it that she wasn't very enthusiastic, she never really brought the idea up her self and this led to one of our biggest fights we've had. She reassured me that she would move to be with me but couldn't tell me when it would be. \n\nAs time went on I felt as though for our relationship to work I would need to be the one to move. I did my research and brought up to her that I wanted to move and what our options were, to get married and apply for a sposal visa or fiancée. We had discussed our future a lot at this point and I had it in my mind that I would be proposing before the year was over already. \n\nWhen my UK visa ended I returned to Australia with a stop over in the US to visit for 3 weeks. During this time I proposed the second day of arriving and we arranged our documents and relationship evidence to submit our petition to move me to the US to get married and live there. \n\nI knew there'd be a long wait for the visa, we are currently in month 3 of an estimated 9 month wait for the petition to be approved. This doesn't guarantee a visa there is another process after that and that could take another 5 months. Since I've been back I've been really struggling mentally, being in a place that doesn't feel like my home anymore, seeing old friends I don't feel like I really know anymore. Being back somewhere that I struggled mentally before, which is part of the reason I left in the first place. \n\nI've applied for so many jobs anything and everything I could. Entry level positions and I've only been able to get one interview. In England I was an emergency call operator for 2 and a half year and I applied for that job in Australia but that got rejected. I feel like since I've been back I've constantly had things not work out for me and it's taking its toll. \n\nI talk to my fiancée about it and she tries to support me as best she can but my negativity does take its toll sometimes and I completely understand why it doesn't. Unfortunately I'm in a position where there isn't really anyone can help me. I feel like I'm stuck in a holding pattern waiting for my visa to get hopefully approved but with no clear end in sight. \n\nI'm currently completing my GED to get a high school equivalency certificate to go to University in the US to pursue nursing but I didn't realise it's a longer process than it is here in Australia. I feel like I'm so far away from that goal currently that I dont know what to do with myself or where my life is heading. \n\nAt the end of next months I'm going to visit my fiancée for 7 weeks so hopefully that will help me reset and clear my head and get me out of somewhere I feel so negative all the time. \n\nThanks for reading, I just needed somewhere to get it all out 😤", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TIMEZONE_MISMATCH"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Is this a red flag?\n\nHi Reddit, I need some outside perspective.\n\nI’ve been in a long-distance relationship for a year now. Our birthdays are a month apart. Mine came first when we had only been dating for 3 months. I didn’t expect a gift at all (he didn’t have money), I just wanted him to be the first to wish me happy birthday. He did exactly that—set an alarm for midnight, and I was honestly really happy with that.\n\nThen his birthday came the following month. For a whole month before, he kept bringing up this one item he really wanted but couldn’t afford. I just listened because my financial situation has been rough (I’m the breadwinner of my family since my dad left us with debt, and money has been very tight).\n\nOn his birthday, I wished him happy birthday. His reaction felt kind of… disappointed. Two days later, he asked me directly, “So what are you going to give me for my birthday?” I was shocked and said I didn’t know. Then he sent me a link about a girl who bought her boyfriend an expensive gift and said, “She bought her boyfriend something expensive, but my girlfriend didn’t even get me something cheap.”\n\nThat really hurt. I reminded him that I didn’t get anything on my birthday either, and I never demanded anything. I could’ve compared him to my exes who gave me gifts without asking, but I never did, because I don’t care about that.\n\nWhen I told him maybe he should just date someone richer, he got mad and said, “I don’t need material things.” But it feels like he does—otherwise, why bring it up and compare me to other girlfriends? Meanwhile, he still relies on his parents and even gets gifts from them, while I get nothing and carry all my family responsibilities.\n\nNow I can’t shake the thought: is he just trying to use me financially in the long run? Because honestly, the item he wanted was actually quite expensive in my country’s currency.\n\nTL;DR: My LDR boyfriend didn’t give me anything on my birthday (which was fine), but when his came around, he was disappointed I didn’t buy him a gift and compared me to girlfriends who spend big on their boyfriends.

We had plenty of time together to talk one on one, hang out, go on dates etc. During this time he was just starting his business, and it in no way affected our dating life.\n\nHowever as of the last… I’d say year and a half he has really blown up and his business is doing amazing.

I felt this might alleviate some of his stress, and give him time to decompress. I felt it was fair. He refuses. I’ve discussed how I feel sad that our time always get interrupted. And asked if there was a day during the week/weekend we could set out just for us to spend time together. That worked for about 2 weeks then it stopped.\n\nI’ve told him my feelings. I don’t ever try to make him feel bad in anyway. (I don’t know how it feels to run a business, and I have no interest in running one.)

After leaving an abusive relationship, this felt like a dream. He was sweet, supportive, constantly texting, calling - just making me feel safe and appreciated. Our first in-person meeting was amazing. I felt relaxed, happy, and really present.\nSince then, communication has stayed consistent and good overall, but a few things have been bothering me, and I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if they’re red flags:\n1. None of his friends or family know about me. He says they “wouldn’t understand” because we’re long-distance. I’m just his friend for them, no more. \n2. There are no concrete plans for our next visit. Whenever I ask, he just says “I don’t know.” That is strange, because when we first met, he was eager to make it happen ASAP.\n3. He lied to me “for my own good.” It wasn’t a big lie, but it was unnecessary and honestly pretty dumb. Now I feel like I have to be on guard.\n4. No conversations or steps about a future together. No talk about closing the distance, moving, or how we could make that happen. We’re both adults… not students or in our early 20s… so I feel like this should at least be something we start discussing. \nBesides these issues, I feel really happy and comfortable with him. I’m not the kind of person who dates just for fun. I want a real future - a home, a family, one loving partner to share my life with. The distance is the hardest part, and if I could afford to move, I honestly would. But right now, it’s just not financially possible for me.\nI haven’t brought up the topic of moving or money with him because, truthfully, I’m not even sure how serious he is about all of this. I’m also waiting to have this conversation in person, but the uncertainty around when we’ll meet again is making that hard.\nI’m not great at relationships. I’ve made mistakes before, and I’m tired of getting it wrong. I overthink a lot, especially when I don’t fully understand where I stand.

My long distance girlfriend is going through the worst time of her life as she is grieving the loss of her father from a few weeks ago. I haven’t had the privilege to meet this man but I owe him everything for how he raised her to be such an amazing woman. I want to preface this that what she is going through is truly one of the worst things a person can go through especially since we are so young. I can see her shutting down and being emotionally drained and it breaks my heart. I want to be there for her and I also want to give her the space she needs to process. What I am going through is nothing in comparison to her grief, I know this, but I wanted to know how people can get through the silence and agony of not being able to physically be there for someone at a time like this. We both still love each other and she has her moments where she’ll be smiling and laughing but I know grief comes in waves. So this is followed by days of crying and sleeping. We went from checking in and calling and spending time together over the phone or discord to now I hear from her once in the day and then maybe some time at night when she’s awake. I really feel selfish even being sad about not seeing her, but I can’t reach out to anyone I know because they either dismiss how I’m feeling as being too emotional, or they outright doubt my relationship because it’s long distance. If anyone is or has dealt with something similar and can give me some tips on being better at comforting her or coping with the pain of not knowing how she is, I would be eternally grateful.🥹", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Looking for advice regarding US health insurance, travel insurance, and hospital bills. What can we do?\n\nHi Reddit, this is our first time posting looking for advice. To be honest, it’s kind of a hail Mary. But we're really needing/hoping we could receive some guidance on what to do with my current situation. Apologies in advance for any reddit mistakes and thank you for your patience. \n\nTLDR; My (29M, US citizen) fiancée (30F, Brazilian) is visiting for a couple months on a tourist visa while we wait for her K1-Fiancée visa to be approved. Six days into visiting she was in a grease fire accident which resulted in 3rd degree burns to all of her right arm and hand from the bicep down, her right thigh and the majority of her left leg and foot. She’s now out of the hospital and recovering. Her travel insurance medical expenses are capped out at $150,000 and they said they are not negotiating prices with the hospital, leaving us with potentially over $112,000 in medical debt unless something can be done to help reduce it. This whole thing has been devastating and a nightmare. We've been in an LDR for almost 6 years, and right before we’re finally starting our life together, this happens. Any advice, tips or tricks to navigating this would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n\nA little background on us and the circumstances around her visiting the US. My fiancée and I have been in a long-distance relationship for 6 years come October. We are currently going through the K1-Fiancée visa process and are approaching the final stages, where she will be required to visit the U.S. embassy in Brazil to finish the process.  Back in July, she was amicably released from my full-time job in Brazil. She was given advance notice of her last day, so we decided she should travel to the US for a few months on her tourist visa while we wait. The logic was if she have nothing to do because she’s unemployed, she might as well be here with me during it and help set up the apartment for her permanent arrival. \n\nShe arrived on August 4th and everything was going great. Then on August 9th, while I was away at work she was trying to cook lunch for me. She was doing a deep fry recipe, but it was her first (and last) time ever deep frying anything (her words). The oil started smoking and then caught on fire. She wasn't sure what to do when the flames started to reach the wooden cabinets above the stove, so she tried and move the oil outside onto my apartment’s balcony. While moving the pan a little bit splashed on her hand, resulting in dropping it. The oil spilled onto her right arm/hand, right thigh and close to the entire lower left leg and foot. Thankfully as soon as the oil hit the carpet, the fire went out immediately and no further damage happened, and our dog was completely unharmed. She knocked door to door looking for help and eventually was saved by my downstairs 80yo neighbor, who called me while she got into the shower to manage the pain. \n\nWhen I arrived, I rushed her to the closest emergency room. She was stabilized until she could be transferred to another hospital with a full body burn unit. The only one in the state. She was treated very well by the staff there. Nurses, doctors, therapists, everyone. They communicated great and really helped to keep us as comfortable and at peace as possible. In her words, the only bad part of the stay was the food, but that could be expected, I think. Monday, August 11th was her first procedure to have the dead and damaged skin removed from her arm removed to see if she needed grafts. The doctors ultimately determined grafts would be necessary to all her burns with exception of some small spots from oil splashing on her legs. They started with a \"fake skin\" graft (Allograft) on her arm, and a deep clean of all her wounds. After the procedure, it was the worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Replacing the initial burns as her new 10/10 on the pain scale. \n\nHer second procedure was on August 15th. She had the fake skin removed from her arm, dead tissue removed from her legs, everything deep cleaned again then finally the skin grafts were stapled, with skin being taken from good spots of her thighs and calves. The day after that procedure was the new worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Then they didn't touch any of her wounds for daily cleaning or anything for 4 days. On the 19th, she had all her staples that were holding the grafts in place removed and got her wound care/cleaning (not a deep clean) again. The skin grafts looked pretty cool to be honest. Her arm looked like it was covered in dragon scales. After another 4 days of intense PT exercises and healing, plus some sessions with her PT coach (that I nicknamed Ms. Sunshine) she was doing well enough to go home by August 24th.\n\nNow, thankfully she was fortunate enough to have very good travel insurance through her MasterCard that paid for the trip. It covered up to $150,000 in her medical expenses. By the way, interesting fact, medical expenses covered by travel insurance does NOT count as health insurance. Which was a pain in the ass because we had been dealing with the contracted health insurance company \"AXA\", who struggled to communicate with us and especially the hospital. Adding to all the hassle and confusion and smoke (pun intended), we were struggling/unable to get a solid answer on what they (AXA) were covering, which was very worrisome. When you've been in a state-of-the-art burn unit for 15 days and simply existing in the room cost us over $11,000 a day, she capped out on the $150,000 quickly. IF her insurance actually covers their share and doesn’t weasel out on anything, then the additional costs are one of our last a major issues. \n\nWe still haven't gotten the bill, but we got an estimate with detailed items of $224,400.18 that included medicine, wound care, procedures and the room rate. We were keeping track of that bill almost twice a week but after she was discharged our new estimate also had specific charges for every doctor stacked on. Resulting in a surprise extra sum of $38,553.14. Making the new total expenses $262,953.32 (which is a terrifying prospect). After looking at all the itemized expenses, the only thing that stood out for us (besides the surprise extra charges) was that there was no change in the room price (over $11k) even after we got moved to a different floor, unit, in a room less than half the size and with far less active nursing.\n\nNow, my fiancée and I have decent savings accounts that could help some. But nothing that could cover this potential additional $112,000 in debt. Our savings accounts were supposed to be to help us start a life together, not... this. Aside from the medical expenses her travel insurance covered for her mom to travel here to help take care of her, which has been a huge blessing to both of us. The insurance is also offering to cover both her and her mom’s flights back home to Brazil once she’s recovered enough to deal with airport germs. We simply are overwhelmed and don't know what to do about all this, and we hardly know anything about hospital bills, negotiations or dealing with insurance companies. Plus, the hospital keeps giving us the run around on who to talk to regarding billing or negotiations. \n\nThere's also been a lot of other surprise expenses, all hitting at the exact same time as this accident. It's made our finances even more tight and stressful. This is just overall so difficult to deal with on so many levels, especially when you have no idea the scope of the systems you're dealing with. It's just been a nightmare from start to finish, and it's not even done yet. Please give us an outside view looking in. We're trying to remain calm, but the looming debt gets closer every day. Any relevant experiences, tips, tricks, or advice; it's all welcome. We will also try to answer any questions that are asked.

I’ve tried talking to lawyers about the possibility of me taking him with me as a move-away case, but they didn’t seem optimistic about it. That’s why we agreed on him moving down. He’s already lived there for half of his life and rents a space with his sister and her husband. They’re about to have a baby, and now he feels pressured to stay longer to help out his sister.

BUT when I told him that I was only looking for serious relationships he told me he wasn't cause he just broke up with his ex gf (he broke up like a month ago at this point).\n\nSo of course I felt shitty, but I wanted to give it like a \"try\" I guess. We've been talking and hanging out with friends and stuff, but this last Saturday he asked me out alone, we went to have dinner and then we went to his house and we started watching a movie, and as you audience may suspect, yeah he tried to get physical with me, we kinda did, but I stopped him and he did stopped and apologized.\n\nBut at this moment of my life, I feel the shittiest of shittiest. Because I do understand his point: He just ended a relationship and it's way to soon to start a new one, but I feel so used somehow.\n\nYesterday we had a conversation where I asked him how he felt about me, like what did he want from me, and he said:\n\n\"I'm a little worried about you. You're one of the closest people I have. You're very important to me. But if the question is about relationships, it's something I'm not emotionally available for at this point in my life. I'm still accepting and assimilating a very recent breakup. But you're definitely very important to me. I'm just sure I'm not emotionally available for a relationship right now. I love you very much.\"\n\nSo what you guys think?\n\nThank you for reading all my vomit.

I feel my whole life is falling apart and i see the pieces falling before they happen.. my family are going through this economic crisis as much as i am, but my STUPID brother in law has to yell at me about it. So for context:( i can't drive. Being disabled, never been taught to drive, i can't afford the lessons right now, it's not really a priority as well, and i couldn't afford a car even if i learned and top it off with im SCARED AF TO DRIVE. i work a fair distance from my house currently, it takes me 14/16$ a day to travel to work in the morning.  My brother in law sometimes can take me in the mornings,  but his schedule is changing.. there's no guarantee. I will be spending so much money on just traveling to work. Im worried it'll affect my relationship with my partner too. Im saving money to see him.  Im worried if i CANNOT see him this next year.  We're done.  And I've only made 1/3rd of the savings for the trip.. life in America is getting harder and i hate it here... I'm being set up for failure at every turn..  just when i think things are okay,  i get hit with HARD crap that's unnecessary... i feel like a failure at being an adult or being a normal human at this point. I feel like my family want me gone, and out of the house asap. \"Cuz im ruining their lives, their chance at a retirement, their future\" im scared. I have no other family. And im all alone. I just want to go be with my partner now. Not struggle alone in this life... \nIm legit depressed. I have no friends i can move in with. And even then they can't. I pay 300$ rent rn,  and there's a chance it'll increase. No other place will EVER let me pay that cheap... my brother in law is the problem and i feel he just wants me gone ... my sister doesn't care about me either cuz \"he's the boss \" (even though he cheated on her 3 times with the same woman) she never cares about anyone but keeping her \"man\"... I'm just stuck in this endless toxic environment.... they never clean up after themselves.. and my brother in law yells at me saying \"DISHES NEED TO BE DONE\" but i haven't touched a dish in months. I eat microwave food to avoid this constant yelling at me but it happens.  I shouldn't have to clean up after others. When it's not my mess. This house is filthy and im also sure I'm getting sick all the time from it. I don't leave my room cuz i hate being around him. I don't want to be around anyone.  They judge me,  for even having a ldr, or just existing. My boyfriend has loved me more than them... and they'll never see the toxic parts...\nI feel so alone... and so defeated... and just worthless in this world... im typing this cuz i need advice... options.. i can't be homeless.. i can't stay.. and i can't leave.. I'm screwed.. \nIf i can't work,  i can't save, and if i can't save, i have no relationship with my boyfriend.. and then I'm really all alone....\nIdk what to do.... \nAm at an end of my rope.... and it's going to snap..\n(Also my brother in law makes me uncomfortable being around me physically, i hate when he touches me, without my permission.. he's poked me, tried massaging my shoulders when i say they're sore and it just makes me wanna crawl my skin off. ) i can't say no to anything in this house. My sister never cares... my nephews think I'm useless... i just wanna cry..\nAnd they'll all just tell me it's all in my head.. and im just being \"dramatic\"... no.. im autistic.. i have pattern recognition.... i SEE toxic everywhere rn... \nIdk what to do 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I think I’ve figured out why I'm so restless and always want to break up with him: I’ve lied about practically everything, and I’m confused about what's real anymore.\nWhen we first got together, I saw this as just for fun. Seriously, I thought I’d block him(20M)in a few days. But we got so much further, and here we are.\n\nThe Lie,The Pressure, and The Person I Became :\n\nWhen we started dating, I only showed him my good parts, never my flaws. We were so busy fighting and fixing things that I never found the right time to open up. By the time I realized I should tell him, it felt too late. I was terrified I'd embarrass myself and ruin the perfect image he had of me. I thought he’d stop loving the version of me he knew. It all started because he was the kind of person who made fun of others' insecurities, labeling it as dark humor. I've never been overly sensitive, but since I liked him, I became extra conscious. I felt this pressure to only show him the best side of me. Since it was online, I didn't really have to worry about being exposed, lol. I didn't realize it at first, but soon, pretending to be this perfect person became my whole personality. Instead of getting better in real life, I was working overtime on portraying perfection. It was a stupid decision, but whatever.\n\nThe Whole Truth : \n\nNow, I need to come clean about my history, because he (and you guys) deserve the whole truth. Yes, I was a bright student until 9th grade. But then came 10th grade. I got major depression,not chronic stress I was pretending to look cool about, but constant darkness and suicidal thoughts 24/7 for over nine months. Tears dried up. Four or five belts (slaps) and 10 curses a day was the mandate, and the rest of the time was spent sleeping on the floor in 42-degree heat without a fan. Unsurprisingly, I passed with only 51%. I honestly didn't study a single thing. After that, I spent a whole year on bed rest and didn't study again. The financial stuff is the biggest lie. He used to brag about his dad being a government employee, which led to me spinning this huge lie that,my dad was successful and financially stable,Ugh, I’m so embarrassing. My dad is an asshole who loves to sleep, rots in bed, and procrastinates all week. He lost all his money and businesses and has spent his entire life abusing everyone around him. This is why when my boyfriend says, \"You know your capabilities and how far you can go,\" he scares me,he reminds me of my dad. We live in a small, backward village because my dad can't afford a shelter of our own. He's jobless and somehow manages the rashan(rations), lol. We live in one small, congested, shitty room. We don't even have a kitchen and own absolutely no property. We have no money in the bank and no future security. Imagine having three daughters under this leaking ceiling, and he has loans he hasn't paid. We had to leave Delhi only because we were getting death threats for not paying a loan on time. We're living on the last money from selling inherited land. Once it's gone, we are fucked. Our school fees haven't been paid since last year. Meri soach k gend ftt rhi (My mind is blown) lmao.\n\nThe Present Failure : \n\nThe room I’m living in now? My mom paid for it by selling the **last piece of gold** she had. She wants me to help her and my sister get out of this shitty position. But lol, here I am. I failed 11th grade with 16% because I was busy with online flirting, GCs, and yes, texting my boyfriend and masturbating. I haven't attended school for more than 25 days this year. I haven't completed any syllabus, don't know a damn thing about my subjects, and I'm not even trying. I'm just texting him, feeling low, and then pretending to study in front of her. I know this is a pretty fucked-up personality. But yeah, this is who I am. I condensed all of that into a long, messy text and sent it to him tonight.\nI'm posting this because I can't breathe. What should I do now? Was sending that text the worst decision?

On New Year’s Eve, while drunk, he defined our dynamic by saying, “you understand this is just benefits right?.” I went along with it, but since there has been more couple like or at least intimate activities such as cooking dinner together, traveling, staying over weekly, spending holidays together, day trips, sentimental gifts etc.\n\nA few weeks ago, after we booked a weekend trip, he told me about a conversation he’d had with his best friend. He told me that his friend said, “So you're sleeping together and are now travelling together, so you're dating, right?\". He then told me that he responded to his friend, saying, \"Oh no no no,\" with the friend saying, \"okay well does she know that?\". He then said, \"Oh, she insisted.\" Basically, he lied to his friend, saying that I was the one who insisted it wasn't dating even though that's not true at all, and he's the one who has repeatedly insisted otherwise. \n\nHe placed the responsibility on me. I didn’t even know how to respond when he told me I just sat there in shock. I felt like he'd just thrown me under the bus.

Advice needed.\n\nHey Reddit, I need some outside perspective on my long-distance relationship because I'm starting to feel crazy.\n\nMy (34M) girlfriend (29F) lives in Spain and I live abroad. We've been together for a while (more than 3 years together) and I’m mostly doing all the travelling as I’m more flexible and earn more than she does. For the last year, the plan was decided for me to move to her but sometimes I have my doubts due to quality of work, lack of support network, etc. She is willing to move in the future, but she cannot do that now due to her work.\n\nLately, she's been frustrated that my job search in Spain hasn't been moving as quickly as she'd like. I'll be honest, it's been hard to find the motivation. It's a huge move, leaving my job/family/friends behind is daunting, and the job market is tough. I'm committed, but I'm struggling with the pace.\n\nHere's the current issue: Her friend is having a birthday party in Spain soon, and I really wanted to go. It's a chance to see her and her friends and feel connected to my future life there. I told her I was planning to book a flight and attend the party.\n\nShe got angry and told me that she doesn’t want me to come to the party. Her reasoning is that if I use my money and time to fly over for a \"fun trip,\" it takes away the urgency for me to find a job and move. She says it's a \"waste\" and that I should only come when I have a job secured. She also outright refuses to visit me here for the same reason—to \"force\" me to be the one to make the move.\n\nI feel like this is incredibly manipulative. She's using a fun event I was excited about as a punishment to pressure me into acting faster. It feels less like she's my partner and more like she's my manager withholding a reward.\n\nOn one hand, I get her frustration. She wants us to live in the same country and feels I'm not moving fast enough. On the other hand, I feel like her method is controlling and is making me more resistant and anxious about the entire move, not less.\n\nSo, Reddit, is her tactic a normal level of frustration in a long-distance relationship, or is it a major red flag?\n\nTL; DR: My GF in Spain is forbidding me from visiting her for a friend's birthday party. She says it's to \"force\" me to focus on finding a job there so I can move, instead of taking fun trips. She also refuses to visit me for the same reason.

When he told me he had a crush on that boy he said he “only liked him but didn’t love him the way he loved me”, we talked and I was upset but willing to work through it with him, mostly because of how devastated I was in the moment and how badly I didn’t want to lose him. He told me they only knew each other for a month but “he’s been sending me cute videos and I feel guilty for rejecting him” which honestly leads me to believe he was emotionally cheating on me, even now it still hurts so badly to think about it and I’ve been having reoccurring dreams of him leaving and cheating on me.\n\nI begged him to stay and not leave me for that boy until he turned it back onto me and said I couldn’t be what he needed, that I wasn’t bold enough and didn’t show him the love he wanted or needed, so we went on a “break” because in his words, “I don’t want to see him or you right now”. There’s too much to go over but eventually we got back together.\n\nFast-forward a month, he joined this minecraft game server where he was being flirted with. He invited me to the sever and I was annoyed with the flirting and didn’t like it so I told him, he said it was a joke and in his words again, “this is why I was afraid to invite you, because you take things too seriously. even things\nlike this, I want to be allowed to joke around too” so I let him, he’s russian and so are all his friends so I couldn’t understand what they were saying but I translated it and he was denying that we were together. I left the game after the flirting got too much and since he was ignoring me too, later a screenshot was shown to me of that conversation.\n\nHe urged me to leave the server and completely stop playing so I did and I can only assume the flirting continued but I told myself, “what I don’t know can’t hurt me” and kept living like that. Up until now, he barely texts me, I send him paragraphs about how much I love him, I send him cute videos, I try to be more “bold and brazen” like he wants me to, but nothing seems good enough for him and im\ntired. I invest too much effort into him and this relationship just to get basically nothing back, when actually does respond to something I send he’s dry and uninterested yet I see him posting in his telegram channel and playing with his friends meanwhile I have to beg for even an ounce of attention.\n\nI just need help I want us to work out.

{"id": "u/Whereas master1430_1366", "user": "u/Whereas master1430", "text": "Has anyone actually made a relationship work with such a huge sex drive mismatch?\n\n\n\nI (22F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for about 1.5 years. In the beginning, our sex life was pretty good in that it was fairly frequent and mutual. But over time it’s dropped off drastically to the point where I feel like I’m almost celibate.\n\nFor months I was the only one initiating sex. Around 80% of the time I’d get rejected and he rarely initiated himself. It got to a point where we were having sex probably once every two weeks even though we live 5 minutes apart and spend the night together 3–4 times a week.\n\nI brought up how much this was bothering me and his response was that his sex drive is very low and it’s nothing to do with me. I asked him if there’s anything I can do to turn him on more or if there’s anything new we can try doing / basically make things more exciting and he said he didn’t think so. So it feels like there’s nothing I can even do. The “solution” we agreed on was for me to stop initiating and pull back sexually and he’ll initiate if he’s in the mood. Since then we’ve had sex once in a month. \n\nThe problem is my sex drive is really high. I want sex often and when I’m turned on around him I feel like I can’t do anything about it. When we do have sex most of the time it’s short and I rarely finish so I just feel so sexually frustrated.\n\ni don’t want to be insecure but It is having an affect on my confidence in the relationship. It just feels like he has no sexual attraction to me anymore. I’ve sent him nudes before and his response has been things like just “cute,” which makes me feel like he’s not even turned on by me. So I’ve just stopped sending him nudes too. because we did used to have a good sex life in the beginning I can’t stop wondering what’s changed. It makes me feel like it must be about me even though he insists it isn’t. He once told me that sex with his ex felt like a chore, and now he says his drive is the lowest it’s ever been. So I can’t help but worry that sex with me feels like a chore too. He also used to watch porn and says he doesn’t anymore, but I honestly don’t know if I believe him.

The last time I brought it up he straight up said he was “bored” of the conversation and shut it down. this is l a pretty big issue for me and is causing a lot of sexual frustration and overthinking on my end, and it feels like he doesn’t even want to try to fix it or find a halfway happy. I’m left feeling like my needs don’t even matter which just adds to the frustration. If he’s not in the mood, we do nothing. He doesn’t help me finish anymore and there’s no alternative intimacy and I’m just left sexually frustrated.\n\nOutside of sex he’s really affectionate and loving and our relationship otherwise feels good. That’s what makes this so confusing. I love him so much and I know he loves me, but I feel like I’m sacrificing my entire sex life, and the last thing I want is to make him feel pressure.\nAny advice would be appreciated \n\nTL;DR: I feel sexually frustrated and unwanted because my boyfriend’s sex drive is extremely low and he won’t communicate about it.

My girlfriend told me about how her friends expressed their concern for her being \"held back\" because of me and not being able to get the full experience while she's there because we'll still be together. I completely understand where they're coming from considering we've only been official for just under two months and 'talking' since the beginning of June. My girlfriend has also expressed to me that her concern is her libido which, admittedly, is quite high.\n\nShe suggested putting our relationship on pause for a year, but I stood my ground that I wouldn't just wait for her and be no contact for a year. This is because she said that being on pause would entail still talking everyday and basically being in a relationship but not calling it one for the sake of having physical connections with other people and having it not being labeled cheating. We've talked about opening the relationship up under the conditions that she tells me and checks if I'm okay with it, she discloses it with any partner she has, she only does engage in physical intimacy with the same person as a one night stand with no possibilities for reaching out, and she only does so when she is at the extreme breaking point of sexual needs. I just don't know if that's the right choice but it was the only thing I could do to not break up immediately. We've already clarified that it's not some excuse to just cheat on me but it's purely for sexual needs.\n\nI'm not going to engage in any sexual activity because I'm the type of person where strings are attached to it and my libido is also way lower than hers but I'm not going to ask her to abstain for a year. We still love each other and can very easily picture a long term relationship together but I don't know if I've got rose coloured glasses on and I'm just terrified of losing her so I'm willing to do anything or if this is actually a the best option for us.\n\nPlease help if you can, I've been crying my eyes out since last night.

He’s very successful, and financially well-off, while I’m about to turn 25 and start my own career. From the very beginning, he’s been incredibly attentive — constant calls and texts, thoughtful little gifts and snacks, virtual movie nights, and sweet compliments. He calls me his queen, tells me I’m everything to him, and I genuinely feel cared for and happy.\n\nThat said, there are a few things I’d like some perspective on:\n\n•The speed of the relationship: He told me he loves me about 2 months in. He’s already talking about marriage and children and is planning to fly to my country soon to meet my parents and formally ask their permission.\n\n•His sexual openness: He sometimes asks me for pictures, and when I send him regular outfit selfies, he’ll tell me he masturbated to them. I don’t know if this is common behavior for men or if it’s too much too soon.\n\n•His past relationships: His most recent ex is a celebrity from our home country who has publicly shared that she was raped by another rapper before she dated him. Our country unfortunately has a high HIV/AIDS rate, which has made me a bit anxious about sexual health in general. I’d like to ask him to get tested before we become physical, but I’m nervous about how to bring it up respectfully.\n\n•Dating history & preferences: He avoids the subject when I ask how many women he’s been with, which makes me think it might be a lot. He’s mentioned he usually prefers curvier women, and all of his exes look nothing like me — I’m quite slim. He’s also made comments about younger women being “better” and said he’s always wanted a “trophy wife.”\n\n•Appearance-related comments: I have light brown hair that can look golden in the sun, but he insists I’m blonde and says he’s always wanted a blonde wife. I know he means it as a compliment, but it sometimes makes me feel like I don’t measure up to this ideal image he has in his head.\n\nOverall, he treats me very well, and I do feel happy with him — but I also want to make sure I’m not getting swept up in something that’s moving too quickly.\n\nQuestions I’d love advice on:\n\nIs this kind of intensity normal in new, long-distance relationships, or does it sound like love bombing?\n\nHow can I bring up the topic of sexual health and testing without making it uncomfortable?\n\nHow do I know if I should slow things down, and what’s a healthy pace for a relationship like this?\n\nAre his comments about younger women, curvier women, and “trophy wives” harmless preferences, or should I be concerned about how he views women?\n\nHow do I keep my insecurities in check when he compares me (even indirectly) to his ideal “type”?\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts and any practical advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Earlier this year (around Feb–July), our relationship was really rocky. We were constantly fighting, and we even took several “breaks.” During those breaks, he mostly played video games and spent money on in-game stuff, while I kept trying to express my feelings. The frustrating part is that he’d sometimes listen once, but then go back to old habits, which made me feel like he never really tried for our relationship.\n\nAnother issue is that he often says one thing, but the reality is something else. For example, he’ll say “A,” but then it turns out to be “B.” When I confront him, he either says he “forgot” or claims he was just saying things randomly. This has made it really hard for me to trust him, because I never know if he’s being genuine.\n\nBy June, we decided to take a month-long break. At the end of July, we got back together and things were okay… for a week. Then I found out he had subscribed to OnlyFans during the months we were fighting. He knows how I feel about porn/OF. I’ve told him I don’t see the point when he already has a partner in real life. Pornhub I might still understand, but paying for OF feels more extreme and disrespectful to me. It made me feel like I had no dignity as his girlfriend. Because this happened during our fighting moments, I forgave him. And since then he stopped watching.\n\nOn top of that, I have weird feelings about his relationship with his mom. I know every family shows affection differently, and his dad passed away, so maybe that explains part of it. But he still hugs her a lot, cuddles her, pecks her neck, and sometimes even compares me to her (like saying my hair smells like hers). When she visited our country, he held her hand and left me walking behind them, which felt strange. I’m torn between feeling sympathy for her (since she’s a widow and very attached to her youngest son) and feeling uneasy because I worry he won’t prioritize me in the future.\n\nFor context: I come from a loving family too, but our way of showing affection has clear boundaries. We don’t cuddle or kiss, but we’re very close in a healthy way.\n\nThat being said, I’m not saying he’s the world’s worst boyfriend. Whenever he visits me, he pays for meals, groceries, and sometimes even my shopping. He often helps me with chores like laundry, dishes, and cleaning my room. He also makes the effort to visit me despite us being semi–long distance (it’s a 2–3 hour bus ride, and he usually comes twice a month). He even kept visiting during our constant fighting phase.\n\nPlease keep in mind that every single issue I’ve mentioned here, I have already addressed with him directly. He always says “okay” but his actions don’t always follow. Recently, his mom has been texting him a lot, but he’s been responding very slowly because from what I’ve seen he’s been trying to spending all his free time with me.\n\nAt this point, I’m stuck because I don’t know if this relationship is actually healthy or if I’m just forcing something that isn’t working. How do I know when it’s worth continuing to try, versus when it’s better to walk away?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Looking for advice regarding US health insurance, travel insurance, and hospital bills. What can we do?\n\nHi guys, this is our first time posting looking for advice. To be honest, it’s kind of a hail Mary. But we're really needing/hoping we could receive some guidance on what to do with my current situation. Apologies in advance for any reddit mistakes and thank you for your patience.\n\nTLDR; My (29M, US citizen) fiancée (30F, Brazilian) is visiting for a couple months on a tourist visa while we wait for her K1-Fiancée visa to be approved. Six days into visiting she was in a grease fire accident which resulted in 3rd degree burns to all of her right arm and hand from the bicep down, her right thigh and the majority of her left leg and foot. She’s now out of the hospital and recovering. Her travel insurance medical expenses are capped out at $150,000 and they said they are not negotiating prices with the hospital, leaving us with potentially over $112,000 in medical debt unless something can be done to help reduce it. This whole thing has been devastating and a nightmare. We've been in an LDR for almost 6 years, and right before we’re finally starting our life together, this happens. Any advice, tips or tricks to navigating this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA little background on us and the circumstances around her visiting the US. My fiancée and I have been in a long-distance relationship for 6 years come October. We are currently going through the K1-Fiancée visa process and are approaching the final stages, where she will be required to visit the U.S. embassy in Brazil to finish the process.  Back in July, she was amicably released from my full-time job in Brazil. She was given advance notice of her last day, so we decided she should travel to the US for a few months on her tourist visa while we wait. The logic was if she have nothing to do because she’s unemployed, she might as well be here with me during it and help set up the apartment for her permanent arrival.\n\nShe arrived on August 4th and everything was going great. Then on August 9th, while I was away at work she was trying to cook lunch for me. She was doing a deep fry recipe, but it was her first (and last) time ever deep frying anything (her words). The oil started smoking and then caught on fire. She wasn't sure what to do when the flames started to reach the wooden cabinets above the stove, so she tried and move the oil outside onto my apartment’s balcony. While moving the pan a little bit splashed on her hand, resulting in dropping it. The oil spilled onto her right arm/hand, right thigh and close to the entire lower left leg and foot. Thankfully as soon as the oil hit the carpet, the fire went out immediately and no further damage happened, and our dog was completely unharmed. She knocked door to door looking for help and eventually was saved by my downstairs 80yo neighbor, who called me while she got into the shower to manage the pain. \n\nWhen I arrived, I rushed her to the closest emergency room. She was stabilized until she could be transferred to another hospital with a full body burn unit. The only one in the state. She was treated very well by the staff there. Nurses, doctors, therapists, everyone. They communicated great and really helped to keep us as comfortable and at peace as possible. In her words, the only bad part of the stay was the food, but that could be expected, I think. Monday, August 11th was her first procedure to have the dead and damaged skin removed from her arm removed to see if she needed grafts. The doctors ultimately determined grafts would be necessary to all her burns with exception of some small spots from oil splashing on her legs. They started with a \"fake skin\" graft (Allograft) on her arm, and a deep clean of all her wounds. After the procedure, it was the worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Replacing the initial burns as her new 10/10 on the pain scale.\n\nHer second procedure was on August 15th. She had the fake skin removed from her arm, dead tissue removed from her legs, everything deep cleaned again then finally the skin grafts were stapled, with skin being taken from good spots of her thighs and calves. The day after that procedure was the new worst pain she'd ever experienced in her life. Then they didn't touch any of her wounds for daily cleaning or anything for 4 days. On the 19th, she had all her staples that were holding the grafts in place removed and got her wound care/cleaning (not a deep clean) again. The skin grafts looked pretty cool to be honest. Her arm looked like it was covered in dragon scales. After another 4 days of intense PT exercises and healing, plus some sessions with her PT coach (that I nicknamed Ms. Sunshine) she was doing well enough to go home by August 24th. \n\nNow, thankfully she was fortunate enough to have very good travel insurance through her MasterCard that paid for the trip. It covered up to $150,000 in her medical expenses. By the way, interesting fact, medical expenses covered by travel insurance does NOT count as health insurance. Which was a pain in the ass because we had been dealing with the contracted health insurance company \"AXA\", who struggled to communicate with us and especially the hospital. Adding to all the hassle and confusion and smoke (pun intended), we were struggling/unable to get a solid answer on what they (AXA) were covering, which was very worrisome. When you've been in a state-of-the-art burn unit for 15 days and simply existing in the room cost us over $11,000 a day, she capped out on the $150,000 quickly. IF her insurance actually covers their share and doesn’t weasel out on anything, then the additional costs are one of our last a major issues. \n\nWe still haven't gotten the bill, but we got an estimate with detailed items of $224,400.18 that included medicine, wound care, procedures and the room rate. We were keeping track of that bill almost twice a week but after she was discharged our new estimate also had specific charges for every doctor stacked on. Resulting in a surprise extra sum of $38,553.14. Making the new total expenses $262,953.32 (which is a terrifying prospect). After looking at all the itemized expenses, the only thing that stood out for us (besides the surprise extra charges) was that there was no change in the room price (over $11k) even after we got moved to a different floor, unit, in a room less than half the size and with far less active nursing. \n\nNow, my fiancée and I have decent savings accounts that could help some. But nothing that could cover this potential additional $112,000 in debt. Our savings accounts were supposed to be to help us start a life together, not... this. Aside from the medical expenses her travel insurance covered for her mom to travel here to help take care of her, which has been a huge blessing to both of us. The insurance is also offering to cover both her and her mom’s flights back home to Brazil once she’s recovered enough to deal with airport germs. We simply are overwhelmed and don't know what to do about all this, and we hardly know anything about hospital bills, negotiations or dealing with insurance companies. Plus, the hospital keeps giving us the run around on who to talk to regarding billing or negotiations.\n\nThere's also been a lot of other surprise expenses, all hitting at the exact same time as this accident. It's made our finances even more tight and stressful. This is just overall so difficult to deal with on so many levels, especially when you have no idea the scope of the systems you're dealing with. It's just been a nightmare from start to finish, and it's not even done yet. Please give us an outside view looking in. We're trying to remain calm, but the looming debt gets closer every day. Any relevant experiences, tips, tricks, or advice; it's all welcome. We will also try to answer any questions that are asked. What can we do?\n\nThanks guys, \n\nT & M", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I was asking questions and after some time she said that she lied. After that, I broke up with her because of trust issues.\n\nShe texted me after a while, had a big apology and we started over.\n\nAfter some months she broke up with me again because she went to college, and she said “long distance doesn't work out for me” and I heard from her myself that she went regularly clubbing getting drunk there went on a date even.\n\nShe said she hasn't been with anyone. After that she begged me to come back non-stop for almost half a year, and now I'm back with her, but the issue is I can't trust her.

I'm honestly a good-looking dude, and she says u can't wear compression shirts because its too revealing. And I said “ok u can wear everything u like except this piece because it's a bit TOO much IMO”, but today she wears it and said ups sorry forgot.\n\nShe had summer holidays and since she is back at college she texts me at 12am at night stays for 5 minutes and lefts. i know she is a social person but just write me 5 minutes daily and go to bed really? She follows dudes, but she always asks about the girls who i follow. Then she resists me to unfollow them but when i ask about the dude she is following (after she asks ofc) she just says they are just dudes from the college i talk about exams.\n\nI don't want to lose her because i love her and i don't want her to be with another man but i can't stand it anymore.

He came back on Sunday to tell me, and let me know he'd really like to make long distance work but understood if I didn't want to commit to it. I obviously was not happy about it, but it took me no time to agree that we had to at least try. We love each other so much, and both of us know that we want to be together for a long time.

Some of which we even dance with in our couple’s dance lessons.\n\nOne invited him to a bar when we were dating. He asked me if it was ok (without mentioning their past). I wanted to be the ‘cool girlfriend’ and said yes.  I’d always felt iffy about her and noticed he was nervous, but I wanted give him the benefit of the doubt and be the ‘cool girlfriend’. \n\nLater she made rude comments about our relationship, and I found out he had tried to date her (and others). He did not tell these women that we were in a relationship (until the women asked directly, way into our relationship) and he would simply reply “yes”.\n\nHis explanation was that the communication was friendly and that he is private about things he cares about (me). I told him he also has to consider what he signals to others and to me. He said I should only care about how he feels for me.\n\nSome were audio calls, some audio messages, some texts. Some were only one date, some months of dating, some years of marriage.\nI have only seen a handful of texts. And I keep thinking there’s more that I don’t know about. \n\nHe admits that he should’ve been more transparent and that he was selfish because he had had a principle about not wanting a partner to control his friendships in any way. He says he now understands that he needs to take the other person into consideration.\n\nStill, I found out about another woman he’d sent audio messages with for months. He had stopped replying some months before our talk, but he only admitted after I’d asked 10 times that he’d asked her to be in a relationship with him (after knowing her one day). I have not heard the messages. I wish I had. I wish I could look through all his messages with these women to see what they’ve been talking about while he was with me. \n\nAt a recent wedding, he got seemingly excited about another woman being there and stood up to call her, but then changed his mind, sat down, and told me it was nothing anyway. Later, I saw old messages between them. He had sent a video of them dancing the first day the met and later, he told her that their “conversation was still in his heart”. He says it the topic was about a job change, but the wording sounded so intimate to me. This was before our relationship, to be fair. \nTwo days after the wedding, she texted him to catch up and he showed me the message (on his own). He told me there had never been anything between them, though. \nWhen I asked him to mention that he has a girlfriend, she replied, “I am happy for both of you”. I may be influenced by the insecurity now, but I would only say “I am happy for the both of you” to someone I had had feelings for to signal that I was not a threat. But maybe that’s just me. \n\nI don’t feel he protects our relationship or gives me the maturity I need. We tried couple’s therapy, but he felt attacked. I’ve started individual therapy to understand whether I’m too insecure or if it’s his actions, but my therapist tends to validate my feelings.\nI have reached the point where I see every woman as a threat. I know his type by now (or I imagine that I know) and just a look at or ‘friendly’ dance with such a woman makes me feel nervous now. \n\nOne message keeps replaying: the ‘iffy’ girl he’d  dated just before me called me a “carnival queen” because of my glittery dress and asked if it had anything to do with him (being from Brazil). He ignored that and answered that next time he’ll go to a costume party, it will be a 80’s party and she replied “can’t wait to see your hair”. \nI was not wearing a custome. And we were gonna go to that aforementioned costume party together. I felt like at her part was subtle flirting. And I felt that my boyfriend was mocking me. \nI am now trying to sell that dress because it makes me embarrassed to even see it. That’s why I got sad today and made this post. \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my situation?\n\nAnd the “what if it was the other way around” doesn’t work. He doesn’t get jealous or insecure. \nWhen people describe us from the outside, they say he seems care very much for me and always show PDA. I think it would help to have an open phone policy. He just gets annoyed and upset when I ask for it which doesn’t support me in my healing. He thinks that we should we past this, by now.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend kept secretly in touch with exes/women he’s dated, downplays it as “friendly. Has stopped the behaviour now but thinks I should be over it by now. Doesn’t think that letting me see his phone until I gain trust or assure me when I get insecure is the answer. \nI’ve lost trust, feel mocked by his interactions, and don’t know if the issue is me or him.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Advice?\n\nI (F28] and my husband [M28] have been together for about 6 years. But I feel that me moving from Australia to America was the biggest mistake of my life. It’s only just hitting me that although I love him with all my heart, I don’t see myself living here for the rest of my life. We are Christian and don’t believe in divorce - so I don’t want this to be the end. But I also feel like I am kidding myself. \n\nI did every step to ensure that I would be here. I got my immigration papers done and now I am waiting on a Green Card. I’m not able to get a job legally because they still haven’t approved my Employment paperwork. I can’t visit my family yet as they haven’t approved of that particular paperwork either, and I’ve been told if I leave the country without permission from USCIS they will reject my application for a Green Card. \n\nI used to work everyday in Australia, now I have to be at home all the time and do nothing. I hate my life. I’ve always imagined myself working part/full time and also being a wife that does the majority of the house work because I liked the traditional mindset. I hate that I now have to rely on my husband financially for everything. I’ve told this to my husband and he says that I should wait longer rather than leave the marriage, so that I can at least see how it would be if I get a job. \n\nBut I feel everyday that I live is just utter hell. I had hobbies, I don’t have any now other than playing video games. I play them all the time and I feel that I’m not doing anything to progress myself as a person. We live in a crappy neighbourhood where it’s not a good idea for me to be outside, so I literally spend all my days inside the house. I’ve contemplated killing myself many times and I miss my old life. But if I had to have that old life back, it would mean without him. This is my first marriage and I don’t want to give up so easily, but I feel my head is so screwed up that I don’t want to wait patiently anymore. I’m so sad that I can’t do anything. I can’t drive anywhere either - we only have one car and he takes that to work. Usually I am not up in the mornings in order to take him to work and do whatever else I want during the day as we are not financially in a good place so I can’t spend any money even if I wanted to. \n\nThe only thing I look forward to everyday is seeing my husband come home.

My friends. \n\nI’ve been given advice that while I am here, I might as well wait a couple of years since I’ve always wanted the opportunity to work in America.

I (26M) and my girlfriend (27F) haven't had a real conversation for almost a month, and it's incredibly frustrating. For context: my girlfriend and I have been together for only a couple of months. She's really big on communication, which we both agree is needed for a healthy relationship, and going into it, we both knew that even though our communication was pretty good, we still needed to work on it, and we did, and our communication has drastically improved. Also, my girlfriend has bipolar 1 disorder, which will become important later.\n\n\nBack on August 23rd I texted her to see how she was doing, as she hadn't responded for a couple of days. She apologized and said she felt distant lately and was going through things. I assured her that there was no need to apologize and if she needs to talk to someone, that I will be there. She thanked me, and we didn't discuss it further. I gave her some space and texted her on her birthday, and she didn't reply at all. That was fine; I assumed she was celebrating and didn't really give it much thought. Another week passes, and I check in to see how she's doing and catch up a bit. She responded, texted me three times, and then went radio silent again. This would happen the next two times she actually responded to my texts, including a couple of days ago.\n\n\nNow the reason that her having bipolar 1 was important is that she could be going through a manic low, and it's really kicking her ass. Unfortunately, we live 1,300 miles apart (we both live in the US), and because of my work schedule, I can't fly out and see how she's doing, and she's the only person I can ask how she's doing, as I'm not connected to anyone else in her life. Her lack of responses is getting frustrating, and I feel guilty for being frustrated because of what she might be dealing with. However, I have dealt with her in a manic low before, and it only lasted a couple of days, and then she was back to her normal self.\n\n\nMy question is, should I bring this up to her and how, or should I wait and hope the whole situation resolves itself?

Her “cousin” [21M] moved in after she said he was just visiting.\n\nMy girlfriend (18F) and I (23M) have been dating a little over a month. We’re in a long-distance relationship I live in Indiana, she lives in Missouri. We FaceTime almost every night.\n\nBackground:\nI’ve known her mom since I was about 14, and our families became close family friends. I only met her daughter (my girlfriend) this year, and that’s when we started dating.\n\nShe told me her cousin (21M) would be visiting, but the day he arrived, she said he was actually moving in with her and her mom. Before he arrived, she even encouraged me to come visit before he showed up. Since then, she and her cousin have been hanging out often playing Fortnite and watching movies together.\n\nHere’s what’s confusing: I don’t even know if he’s her real cousin. He calls her mom “aunt” the same way me and my siblings always did when our families hung out, so it makes me wonder if he’s just a long-time family friend like me.\n\nWhat happened last night:\nOn FaceTime I noticed a box of Seagram’s. She told me she wasn’t drinking because her stomach hurt and only her cousin would be drinking. — Later in the night, I woke up early and saw her muted. While muted, I saw her take a drink. — When I asked in the morning if she drank, she said no. — After pressing her, she admitted she lied, apologized, and said she didn’t know why — only that she was tired from being up late. — On top of that, I got two different reasons for why she muted: first, because she was being loud while gaming, then later, because she went to the bathroom.\n\nWhy I’m uneasy:\nEach thing on its own may not seem huge. But when you add it up — her cousin suddenly moving in, her pushing me to visit before he arrived, them hanging out a lot, the lie about drinking, and the conflicting stories about muting — my gut has been telling me something isn’t right.\n\nWhat I need advice on (from people who understand LDR struggles):\nHow do I bring this up calmly without it sounding like I’m accusing her? — What boundaries make sense in long-distance relationships (honesty about small things, not muting without explanation, being upfront about living situation changes)? — Should I bring this up over the phone before I see her Saturday, or wait until we’re face-to-face?\n\nTL;DR:\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend (18F) for just over a month (I’m 23M). She said her cousin (21M) was just visiting, but the day he came she said he was moving in. They hang out a lot. Last night she lied about drinking when I saw her drink on FaceTime, gave two reasons for muting, and only admitted to lying after I pressed her. I don’t even know if he’s her real cousin or just a family friend.

She told me everything about this guy as she never hides anything from me. She told me that this guy is really sweet, talks so decently and is really well-mannered. I was like ok, if anyone is behaving nice with her i dont have any problem with that.

My innocent girlfriend got really impressed with his way approaching her and now she is asking me why i am not as decent as him, and telling me  \"it's been 4 years of LDR, you have only given me emotional support but not physical support, you stay so far from me and I am starting to realize I am missing out on so many things in life.\" I told her not to talk to him as he is trying to take her away from me, but she says we are only close friends. I ask her what is the need to have a male friend when I am there for her. I tell her how can you forget all the happy moments we spent together and dreams of marriage we saw together because of some random guy. She says she doesn't know.  \n\n\nThen we had series of fights in call and lots crying and shouting throughout the week. She says that due to long distance she gets attracted to others but she loves me. I said \"that's not how a relationship works, I am working hard to be together forever but you are looking somewhere else.\" She had exams throughout the week so I wasn't disturbing her and after exams she told me that she was talking to guy and crying that how insensitive i am towards this relationship and that broke my cool and we started fighting.

I had apologized her for that mistake from my own side right on that date, but now she is bringing that up now to show that she is the only one waiting for me to be together, and she has been giving me too many chances and she has lost all her patience to wait for me anymore. Her mom, who loved me a lot for being her boyfriend, she even invited me to my GF's birthday party few months ago, is now telling her that i am not a good guy for her. It breaks my heart to see my girl broke the only policy we once made that whatever conflict or fight happens we will fix it together and not let a 3rd person judge us.\n\nI don't want to talk with her as she has been becoming too close with that guy. We are slowly moving towards a breakup and I can clearly see it. I asked her to talk to me after a week to cool ourselves up.\n\nI love my girlfriend so much and seeing her acting cold and rude is breaking my heart.

We’ve been married for 1 year, together for 4 years. He is very angry, and I feel depleted and numb.\n\nBackstory: \nMy husband suffers from a type of OCD called Relationship OCD otherwise known as Retroactive Jealousy. It is where he fixates on my past sexual relationships, particularly on one person, a person who I have not even spoken to in over 8 years. \n\nHe can get triggered anytime, anywhere. We could be watching TV and a character will have the same name and he will get triggered. Last weekend, we were at a concert celebrating our one year wedding anniversary and someone came on stage wearing a jersey that is for the same sport this person used to play. He wanted to leave the concert immediately, we ended up fighting and our anniversary was ruined. \n\nAnytime he is triggered, his energy completely shifts from warm, goofy and loving to ice cold and bothered and he shuts me out. It is a very sad, confusing, frustrating and isolating experience for me and for him, it’s mental turmoil.\n\nPretty much every single fight we have had in our relationship has stemmed from his retroactive jealousy. Other than that, we’ve been extremely happy. Unfortunately, every time he gets triggered it chips away at my happiness. I walk on eggshells and feel anxiety sometimes because I never know when he will get triggered next.\n\nI thought he might get better with time / after marriage because he would finally see that I want him and only him forever, I was wrong. \n\nEver since he was triggered on our anniversary last weekend and we fought, things have never been worse. Something feels different about this time, like I finally realized this isn’t going away or I’ve hit my breaking point. We’ve been cordial to each other all week and sleeping in the same bed but no sex.\n\nYesterday, he asked me if “I’m ready to go back to being loving again”. I told him my concerns and how he needs to seek support / medication for this RJ. I also thanked him for giving me space (which literally just meant not initiating sex) and he got an attitude and say “yea well I was upset too”. \n\nIt felt clear to me in this moment that he wasn’t really listening to me and to be fair, I sometimes have a difficult time seeing things from his side as well. Sometimes his aggressive approach and victim mindset in conversation makes me automatically defensive. \n\nHe ended up storming out of the room and slept in the guest room (where he always sleeps when he’s upset or for his everyday naps) and has been slamming every door he walks through ever since. \n\nAt this point, there is so much tension that I told him I will move his things from the master bedroom to the guest room so that we both can have space to process what we’re feeling. \n\nHe left for the day to go golfing, a new hobby he picked up that he has trashed for the last 4 years.. While he was away I moved his stuff. I did not move it to upset him, I truly feel broken and anxious when I’m around him now and just need a little space to process everything.\n\nHe came home from golf and was livid. He said he wasn’t interested in being roommates and this was no way to live. I told him once again that I need space to process everything and he said rudely “you’ve had enough space, you’ve had a week of space. Instead of moving my belongings all day you could have instead come up with a way to communicate.” I told him I did try communicating with him yesterday and he got upset. I told him that the way he is currently speaking to me is with an aggressive tone to which he replied “Because I’m angry! This is ridiculous. I won’t be married to someone who can’t resolve simple issues, I won’t have kids with that person, I’m filing for divorce.” \n\nI responded that I don’t want a divorce all I am asking for is a little space for us to work through this. I don’t remember what he responded but he didn’t care that I said that and I think again he just repeated he was filing for divorce. \n\nAfter he said that he left the house. The crazy part is I still don’t feel much? I don’t feel angry or sad, just numb. Perhaps I’m over it or it could be some kind of coping mechanism to protect myself.\n\nI’ve never spoken to friends or family about his RJ because I love him and didn’t want them to think negatively about him. I think it’s finally time I open up to my mother about it. I feel very alone.\n\nI’m not sure what to do or where to go from here. I’ve never been more in love with anyone in my life. He was caring, made me laugh, bought me flowers, supported me when I was laid off from my job, etc. but I am just not sure I can be in this relationship anymore now with how he’s acting. Not taking accountability, being rude to me and instead of giving me the space I need, threatening to divorce instead.\n\nREDDIT: It would help to hear from you (an outside perspective) on this. I am too in it to think clearly at the moment. Even if no one responds, it felt nice to be able to type this out. \n\nTL;DR: Husband has ROCD (retroactive jealousy) that causes most of our fights. After a bad trigger on our anniversary, he’s now threatening divorce because I asked for space, claiming I am incapable of solving issues. I feel numb and don’t know if this relationship is salvageable.\n\n____________________\n\nUPDATE: I am blown away at the amount of support this post has gotten. Thank you to everyone who has responded and to the mod of this post for giving me a great book recommendation. As many of you guessed, his threat of divorce was not real.\n\nFor the first time in 4 years I truly put my foot down and told my husband that I will no longer put up with this treatment. I told him that if he continues to choose not to seek help and instead continue to hurt me, then I’m not staying (and he knows I mean it). I told him I love him, but I love me and my mental health more. \n\nSince this long conversation he has set up an immediate plan:\n\nDaily plan: \n* Morning reflection / meditation\n* Medicine / Vitamins: Fluoxetine, magnesium, omega 3\n* Workout\n\nWeekly plan:\n* Meet with therapist / start ERP (first session is scheduled for this weekend)\n* Read 50 pages of self help books: \n    * The Art of Letting Go - read by 10/1\n    * The Happiness Trap - read by 10/1\n    * Overcoming Retroactive Jealousy - read by 10/15\n    * Brain Lock: Overcoming OCD -  read by 10/30 \n\nI told him that I support him, but that he needs to do deep reflection and work on himself before we can start rebuilding our relationship. I plan on leaving town this week to spend some time with my mother and will be working on an exit plan to have just in case the day comes. \n\nI have found a lot of strength and growth within myself throughout this process,  and am very proud of myself. \n\nI can’t describe how it felt going from feeling so isolated and alone to feeling like I have a community who supports me through this post.

My boyfriend (30M) is from Peru and I (31F) am from Brazil. We’re in a long-distance relationship, but we spend a lot of time together online, playing games, and in long videocalls talking and spending good time together. Usually, we joke around a lot—it’s part of our dynamic and normally it’s lighthearted and fun.\n\nThe situation: today we were playing an online game with his little sister. We often tease each other and he tease his sister a lottttt, and he himself constantly calls us things like, “You’re so bad, you can’t play at all, I have to do everything.” It doesn’t bother me. it's true that sometimes I play well and sometimes I don’t, and I just laugh it off.\n\nThis time, though, I said, “Don’t worry, I’m going to carry the game,” but he misheard it as, “What? You’re going to ruin the game?” (in Spanish *cargar* = to carry, and *cagar* = to mess up). I usually laugh these things off, but I was a little annoyed because he had already been making comment after comment. Still, it wasn’t a big deal, it’s just a game. I corrected the word he used and called him “idiot,” but I said it in a joking tone.\n\nHe got really upset, stopped smiling, and after his sister left the room, he told me, “I don’t mind harsh jokes, but I didn’t expect that from you. To me, your tone wasn’t playful—it sounded like something that slipped out.” I was confused and said, “Why would I call you ‘idiot’ seriously and not as a joke?” He explained that sometimes when people are angry, they say things they don’t mean even to the parents and then regret it later.\n\nHere’s the part that’s hard for me: to me, when something “slips out,” it usually means it’s what you *really* think of the person, which wasn’t the case at all. But now he’s saying he feels like I’m not being honest with him, that maybe I hide things or lie. He even asked me if I’ve ever lied to him about anything—which I haven’t. I’ve always been completely transparent with him in every way, no matter how embarrassing or intimate.\n\nThe thing is, he’s very insecure because of his past relationships—he’s been cheated on before on relationships in his city, and that left him distrustful. I try my best every day to show him I’m not like that, that he can trust me. But this situation makes me worried: how can I reassure him and clear up this misunderstanding without making him feel dismissed?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

She completed me in every way, always respected me, and I truly felt like she was made for me and I was made for her.\n\nBecause of life circumstances, we had to be in a long-distance relationship. For months she kept telling me that distance didn't matter, that I was the right person, that she wanted to marry me.\n\nBut in July she ended things because of the distance. I don't believe it was just the distance, but that was the reason she gave. Now it's September, I broke no contact and sent her a message. She takes forever to answer, just like in the beginning, before we were even together. The only difference is that back then she fell in love with me and never left me waiting again. Now, after the breakup, she does, and it hurts so much.\n\nIt hurts because the person I wanted most in this world put a final point on a story that, for me, still had so much to give and fight for. It's very hard knowing that one day someone else will receive what I received: the purest and most special love. The person who ends up with her will live the life I dreamed of having with her: getting married, having kids, and building a life together. That hurts even more.\n\nShe is a rare person in this generation. She doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke, she doesn't go to many parties, and to top it off, she was very similar to me.

But unfortunately, it ended because of things neither of us could control.

She asked how I was, I said bad, and she replied that she's fine and that she has already moved on. Later, when I asked again if she really moved on, she didn't answer directly, just said she doesn't want to talk about it so she won't hurt me. I cry every day even my mother cried with me I was diagnosed with depression and recently I'm thinking about suicide I know it's bad but it's much worse to spend a lifetime thinking \"and if it wasn't for the distance\" because I'm sure that if it weren't for the distance I would stay with her for the rest of my life and I would be the happiest person of this time and I get so bad when I think that someone will live my dream life\n\nI don't know how to deal with this.

This post is going to be extremely long, so you can go to the TLDR incase you are lacking in time.\n\nMe and my girlfriend met last year, we were friends for 2 months then we end up getting into a relationship. She had to shift somewhere else due to work while I'm completing my college. The year has been pretty toxic for me. Initially it was all fun, and everything, But as time passed, she started fighting a lot. For record, she has broke up with me multiple times and returned later drenched in guilt. Last time she broke up was 3 months ago.\n\nShe has had fight with me multiple times, I do not know how normal or abnormal is that, I just do not feel good. Fighting with her involves her making sarcastic names for me \"mr perfect\" \"robotic\" \"saint\" \"mr everything right\" \"shut up\" \"get lost\" and what not, though the fights are infrequent, like weekly or sometimes monthly, I start to resent our relationship more and more.\n\nAlso our love language do not seem to match. I am also very verbally affectionate, she tells me it becomes suffocating for her. She has used this phrase several times \"I feel claustrophobic due to your over-sweetness\". She even included good night, morning messages as a part of them for some reason.\n\nLast week we had fight and this is how it went\n\n\"She said she wants her man to be dominating, and started name-calling and stuff, my reaction is too usually shut off and tell her that I will talk later as the conversation is getting heated. She believes this is her being able to dominate me, and this is making her feel lose interest in me.\n\nWhen I tell her that her actions hurt me. She says, I have to react so strongly to her actions, that she felt compelled to change her behavior, basically she was saying that I need to fight, \"hold my ground\", argue, when she calls me name and stuff, instead of going away and coming back later, because that shows her being able to dominate me. Today I assured her that okay I will lash out and vent too if we got into a fight later on.\"\n\nHonestly I am not that socially intelligent person, hence I try to deploy my conscious thinking a lot of times in social situations, which can feel fake, manufactured, I understand. But I am just trying to improve. She tells me that I am emotionally flat, manufactures a lot of fakeness, and is non confrontational due to fear.\n\nIT has come to the point where I feel bad interacting with her.\n\nYou might think why the hell I am in such a relationship. Well because the place I live in, love marriages rarely happen, it is a third world country, second we both are non-religious, our country is heavily religious, and thirdly we both have certain issues with our parents which will prevent a huge pool of people from dating us. No contact is  a big deal, good luck finding someone like you. and I really love her when shes not being toxic.\n\nSo basically I am a weak man whos afraid of losing her. But I sincerely believe she will improve in future.\n\nI dont even know what is my question. To me it feels like she is also bored of me but sticking due to convenience reasons. It feels very toxic and suffocating.\n\n  \nHow can I proceed after this?\n\nTLDR: Constant fights, name-calling, shut-ups and what not with girlfriend. Insecure feeling when I think of leaving her. She tries to improve me according to her, I hope that she will improve in future. But we are stuck. I feel afraid of losing her even though my wants and needs are neglected constantly.

I want to say about 3 months into the school year, we met and were inseparable. I dropped out of college after the first semester, and he completed one full year and ultimately dropped out as well. He’s from the West Coast and I am from the South (where we attended college). Upon us dropping out, we made the decision to stay a couple as he moved back home to the West Coast and I stayed in my hometown. We maintained a LDR for months without seeing each other during those times.\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2023 I visited for a week and a month later, I decided to move thousands of miles away from everything I know (family, friends, etc.), to California for us to live together. I luckily had a job lined up for when I officially moved and my BF worked as well. \n\nEverything was great in the beginning, we both worked, were able to buy our dream cars, and maintain our new home. But there was no romance in my opinion. No dates, no random spontaneous surprises, nothing. Just seeing each other everyday as if we are roommates. Now…don’t get me wrong, he never fails to be affectionate and say he loves me, but I didn’t feel as if that was enough. \n\nJumping to the Spring of 2024, he started having financials issues. He could no longer afford his car, and was running behind on his half of bills. We try to split bills 50/50, and I was having to pick up the slack on rent and other bills. He decided to get rid of his car so that eliminated the car note and insurance (saving him $1400 a month) , but he still was behind. So for months, I was paying more than my normal half of the bills. Which I was okay with at the time. I took it as a bump in the road, and he would get back on his feet. But things remained the same.\n\nMoving on the Winter of 2024, I started working a bit less because I was getting burnt out. Working 12 hour shifts, 5 days a week was overwhelming for me. My BF ended up switching jobs in hopes for better pay and less hours, but it did not work out that way. He was working less hours with less pay. At this point, i’m still helping him with his bills and now i’m slowly falling behind on my own. I would hold off on paying certain things that I knew didn’t need to be paid immediately, just so we wouldn’t be late on rent or necessary utilities. This lasted until the spring of 2025.\n\n Now we arrive to the most recent time, Summer of 2025. At the beginning of the summer, he decided to quit his job to pursue trucking and get his CDL. He quit before having anything set in stone, and so it has been about 2 months of him having no job or being in trucking school.\nI have been left on my own to pay the bills, granted he does have a monthly check of $700 coming in but it barely puts a dent in our bills. He has been looking for work and has had interviews, but nothing yet. \n\nAt this point, We are behind on rent, and I am far behind on my car note and I also can’t drive my car because there is major work that needs to be done but I couldn’t afford it because all of my money was going to help him. He was able to purchase another car earlier this year that we now use as our daily driver, but of course he is behind on payments due to the circumstances. \n\nNow aside from all of that, we just celebrated our 3 year anniversary and throughout these 3 years I feel like ive been very repetitive about things that make me feel a way in our relationship. \n\n1. No Dates. Even in the beginning when we had no money issues, he would blame it on not having the money to do so. I am a pretty simple girl, it doesn’t take much to make me happy. I told him, he didn’t have to spend loads of money, even if he just planned a picnic or at home dinner date I would be ecstatic. \n\n2. I felt like he prioritized the money he did/does have for other things . Smoking, gaming, etc. \n\n3. He always says he doesn’t know how to be romantic, and i told him in this  day and age the internet is very helpful. Still nothing. Never plans anything. But can plan time with his friends…now he doesn’t go out with them often, barely at all but he puts more effort when he is planning with them. \n\n4. Before we started having financial issues, I could slowly see we were heading in that direction. I suggested to him that we should get second jobs. He was not a fan of the idea. I repeated this constantly, til the point where I was going to just get one myself but I felt like why should I have to work extra while he acts like he doesn’t have to. This leads to…\n\n5. He isn’t receptive to my suggestions. I suggested and extra job, I suggested he should have stayed at his last job until he was solidified in school, etc. But NO, he never took my advice. But whenever his mom tells him these things AFTER I have already said something he acts like its an idea he’s never heard of. I love his mom, but I just don’t appreciate the fact that it only clicks when she says something and not when I bring it up. \n\n6. He doesn’t like to help cook. He barely cleans and when he does it’s always after ive asked millions of times and he won’t do it by himself. He would wait til I got upset and started doing it myself, to start. \n\n7. While this isn’t necessarily his fault, I am extremely homesick. His family is not as big and close as mine. They don’t do family gatherings like mine or even just having family houses to go to to spend time with. I am lonely, I haven’t met any friends here. He’s the only person I technically have here, and I barely feel like I have him. \n\nI say all this to say, I talked about all these points to him about a month ago. At that point, I was ready to throw in the towel but he promised to be better and help more which he slowly has. Although now that he is, I still don’t feel happy. I feel as if he waited until he knew I was completely over it to change. Now I just feel nothing, and I dont want to be  in the wrong and breakup. We’re clearly going through something that most young adults deal with in these circumstances, but idk. I dont know if I should wait around and see if things completely change or just be done with the relationship. I don’t want to ruin something that could be good or hurt his feelings because I know he feels bad about not being able to do what he needs to.\n___\n\n**TL;DR;** :  I feel like my relationship is only a priority to my boyfriend now because I was at the edge of leaving.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

The first few months were great—we spent a lot of time together, talked a lot, even lived together briefly, and everything felt smooth. Over the last few months, though, she has become more distant and cold, while I’ve been trying to ask what’s going on. She often says my attempts to talk feel like nagging because I’m naturally social and like to talk, while she isn’t.\n\nIt seems clear the first few months may have just been the honeymoon phase. She has more relationship experience than I do, which might play a role. Last week we had our first open talk about problems, where she cried a lot and said we’re too different. From the start, I was clear about who I am and what I want, but she mostly told me how excited she was and how everything would be fine.\n\nI used to struggle with my self-image but improved my health and lifestyle, so confidence isn’t the issue now. We are also physically compatible, but I find it difficult to handle emotional distance. I see my partner as someone who should also be my closest friend, and I don’t see a future if things stay this way. At the same time, in the beginning she was very affectionate and supportive.\n\nSex was also great at the start, but for the past 3 months it’s been very rare. Around the same time, she developed a vaginal infection that she hasn’t treated despite me encouraging her to see a doctor, so that might be connected.\n\nShe often brings up past mistakes of mine repeatedly, while getting upset if I point out hers. She also asks about my history before her, even though it’s very limited, while hers is different. That creates recurring tension between us.\n\nI’ve never been the one to end a relationship before—I usually just distance myself until things fall apart. But this time I feel I need clarity and resolution. I don’t want to be the only one putting in effort.\n\nI’m going home in 2 days and need to resolve this before then, since I’ll have important commitments afterward and don’t want this hanging over me. It feels like the relationship no longer has a future, and if it ends, I need to approach it directly instead of letting things drag out.\n\nTL;DR: Together 7 months, first few were great, but for the last 3 she’s been distant and cold, sex almost gone, constant tension, and conversations go nowhere.

But lately I’ve been scared she's a conservative, and honestly it’s eating me alive. I’ve always been clear that I don’t want to be close with people who hold those kinds of views, because our morals and values are VERY different. The idea that she, of all people, might secretly hold them would literally break me.\n\nIt started after she went through a big life event and suddenly became very Christian. Since then, I’ve noticed little things:\n\nI told her about how some guy at a party asked me to go upstairs like 2 minutes after meeting me, and I was telling her how disgusted I was. She responded with “well, you shouldn’t have put yourself in a situation like that if you didn’t want something to happen.” That gave me big “if you didn’t want to get assaulted, why did you wear that?” vibes.\n\nAnother time, when I was scared I might have been pregnant, she said “well, if people don’t want to get pregnant they shouldn’t have sex.” It came off very judgmental and prudish.\n\nWhenever I make comments like “oh I don’t wanna be around xyz cause they’re MAGA/conservative/Republican,” she goes silent. No reaction.\n\nWe were talking about dating (we both see the same tarot reader, and she told her she’d end up with someone with different views). I mentioned, “what if he’s conservative/MAGA/Republican?” and she goes “you know I’m an independent, right?” (which… that’s what they all say when they’re hiding it). Barely reacted. But when I pushed it and said “what if he’s a neo-Nazi?” she immediately said “omg well my dad’s Jewish.” That difference in reaction felt like a huge red flag.\n\nPlsu, after Charlie Kirk passed, I mentioned how I got shamed for not feeling bad (like, I don’t think he deserved to die, but I’m not gonna mourn someone who spread so much hate). And once again… crickets from her.\n\n\nAll these little things keep piling up. And now I can’t stop worrying that she’s actually conservative/MAGA/ replublican and just doesn’t want to admit it.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with a friend suddenly shifting like this? Do I bring it up, or just wait and see? I’m torn because this is my literal best friend since forever, but the anxiety of her secretly being one of them is eating me alive.\n\n\nTLDR: My lifelong best friend recently became very religious (yk a lot of the time, that's where it starts) , and I’m noticing subtle comments and silence that make me fear she’s conservative/Republican. I don’t want to be close to people with those values, but she’s my ride-or-die.

We have a long history of talking and not talking. We had never actually dated until now, but there have been strong feelings, albeit mixed at times, for over a year. We reconnected and started talking again this year. We are both seniors in college but attend different schools, so after we reconnected in person, we went long distance.\n\nAt the start of our talking stage, she told me that she was also talking to somebody else. It bothered me a little, but I decided to keep talking to her since it was early, and we weren’t officially dating. She’s perfectly entitled to act as she likes. In the past, whenever we were talking, it had been all or nothing, and this time was no different. We were FaceTiming every night for hours, constantly texting. She’s someone I really click with.\n\nShe would still see this other guy here and there, and I wasn’t happy about it but tried not to bring it up. Neither of us were ready to start a long-distance relationship, especially given our history and the trust that had been broken in the past. This went on until I invited her to my frat formal in April. We spent the weekend together, and it was magical. We had such a good time together; it felt like we were constantly laughing and talking. I’ve never felt so close to anyone. She told me that she loved me, and I told her the same.\n\nWhen we were out at the bars the last night, she told me that she had hooked up with the other guy and wanted to be honest with me about it. I wasn’t happy, but I was drunk, so I kind of forgot about it. Before I took her to the airport, we had a long talk about what we thought about us going forward. She said she wanted to keep talking but didn’t want to start dating until the summer because she didn’t want to start a relationship while it was long distance (we would be in the same city over summer break). I was ready to start dating her, but after hearing what she said, I didn’t really speak up. I told her that I “didn’t like her seeing that other guy,” and she said she would end it “soon.” She was coming up again in a month, and she said it would be before then.\n\nOver that month, she hung out with him two more times, but then she told me she ended it. She also went on a first date, which she now tells me was just “for fun” and a last first date before dating me. She made out with the guy (she told me, saying that she wanted to always be honest with me).\n\nWhen she came back to the city, we again had a great time, but she got really drunk one night, and I had to take her to the hospital. The next morning, she told me that she was so thankful I took care of her and that she was ready to date me because I really am a great guy, going back on her claim to wait until summer. I went down to her city after the weekend and asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes.\n\nThe next day, she told me two things: that she was blacked out and kissed the guy the day before she came back to my city, and that she “wasn’t always going to choose me.” She said that before we went on the first trip together, she thought she was going to choose the other guy, but as the trip approached, he stopped putting in as much effort. After the trip, she said she had decided on me.\n\nI don’t know, that stung because, in my mind, I felt like she was saying I was the second option and that we’re only dating now because this other guy dropped the ball. That remark and her hooking up with other people for a long time after we started talking, along with her going on that first date after telling me she loved me, still stick in my head after 5 months of dating. I know that we weren’t dating, and she was well within her rights to do whatever she wanted, but it still bothers me. Since we started our relationship, she has been phenomenal—she hasn’t talked to the other guy, given me no reason not to trust her, and has been super caring and loving. That makes it worse when I get these intrusive thoughts about the past and feel upset with her.\n\nI don’t know, am I being crazy? I would love some outside opinions. My thoughts are that I should’ve definitely set more clear boundaries and told her that I wanted to start dating after she came up to see me the first time. I didn’t, and now here we are. Honestly, the things that stick in my head the most are her going on that first date and her telling me that she wasn’t planning on choosing me. I just wish she hadn’t told me all of that stuff. I understand her wanting to be honest with me, but I also feel like the things she did while we were just talking are none of my business, to be honest.

We met at work in the US this past summer and hit it off immediately. Now I am in my first year of college in Connecticut while she is in her last year of college (high school) in Ireland. On Monday (2 days ago) we talked where we both agreed it would be a good idea to take a break from each other for a bit, more for her sake. While we are very close to each other we never formally agreed or committed to a relationship with one another. When we talked on Monday she mentioned she felt guilty about not committing to a relationship with me as she felt she couldn’t given her circumstances. For context the last year of college in Ireland is incredibly stressful as she’s applying for college in the U.S. and Uni in the UK. So there’s a lot of tests and studying and essays and things like that. Two weeks ago we had a similar talk to what we had on Monday where she said she was thinking of taking a break or slowing down our communication. We talked everyday, and called pretty much every night before she went to bed. We haven’t talked at all over the last couple days, and I’ve been thinking about her constantly.

I want to make things better and express to him how much he means to me but i don’t know how to. \n\nSo, to begin with, we are in LDR right now and we started LDR like two years ago. I cheated on him after 4 months of LDR. It will soon be a year after we reconnected. Before LDR we had this wonderful relationship that i ruined after doing it and i regret it every single day. Even when i was doing it with the other guy i was like a dead body just doing it because i did it the first time. That guy told me to do it only one time and get back to him. I didn’t. Because i won’t be able to look at him in his face like i used to before and hide the truth neither do i have the courage to tell him the truth. Even so, i continued doing it. Writing this makes me disgust at myself. How could i? \n\nThe first time i did it - let me tell you the story. We were in rough phase of our relationship. We used to fight because i started college and he was in a job where he has ample of time and my college was 7 to 9. 14 hours long. So i don’t had the time. To keep my mind sane from all the college stuff i spend time with my friends at a cafe and when i tell him this he used to be like you have time for friends and not me. The kind of things we talk about in the 15-20 minutes were also not quite like real talking as i was drained. Idk now i always put myself first. Maybe that was the reason of all that. But i was too tired to talk. Didn’t know what to do back then. After all this i met a guy who i used to consider as my big brother since he looked really and acted like my brother. But yeah long story short during that rough phase he flirted - i didn’t stopped him - had no limit/boundaries - he asked me to come to hotel - we did it. I was in complete auto pilot mode. Never even given once a thought about my partner. To make things worse i continued doing it from jan to aug last year. Complete 8 months.\n\nI broke off my on and off relationship in march without telling him the reason. Even when he insisted i tell him different reasons every time. My purpose was just to make my image bad in his mind since that would be easy for him to move on from me. Even after breaking up we used to talk on and off through text and calls since we both miss each other. I used to act cold since i didn’t want him to think of me as a nice person. I wanted him to curse me and move on from me. But how could he? He didn’t even had one proper reason. He loved me. I loved him every day, then, now and always. Even if we go separate ways. And i will regret everything i did and i don’t think i will ever move on since the thing i did is now a part of me that i will never forget. I can never forgive myself for my sins, even if he did.\n\nMy condition was getting worse so i blocked that person from everywhere who i was cheating with. That thing happened in august. I made up my mind in July-august to tell him everything. Even i tried telling him but words didn’t came out of my mouth. So i planned meeting him, since it would be easier to tell things in person. I booked the flight on his birthday. I met him - few days after told him everything - he was mad - i cried - i should not have - but i did. Even so we communicated this thoroughly but not in details or bit by bit. Before coming to meet him my only purpose was to tell him everything but won’t come in relationship since knew it won’t be the same again.\n\nBut when i get back after meeting him, old memories and connection ignite in both of us. We got back in the relationship. It will be a year in October since we got back together.\n\nNow, for you all please don’t tell me to leave him or get away from or he deserves better. It’s our mutual decision to be in this together. I want you all to help me out. As i am weak in emotions and expressions. LDR make things worse as our love language was physical touch. I don’t know now how to care for him and how to show effort. How to show what he means to me and how i am sorry for everything i did. I kind of know that he knows the last part me being sorry for my actions. I had expressed that much. He tells me to think of that as a mistake as i am very young and things like these are very common. I don’t think like that. I think whatever i did was a choice i made and a choice never equals a mistake. \n\nI want to get better for him and make efforts but how? He trust me in one thing that i won’t cheat again and i know i won’t. I just know i can’t convince anyone. \n\nWe fight a lot now because our fundamental is weak now. And there is a gap which is making us misunderstood each other and mess things up. In terms of physical relationship it’s same as before now it wasn’t like this before but we overcome it. But other than that - things are not looking nice. What should i do now?\n\nAsk me for more details but please help me and my relationship get better\nP.s - don’t tell me to leave him", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Every relationship I’ve had so far was with men at least 10 years older.\n\nIn my last relationship (I was 24, he was 34) my ex kept trying to “teach” me things for four years straight. The age gap became really obvious in our different life goals. He wanted to move to the countryside, buy a house, have kids. I didn’t want to leave the city and I’m just not ready for children yet.\n\nFor the past two years I tried dating guys my own age, give or take a few years, and it just doesn’t work. My body doesn’t react at all (to put it bluntly, I don’t get wet when we make out) and I just don’t fall in love no matter how much I like them as people.\n\nNow I’ve gone and fallen for a 41 year old man. And of course my body reacts instantly.\n\nI do see a lot of issues with a big age gap though. Different stages in life for one. I’d still be working when a man who is 10+ years older would already be retired. I wouldn’t have the free time to actually spend with him. Some of them are already done with family planning. I still enjoy going out in the evenings and I think weekends should be full of experiences, not just TV and coffee. That’s just my experience the past few years.\n\nDo I just have to accept this? Is there really no way to change what you’re attracted to? Where does this even come from? Have other women maybe noticed that once they hit their 30s or 40s they started being more into guys their own age? Or is it more about mentality and life experience?\n\nMy family also puts a lot of pressure on me asking why I always bring home, in my dad’s words, “old geezers.” Even though I know it’s my choice I’d still like my partner to be welcomed warmly and not met with comments like “when you were born he was already 10, 15, 20.”", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

My boyfriend of 6 years and I bought a house together 3 years ago. We have definitely hit some rocky bumps along the way, especially during the 3 years we lived together, but for the most part I thought we were happy. We have talked about marriage, but he’s not ready to commit. \n\nI was accepted into a school program but the closest one was 2 hours away in person. It’s a 4 year program. Before we even started dating I made it clear that this is what I wanted to do with my life, and he was supportive. When I was even accepted, his family really discouraged him from leaving and even told me I was selfish to ask him to come with me. I discussed how this made me feel with him, and he assured me he would move down with me within a year (our house is currently under renovation that needs to be completed). I moved roughly 2 months ago and it’s been tough transitioning from seeing him every day to only seeing him once a week (props to those who go months). Two weeks ago when he visited me he was excited to move down (or so I thought). This weekend I went to visit him and he drops this bombshell on me that he actually doesn’t want to move from his friends, family, and job. \n\nI am having a really hard time processing this information. Obviously I want him to be happy, and don’t want to pull him away from everything, but this is what I worried about right after being accepting. It’s literally my worst nightmare come true. Seeing him once a week isn’t working especially because his family keeps having events the day he’s supposed to come down so then it’s sometimes 2-3 weeks in between and the times he doesn’t go to family things to see me his family makes him feel guilty for missing it. \n\nI just don’t know what to do if there even is anything I can do.

I obviously was not happy about it, but it took me no time to agree that we had to at least try. We love each other so much, and both of us know that we want to be together for a long time. He had to be back to this job pretty immediately and moved out there on Wednesday, leaving us with about three days together process this huge change. \n\nI first want to say that I'm really happy for him, the city he moved to is his dream. I always knew he'd end up there I just thought we'd have more time to prepare and that I could come with him. However, I'm absolutely devastated about this and beside myself.

In the beginning, everything feels exciting but at the back of your mind there’s that constant worry what if this doesn’t go anywhere? What if I’m just setting myself up for disappointment? It’s tough because relationships do take time to grow, and you can’t know everything about someone right away but at the same time no one wants to feel like they’re wasting months or even years on the wrong person. I think part of the struggle is figuring out when to give things a fair chance versus when to trust your gut that something isn’t working, it’s not always clear, and sometimes you only realize it in hindsight. The fear of wasting time can make it hard to relax and enjoy the process of getting to know someone because you’re always calculating the what ifs. How do you personally deal with that fear? Do you have ways of telling early on if someone is worth investing in or do you just let things play out and see where they go?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I told her that I would like to start a family with her in the future, but right now I don’t feel ready to get married, mainly because I don’t have enough money and because neither of us is working in our professional field yet. In fact, we currently work together in a place that is quite stressful.\n\nShe tells me that I need to change and act more like a man and not like a child, because I’m constantly joking around. I explain that this is just the way I am, while she is more serious. For me, making jokes is a way to cope with life and to relieve stress, although I don’t take everything as a joke. However, it bothers her, and she says she’s fed up with it.\n\nShe also points out that I should arrive at work at least 15 minutes early, while I think arriving on time is enough. I understand her sense of responsibility, but I feel these are differences in upbringing and ways of thinking.\n\nSince we work together, the tension feels even stronger. When there’s stress, I prefer to stay quiet, get the work done, and move on with my life. She, on the other hand, complains a lot and says she wants to quit because she can’t take it anymore. That drains me emotionally, because she ends up getting angry with me when it shouldn’t be that way.\n\nWhen I try to give her advice, she doesn’t want to listen and cuts off the conversation. If I were the one bringing things up about work, she tells me that I’m immature or that I play the victim.\n\nThis past year has been very difficult for me. I was fired from a job where I had been for two years, and I had to go back to this other position where I already knew the environment was stressful and, on top of that, they pay much less. Before, I used to play a lot of sports, study with more discipline, and could afford to buy myself things. Now I come home so mentally and emotionally exhausted that all I want to do is sleep.\n\nI’ve told her that I feel different, even a bit depressed, although maybe that’s not the exact word. But when I share this with her, she responds that what I’m saying doesn’t make sense, that I’m not depressed, that I’m just looking for excuses, and that I play the victim. That hurts me, because what I’m telling her is truly how I feel.\n\nShe is older than me and already has a degree, although she hasn’t found a job in her field. I’m still finishing university. She tells me that she’s close to turning 40 and that she doesn’t see progress in our relationship, especially when it comes to starting a family before it becomes complicated due to age.\n\nI want to find a way to express all of this to her without her responding with the same things as always: that I’m immature, that I play the victim, or that I make excuses. I do want something serious with her, but I feel confused and drained by these dynamics.\n\nMy question: How can I talk to her about these issues in a way that she actually listens, without immediately shutting me down or calling me immature?\n\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: I (30M) want a future with my girlfriend (36F), but she says I need to change my personality and habits to be more “mature.” We argue about work, responsibilities, and stress, and she often dismisses my feelings. I want to know how to express myself so she takes me seriously without accusing me of being immature or playing the victim.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

We met through an Xbox group post and while we were still in high school, she is three months older than me but she was a junior, and I was a senior during the time we'd send pictures when we got out and talk during the school day about what we did. She was the first girl to look at me and say I didn't look bad, and she liked me cause of how I acted, cause I was caring and how I was worried about her. She was never good at expressing herself and emotions through text, but on the phone, it was okay. She used to send pictures once ina while. I comforted her when she got stressed from work, stayed on the phone just for our presence, and a bunch of other stuff, sent relationship reels of how we want to be, and other stuff. We got close pretty quick when we had met last year she got attached to me very quick cause not even two weeks of me and her talking she had asked me \"Are we going to stay friends or is this going to be something bigger\" when i first heard that i said just friends cause it was WAY to soon but five six months later she asked again this time i had said no only for the fact that she lived in AL while im in CT. I gave it two months and asked her if she wanted to be my gf. She was quick to say yes. After that work drained her, her first job was as a waiter, and it stressed her a lot, so I was always there to comfort her and make sure she was okay. She was dry the majority of the time, but I would put in effort to make talks long over text and we'd call so we could actually talk it was great our longest call was 2 days she always had her camera on and I never turned it on because I don't like how I look but now I wish I spent more time with her. but the dryness caught up to me and I pretty much told her that I'm no longer going to try and start a conversation because there is no point to start one if its not going anywhere and that's what I wish i didn't do because she saw that as I was giving up and I don't blame her cause after that she said \"it sucks that we're not talking\" and then she said the reason she slowed down on messages was because I have a terrible sleep schedule and I never told her I was awake but at the same time I don't sleep long and i can stay up for a while with little rest. She sent intimate no nudes or anything just showing more of herself but two weeks before we broke up she deleted those pictures off snap because she \"Didn't want anyone to see them\" and \"it was more of a her thing\" and \"im growing up and i dont want that stuff on my phone\"so I had asked her if she felt like breaking up and her response \"No it just felt like we were drifting apart, has it for you\" and I was honest I said yea a couple of times but I didn't go through because I knew she was more quiet due to the stress from her job. but after that I wrote the break up message and said we should be friends and better ourselves and maybe get back together her response \"i understand and im sorry it's come down to it i would like to stay friends and maybe in the future it could work out but right now the distance is what screwed us over and i understand i should have said something sooner about the calls, you seemed so happy i didn't want to ruin it for you, and my job started to drain me so i didn't want to talk recently I hate that this happened the same time we were trying to make this work but it did, but in the end i completely understand and if you want to stay friends that is okay with me \". I applied for jibs before we broke up and i finally got a job offer from one and i was going to use that to talk to her again but i had constantly been checking her followers and following and saw her like thirst trap accounts and other men flexing off their bodies with nsfw texts and that stung and she's done this before but i told her it made me uncomfortable and she apologized and undid what she did but she unfollowed them and a couple hours after she followed them and I don't know if I should go back to talking to her to try and reconnect\n\nI can take criticism and sorry its kinda all over the place if you have any questions i most likely have answers\n\nKey things/ things i didn't know where to put in with the writing\n\nBroke up due to poor communication,\n\nshe felt ignored and i messed up by spending too much time with friends\n\nnever sent anything cause I'm broke and she wanted to send me things but i denied because I wouldn't have anything to send back\n\nshe liked and followed thirst trap and model accounts\n\nmy messed up sleep schedule made it worse\n\nshe still looks at my stories\n\ni unfollowed her on tiktok and snap\n\nshe was scared of losing me and kept telling me she wanted the relationship but it crumbled", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Within the last three years I have probably been around his daughter (14) a total of 4-5 times. Awkward.. I know. I’ve battled with this but when I say he worships her, I mean that. So, it’s hard to bring up how he acts to him when it comes to her. For my birthday he made all of these plans for me and then that Thursday, the day before we were supposed to leave for a weekend, he canceled because she decided to come down. I was upset and expressed this to him and his excuse is always “she’ll be 18 soon and I won’t get to spend time with her anymore.” Need I remind you that every time my bday month comes around, she comes down every weekend that month and then the next.. she disappears. Not only that, I’ve always taken the backseat for her. She plays sports and I’m not allowed to go to any games. She told him she didn’t like me because I didn’t get her a bday gift (our 2nd year together). Mind you.. I hardly know her because at this point I had only been around her maybe three times for less than an hour.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, I asked him to attend my kids (11M and 8M) football games. It’s always something to where he can’t attend. My boys also don’t have a father. When I left him he ditched his kids and my BF knows that and he knows how important it is for me and them, for him to show up. Well of course, he plans to come and then says he can’t because his daughter is coming down. By this point I’m fuming but I still remained calm when asking him why he’s doing this. He then blames me and says that I never understand the time he needs to spend with his daughter. When my only time bringing that up was my bday and this specific event with him attending my kids games. I’m just over it.\n\nI also realized how detailed he is with her. For her bday he talked about what he was getting her every day up until he got it. Which there’s nothing wrong with that. It just shows that he’s capable of gift giving and making plans but he doesn’t do that for me.. at all! Out of the three years we’ve been together I’ve only gotten a gift for one bday and it was a pair of converse. He never remembers what I ask for, never plans dates and actually follows through but the moment she mentions a gift she wants or somewhere she wants to go, he will literally talk about it for daaaays AND follow through.\n\nIt’s his child so I get it, I love that he loves her but sometimes I feel he’s not capable of loving anyone else. He also has an older son (21) that he hardly ever talks to or talk about. He also doesn’t call her by her name.

Despite all that, he still says he loves me and prefers calling instead. I understand him to a certain extent cause we’re in a LDR, not a normal relationship.

Even when I got up to sit somewhere else he immediately came back to me and layed his head on my chest wrapping his leg around me, asking me more questions, make me do the rice purity test, etc. He was drunk but even the next morning he immediately continued. He is generally a very touchy person however given the vibe the intensity and that going on for the whole party to me is an obvious sign someone likes you so I got curious and I was open to reciprocate. (I am btw not a dating person, I have never dated and I don’t really like touch and never care enough to persue people but when they show interest I get curious and want to see how I feel about it) \n\nFast forward him and I finally met up to eat and talk a bit, he asked about my past relationships and told me his, then we got to a park later until 1am just cuddling, being touchy and him tickling me multiple times and yeah lot’s of other stuff. We didn’t kiss bc I noticed ,and I kept that a secret, that thats sth I am uncomfortable with but he got close to my face multiple times like as if we were about to. I did at one point while cuddling give him a forehead kiss that I asked him if he wanted one. Eventually towards the end I confronted him about his intentions to which he acted all terrified and said it’s just friendly and that he’s like this with all his friends (much later I asked these friends and they said no not like that). I was pissed got up and expressed how taken advantage of I felt. Days passed and bc I knew I will see him again a lot I asked for a conversation in which he apologised said he led me on and talked about going to therapy now bc of me and genuinely wanting to regain my trust. I was vary of it but I knew I’d have my distance and could see if he really meant it and also he wasn’t finished helping me. \n\nFast forward a like 3 or 4 months pass and he comes by to help me with the project to which he was at my house and we got along again surprisingly just talking having fun which I took with a grain of salt and I wanted to address it. Before I got the chance to do that, that girl friend of mine opened up about being cheated on by a guy shes been together with for sometime now and it turned out to be that exact guy and that she knew everything that had happened between me and him as well back then ( they were already intimate with each other at that time). ( I had a suspicion already for a longer time but I was unsure esp. because he kept telling me he loves nth more than being solo and how nice it is) \n\nShe told me about how shes still trying to make their relationship work but all I could feel at that moment was discomfort about how I hang out with both of them and they were secretly together and both conscious about what happened without me knowing that. She’s been trying to get closer to me as a friend for a while now and planning many future activities with me and I really wanted it but idk how to feel anymore. \n\nNow just recently the guy told her (which she said she wanted to tell me because it would help me ‘process my emotions’) and another friend of ours that I was just an ego boost to him. That other friend also told me the way the guy told him the story he made himself passive in the storytelling, that I just tried to kiss him and he was just being friendly, and emphasised on that I was hurt by being led on and by the rejection. (To which I would like to say that I told the guy explicitly idc about relationships or rejections like that and for me what hurt me was being taken advantage of like that and put into a vulnerable position for his gratification). (Also i never really felt rejected tbh bc I didnt consider someone flriting and advancing with me and me being open  and curious about it as a rejection really but thats another topic)\n\nRight now I feel completely disgusted, disrespected and so dehumanised. I’ve been completely objectified and reduced to just an ego boost and that with the consciousness of the girl I wanted to consider my friend. She is trying to make her relationship work with the guy and apparently he puts lots of effort into it and reflects a lot to a degree my other friend is conflicted because he thinks that guy is being genuine and trying. While on the otherside the guy seems to not try to make up for me at all or care and really just admits to having used me like a tool. I dont even feel like I was seen as a friend maybe not even a person.\n\nI don’t know how it seems to be accepted by the others that that guy just objectifies me like that and just used me to boost his ego. Idk how to feel about that this was a known fact among him and the girl and I have to now rethink all my memories through that lense and the fact that he probably just saw everything I do through the lense he fabricated of ‘oh she likes me and i rejected her’. Idk if I can continue being in a friend circle where my dehumanisation to just someone pretty that can be used for ego gratification seems like an accepted thing. \n\n\nAnyone has tips how to deal with this situation or understands it? \nThanks everyone in advance!", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Leading up to the day, he seemed consistent and promising over text. I was genuinely excited and put time into getting ready — I wore an olive green silk dress, comfy heels, and a leather coat since it’s chilly here in South Africa right now.\n\nWe agreed he’d pick me up at 6 PM, but he only showed up at 6:40 and was unreachable until then. When he arrived, he was dressed very casually (definitely not “dinner date” ready). The first thing he said was, “Wow, you really prepared.” I expressed that I value time and respect, but he brushed off my concern and said I was acting like it was the end of the world.\n\nInstead of heading to dinner, he told me he had an appointment at 8 PM and wouldn’t be able to go through with our plans. Since I was already dressed up, he suggested we just get takeout instead. We drove to a pizza place, but while waiting for the order, he tried to touch me inappropriately, even after I told him to stop.\n\nWhen we got back to my apartment building, he parked in a darker corner and tried to force himself on me again. I pushed him away, grabbed my things, and left. He later kept calling and saying he “missed me,” which I found mind-boggling after what happened. I blocked him.\n\nThe next morning, I cried. Not because of him specifically, but because I felt so defeated about dating in general. I know one bad man doesn’t define my future, but experiences like this make it really hard to stay optimistic.\n\nI’m sharing this not to trauma dump, but because I think it’s important for men to realize how common and discouraging these experiences can be for women.

Is this something worth trying to reignite sometime in the future or just try to leave it and move on?\n\nI 27M broke up with my gf of 6 years 2 months ago. It was long overdue and I had checked out emotionally a while before this. Anyway, almost immediately after the split I met a girl 26F through work and we hit it off straight away. The kind of connection you only find once in a blue moon. Started off just friends but quickly became more, seeing eachother every (sometimes twice) a week. I was very honest with what’s been happening with me in terms of the recent breakup.\n\nInitially she was very keen and made me feel a bit unsure of the situation, if this was a good thing to get into etc. But shortly after I found myself really liking her, thinking of her all the time etc. I just really enjoyed her company and knew there was a connection between us. This wasn’t some one-sided delusional obsession, you know when you feel it back. Anyway she went home for a week and ever since I noticed her pulling away somewhat. We met up again and it was still great, like always. Laughing, cuddling, great sex and even meeting some close friends of hers. She felt caring and compassionate and all seemed good. Until a day later I received a message to say she was sorry but she had a great time with me but doesn’t feel like dating and that her head is all over the place. It felt very much like quite an abrupt full stop.\n\nI won’t lie, I feel gutted by this but also stupid that I let myself fall for someone so soon. But at the same time I can’t deny there must have been a real connection there. I’m assuming this is because she is uncomfortable with my situation which is absolutely fair enough and in fact I felt that way too initially.\n\nIs this now a lost cause?

This happened on a Wednesday in January, I just continued on my way home and nothing else happened. \n\nAfter these days, on Saturday my friend and I decided to go party at a bar, after this and I found this girl at the bar. So since I was drugged I had to go talk to him, it turns out that he is from the United States, the truth is I had never met a foreign person, at least I had never had a long conversation, he told me that he was traveling from California through all of Central America until he arrived here. At least she spoke Spanish because I don't know much English, from that day on I couldn't stop thinking about her and since we added each other on Instagram I decided to talk to you the next day and by the next week we had already gone out, another thing is that I am bisexual and although I knew I had never had a relationship with another woman, she was going to be here for a few weeks, which turned into 4 months and in a matter of 1 month she offered me to live where she was staying, although it was short, it was an absolutely beautiful relationship that came out of nowhere, We had a lot of connection being from such different worlds (in fact she showed me this social network and since she left I decided to use it to see what was happening) (I hope she doesn't see this because it makes her very embarrassed, I know that she usually enters this site, in fact I think she thinks I would never use this, I really liked it a lot) we met and although it was something quite quick, she was a person with whom I had a good connection, we shared ideals and life goals. She wants to travel the world and so do I, the thing is that she had the chance to do it and I have never left my country, it could be considered that I am a poor person here, although I work to get ahead it is quite hard, that is why I am grateful that she invited me to live with her these months, she knew that I had nothing and she helped me just by being together, although I must say that what I had also gave some money to help her, because she is not a person with a lot of money either, just normal. And I study and work, in addition to that with our effort and thanks to the fact that my aunt lives in Bogotá we were able to go there, to some parts of my territory, and we also went to the sea, she invited me because my birthday was coming and I lived in the center of the country so I did not know the sea, it was something so beautiful no one had ever been so special and nice to me, after being in so many relationships where everything was so dry, my love was reciprocated and it made me feel loved, I improved my English, we analyzed life and society, we went to a techno festival, we supported each other when we were super sick and we cried to each other because we knew she had to go, and she did. \n\nIn reality I was quite bad, at least I expressed it all the time, I began to feel anxiety and a lot of sadness just thinking about her leaving (although I always knew it) I think I hurt myself, because I already knew what would happen and I gave myself the opportunity to fall in love, I know it was a very short time, but as I say, I felt very loved, she did things for me that no one had done in any relationship, and it's not that I've had many, but I have had about 4 fairly long relationships, maybe I had only encountered bad guys. So I was bad and we both started to feel anxious and I think the problems began, also a bit of cultural clashes to be honest, stupid things that we started to fight about but we solved it, a lot of emotions and misunderstandings. \n\nThe latter happened in a period of two weeks, we went to the beach and when we returned she could only stay in Colombia for about 3 days where we packed all our things and gave some away, she had been in Colombia for 4 months and in Latin America for about 10 months (I think) so we started packing, I was very anxious we fought, these days we went to the bar where we met, there was not as much good music as that day, and there were few people, we danced like never before and we kissed, we cried, We took pictures, we decided to go through all the places where we spent moments so we could remember it with more nostalgia, we played a little game where we pretended to meet again, the next day we went to eat at a restaurant, we gave each other our last gifts and we cried, she cried too, after almost not seeing her cry and I was the one who did it the most, she did it, we got home, we had our last night together, we didn't fuck, we just talked, to wake up and take her to the airport in the morning, we woke up, our last day together, she played songs on the guitar, we had an alarm for when we had to leave, this alarm went off, this shitty alarm, our time was up, it felt like a stab to my heart previously shattered by life, we said goodbye to a tragic pack at the airport, I cried too much, that same day I had to go to my mother's house with my suitcase after having lived away for some time, heartbroken, I went out drinking with my friends until I waited for her call that she was gone in Los Angeles, and that's where it all ended, 5 months have passed since she left, we still talk and I can't forget her. \n\nSometimes I think that I will never get over her, it's strange, she was only here for 4 months, I've had relationships for years, I thought that this wouldn't affect me and we wouldn't talk again, she's not going to come back, at least she doesn't have a date, she wants to continue saving to be able to tour Latin America since she's a traveler, so I would have to start in Colombia, but I think that now it's difficult to get a job in the United States or something, we don't have a plan, and obviously things have changed, she has her life and I have mine, now I study and work and life is complicated, I have the dream of being an artist so I have to be focused on this, but it is difficult for me, sometimes I feel like I will never get over this. Almost every day I fantasize about her coming back. Since we can get to know each other better, plus we talk almost all the time, I think I'm not as bad as before, but I just don't know how much I can last if I continue with my crazy fantasies, I'll probably never see her again in my life, neither of us have money and the truth is what we did was crazy for love.\n\nTechnically we are now separated, but we still talk every day and tell each other our things, I still lack connection, it's obvious, plus she doesn't know much Spanish, and we are busy but on top of that we talk every day and send each other Instagram reels. \n\n\nI just wanted to vent here, I'm at a good point in my life. Although part of me wants to get over her and move on with my life, and stop thinking about her coming back, another part of me says to keep my hopes up, maybe in a few years, or if things go well for both of us, in a few months, but probably years, life is hard, I think it will take me a while to get over it, I don't know whether to keep talking to her either, since I've been thinking about her a lot, this is stupid since I know that she won't be back for a long time, it hurts me, but I don't want to stop knowing either. About her, she is a beautiful person and I appreciate her very much. \n\nI never regret living with her, I have never felt so loved, and in just 4 months, thank you for reading", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

Before we dated he created this entire personal that he was born in Sao Paul, his parents were divorced so he lived in 2 states and would come to my state every holiday, AND that he currently played basketball. He has the most AMAZING parents who have been married for decades and looks up to their relationship, he stopped playing basketball a year before I met him but he knew my type was basketball players, and he was NOT born in Sao Paul or even CLOSE, he just looks up to their soccer players.\n\nWe’ve been planning the next time I see him with his parents since our first meeting last month, it was great. Yet, I feel deceived into believing that in the early stages, he would see me very soon when in reality, he was a completely different person! He lied about his literal upbringing, hobbies, and most importantly where he lived so I could have hope to see him soon. He'd tell me, “Maybe I can come next week” “My mom says Christmas she’ll be accepting of me to go and see my dad where you are the whole summer” “I’m sorry she said no, something’s going on with my dad”. I always had this weird feeling whenever he'd say things that didn't match up, but he denied it. \n\nI want to talk to him but don't know how. Does “Hey, so I just realized you lied and created an entire persona to keep me hooked for months knowing we wouldn't see each other until we got into a relationship” work?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We’ve been talking for 10 months now. I live in Europe he lives in the US. At the start of the year he told me if we were ever to be together it would take quite some time, maybe even 2 years… he’s at a point in his life where he doesn’t know what to do… whether to go back to university and get a masters degree, change career or move back home (he wasn’t born in the US). \n\nHe’s also aware that after I graduate my plans were to try and study in the US (I’ve always wanted to do this prior to meeting him, also to clarify, my intention isn’t just to date/talk to a guy from the US with the hopes of a green card before anyone suggests this). \n\nAnyway, recently he told me he’s not ready for a relationship and I’ve been pushing him towards one and it’s making him freak out as he’s only been divorced a few years (he told me he ended things). That he’s enjoying being single etc because he can focus on his happiness and he doesn’t have to be responsible for anyone else’s (I admit there’s times where I’ve been clingy wondering why he hasn’t responded or if he’s talking to other women) he told me he’s not looking for a relationship or talking to anyone else but if he was ready for one, I would be his only choice and that there’s nobody else.\n\nCut a long story short - I called his bluff, I told him I was going to start dating other guys and that we could be friends if he was open to that. He agreed but he was very distant afterwards, it ended up in an argument and I asked him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore and he said not if we’re arguing so I told him it’s best we don’t talk and he started asking if I was for real etc. \n\nBefore he told me he didn’t miss anyone and didn’t get easily emotionally attached to anyone, not even his ex wife which is why he left her. Weeks ago told me he rarely misses people as a response to me saying I missed him. After our argument and after I said it’s best we don’t talk he told me he thinks about me throughout his day and that he misses me and if I left he would miss me a lot and that he doesn’t want things to end. \n\nI feel like this is a big thing him finally opening up to me but still I have so much to decide upon, he tells me he doesn’t want a relationship but treats it like we’re in one. Maybe I’m just too overbearing at times… I’ve been used to being lied to and cheated on that I don’t trust easily and sometimes when he goes quiet I will assume the worst. He told me he likes his own space and his ex wife never used to give him that which is part of the reason he doesn’t want a relationship.\n\nI don’t know if he will change his mind and I’m probably dumb for waiting around but after our argument I feel like I need him in my life. I hate not having him because he always gives the best advice, he’s supportive (not very emotional) but he seems to understand me - a lot of people don’t.\n\nTL:DR LDR/situationship told me he thinks about me throughout the day - not sure this means much but I found it sweet. He also told me he misses me and would miss me if we didn’t talk.

We're both 18 and he's getting his final year this year and i'm getting a job. However, even when i'm in colege which i have 10 hours outside at school (not including the 2 hours of traffic back home) and he only gets 5 to 8 hours (home by 3pm), i always want to call him first thing as i get home, even if i have to study while in call, that's what i wish to do. But he goes to sleep as soon as he gets home from school, and when he wakes up, time for gaming and friends, not me. I (F18) overthink a lot because i struggle with high cortisol production and overall just hypersensitivity (and yes i've tried medication and therapy and so far it was a temporary fix only), which makes me very clingy to him and sometimes hurt when i get little to no time to even text eachother. We met 2 times in 2 years, IRL i'm the priority, he goes out of his ways for me, he takes me to visit stuff even tho he hates museums but he knows i love it, he ignores all screen unless its to watch something with me, he wants to cuddle all the time and is overall very affectionate verbally and physically. However, in texts or calls, he rarely calls me, when he's on he's always playing games wanting to listen to music or playing with his friends (including females), otherwise he's sleeping. He often tells me he cant call me because he woint get time during the day or week but i see him in a group call playing with friends as soon as he says that, and yes, he tells me he's going to play with them because i've already comlained about how he used to not tell me when he goes to play while i'm waiting all day for him to pay attention to me.. We call like maybe once a week or something. WHich pains me, i'm a very clingy person but he is often busy with school, friends or asleep, otherwise yes he texts me a lot and also expresses that he loves me and calls me pet names but it feels dry and distant compared to how loving he was irl. It really pains me, i know i'd love to see him play irl because we're both gaming nerds and i have no issues with that, i just wish he'd play while in call with me and spend time even 5 min with me instead of his friends being his first pick when he gets time.\n\nI dont know what to do, i have no friends except my little sister, and i'm trying to make friends but they often disappear before i even get to spend more time with them. I tried multiple games to spend time alone but being lonely for multiple days is painful. I want to help myself be less dependent of him, or do something to help him with his time but i dont want to cause any argument over it.

She previously moved in with her partner after 6 months and she said it felt like they just became roommates so she’s afraid that will happen with us too.

Hi Reddit, m(25) living in Latam m(28) living in Japan. We started our relationship when he first came to Latam and I felt in love so much that we never stopped talking (January 2025). After two months in my city, he came back to Japan, he is American but actually posted in Tokyo for work. Last summer, I invested all my saving in paying my tickets to the other side of the world to come and see him. He took me to many cities in Asia and had the best time ever. I had prepared some fine earrings to ask him to be my boyfriend, he said that he wasn’t sure and decided to think. I stayed for 1.5 months in his house. After one week before finishing my trip, he answered a yes to become couple but asked me to open the relationship, I’ve been monogamous but I agreed for love. \nI came back to my country to continue with university but started planing the next trip. Things have been complicated because he is avoidant and I’m more like anxious attached. For a LatinAmerican, saving 2k usd to a flight it’s very tedious so I could save 1k usd and told him if he could help me with the rest and I’ll payback in December (he is in a very good financial situation). He said that I don’t have to worry and he will pay for the flight. He invited me to spend thanksgiving with his family in a resort and Christmas in America with his family. I was surprised but happy and I agreed. Yesterday, I received a call from him, and he said that he decided to cancel my trip to Japan because he doesn’t think it’s time to introduce me with his family. His family will be there only for thanksgiving weekend and I we panned of me staying until 23rd of December. It absolute broke my heart because I was so happy so see him again. He didn’t planned a backup plan and he said he can try to come to Latam for a weekend or something, which for me is not good because it’s not quality time for us. I was thinking of breaking up after that so I told him the many reasons I felt I deserved more than someone that once to video call once a week and see me once every year. I love him so much and hurts me to think that I won’t be able to see him and kiss him ever again, but I feel that I don’t deserve that kind of love and I would give everything of me and even get in debt to spend time with him 💔.

Our first six months were in person, we were in the same school and lived close by, so had a lot of time together. Then she moved to Canada (from South Africa where I still live) with her parents. We knew from the start she would move.\n\nWe were very naïve and very hopeful, despite being very young, both still in school (well when she moved I was already first year uni but yeah) and we thought it was worth trying. And although it was difficult at first, we adapted to the distance and the time difference and made it work. Over the months we played a lot of video games together, had calls whenever we could and yeah was nice. We did however run into a rough patch that lasted quite a while, since last year September we were growing a little bit distance in terms of romantic connection, which I think can be natural in long distance I guess, and yeah, through lack of effort in some ways on both ends there was a bit of a hole in our relationship. At the time we could never do video calls or spend proper time together because her parents did not support our relationship, and when they finally became a bit more lenient with it she was upset with me that I wasn’t all of a sudden all lovey dovey on calls and stuff like that, and yeah buy around May, maybe June we were at a breaking point, where we almost broke up due to all of this and some other clashes in the relationship where she felt I wasn’t putting in necessary effort, and I felt the same as there was so much she couldn’t sacrifice to have more time with me.\n\nBut anyway, we did manage to work through that, and things were going well, and truthfully still are, well as good as a long distance with time difference can go I suppose. Good news came later in June, being that she would be back in South Africa in August, the other side of the country though, but her parents finally agreed that i can come live with them for two weeks in the house they would be in. So I did that, I used basically all my savings and spent the two weeks with her, first time seeing eachother since she moved in March 2024.  And all went well, we had some clashes with the parents because they still don’t approve of me (very conservative Christians, they feel dating shouldn’t be a thing and especially not long distance, plus I have a tattoo and yeah they don’t like that at all. I am also very Christian, but yeah they are not forgiving with these kinds of things so).\n\nBut now we’re back home and back to distance and all still was well. However, things have started to change from both our ends, in terms of our personal lives. Her family is struggling with permenant residency still, as the job her dad has isn’t as secure as they thought, and is at risk of losing at any moment and does nothing in terms of support for getting residency. So there is a chance that in a year or so they’ll be in a different place in Canada, with a much harder time difference, or in America, or even in Australia. But not back here in South Africa. Additionally, from my side my family is struggling too. My dad’s business is failing and he is barely making enough to afford our necessities, but bills are piling and debt is rising. I am 20 so I can be independent, but I am studying right now, getting a paying job here is next to imposible while studying, and yeah the job market even after I got the degree is looking worse every day. I make money online though, I started doing youtube, and it pays me more than what my mom even makes, and my plan was to save up that money to be able to visit my gf in Canada next year, and then likely study in Canada to get my post grad and work permit there. But yeah, now im going to have to switch my focus and use my money on my family and help pay bills, cover my student fees and basically have to use whatever I can to help them. The prospect of visits, or even attempting to even move in the next 5 to 10 years is very very unlikely, if ever. And of course, with our dreams of me being able to move to her asap, yeah, its gonna make issues.\n\nSo all that said, I am afraid that through our own personal life issues with our families we’ll hold each other back. After all we are still very young, and we our still dependent on our families in a way, and cannot just move out and live our own lives, that’s imposible right now. The only thing that is holding us together rn is faith, and the hope and prayers that a miracle happens. But maybe through everything God is showing us that we shouldn’t be doing this, and we aren’t meant to be, as we previously thought.\n\nThere is the option of trying to approach the situation and see how far are we willing to go and how long are we willing to wait, because yeah, 10+ years is very likely. And how much are we willing to sacrifice, because yeah, I sacrifice as much as I can and I am always available to spend time with her as I do my work in the morning while she’s still asleep, but yeah, most days of the week we barely talk because she is just unable to make time for me most days, due to classes, family or any other reason you could imagine. It feels draining, and as much as I love her and feel like I will always love her, I am starting to feel like we are chasing a dream that is ultimately just a dream.\n\n \n\nThis was a long one, and if you are still reading, I would love any insight, opinions or even advice on what to do next, if anything.

I had no idea who he was and he initiated conversation and asked for tips with the gym etc. We quickly realized we got on very well as friends and ended up using the gym together regularly and becoming really close in the space of half a year. On many occasions he would comment about how we'd make a good couple, eventually he would start making this comment more regularly and bringing it up with me when he was drunk about how we'd be great together and explaining how he felt with me. So bare in mind he spent about 6 months chasing me, convincing me to give him a chance and explaining how good things would be with us.\n\nSkip into our relationship, were together only 4 months now and so many issues have arisen. I've had to ask him twice to remove porn pages from his social media accounts - something I never thought I'd have to do with him. On three occasions he's broken a promise to me (regarding drinking under the  influence) and made excuses each time ex. I only had one drink etc, I didn't think youd mind, it's been hours since I drank etc - even though I specifically have asked on 3 occasions not to ever put himself in that situation. He has offered to do things for me before (completely out of the blue) to the point where I am very impressed and happy that he is trying to make my life easier etc to then just not do what he said he was going to do - why say it in the first place? Anytime I bring up my feelings he gets quiet defensive and it takes him a while to come around and honestly I feel like he just tells me what he thinks I want to hear. He keeps saying he will change and I am yet to see much of a difference. We got into an argument recently as he failed to mention to me that he had kissed a very close female friend before in the past even though he is very unhappy about me having male friends in my life, whom I have had zero sexual interactions or any sort of intimacy with. I feel like there's some double standards going on as he tried to downplay the situation, but he admitted if the roles were reversed he would be very annoyed with me. I feel like he's very immature and I don't know what to do as I have developed very intense feelings for this man and Ive grown to really love him, I just can't help but feel like I'm being used for my qualities and to fill the void of loneliness. He said he loves me but I only feel it on good days, as when any sort of an issue arises he's a different man in my opinion. We have tried talking, I have raised this issues with him, he has said time and time again that he will get better, he is learning etc but I thought these were basic things - ex: don't break promises, don't follow porn accounts (he knew my views on it prior to getting into a relationship), don't say something and not do it (he only didn't do it because he decided he'd rather go to the pub instead) and just listen to the person you've upset..\n\nI don't know what more I can do, I think I just need an outsiders opinion on whether or not I'm just being a dumb woman in love. I have been single for years and really enjoy this man but I'm finding it very difficult to get over some of these things as I'm thinking into the future if it's like this already how on earth will it be in a year or mores time?\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated please and thank you.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I was trying to communicate that I feel like she's not being as open or direct with her own feelings, and it's making me feel stuck.\n\nHere is the exact message I sent her (translated from Hindi to English):\n\n>This is why it feels even more suffocating, that I'm doing everything you're telling me to, but still, distance keeps growing.

Your unemotional unavailability and suppression is leading to this. But you don't want to address this.\n\nI was completely taken aback by her response. My intention was to open up and ask for more open communication from her, but she immediately turned it around and said it was my fault, calling me \"unemotionally unavailable.\"\n\nWhile I don't feel like I was blaming her, I can see how my frustration might have come across that way.

{"id": "u/FrostingMuch7129_970", "user": "u/FrostingMuch7129", "text": "How can I (24f) express that I need more emotional closeness from my bf (27m)\n\nLately, I’ve been feeling that we’re often going in circles in our relationship. I notice that he is often emotionally distant and tends to respond in a practical, rather than emotionally supportive, way when I react emotionally. Sometimes it even feels like my emotionality is a bit of an “inconvenience” for him. At the same time, I understand him, because we are very different people: I am more emotional, and he is more practical. I also know that he often feels that a lot is resting on his shoulders due to our long-distance relationship, the planning of our move, and the visa process, because he is the one who will make most of the money to support us. I recognize that I can work on how I react in certain situations, but I also need support so I don’t feel alone with my emotions, otherwise it only makes everything worse.\n\nA current example is our discussion about our wedding and the visa process. The easiest way for me to live in his country would be to get married. We considered starting the engagement visa first, since the process can take six to eight months before everything is approved. However, I would like a proper proposal and a small celebration, which delays things because we need to save money for that. Emotionally, I am torn: on one hand, I want to be with him, because I am ready to start my life with him now. On the other hand, I also want certain things, like a proper celebration, which is hard for me to give up.\n\nWhen I talked to him about how I feel today, his reaction was rather distant and pragmatic. He said we could have already taken care of everything by simply signing the papers without any celebration. In that situation, I would have liked more emotional closeness from him instead of practical answers, because I felt alone with my emotions. At the same time, I understand that he feels stressed carrying the responsibility for the getting these things started and our financial situation, and that it overwhelms him when I also react so emotionally.\n\nIt’s important to me to be able to tell him that I need more emotional closeness, even though I know I also need to learn to handle some things better. But I can’t just suppress my feelings, and I don’t want to feel alone with them. At the same time, I want to learn how to take some weight off his shoulders. However, I feel that he often takes things on automatically without including me. For example, I don’t have a complete overview of what is needed for the visa process. When I ask, he says he will include me, but then he takes care of it himself. I wish we could find a compromise: that he shows me where he really needs my support, and that I can tell him when I need emotional closeness.\n\nAnother issue in our relationship is that he feels like I can’t handle being in my home country alone, because I cry and feel very sad a lot of times. This stresses him even more, because he feels responsible for me, which adds to the weight already on his shoulders. I want to make it clear that it’s not that I can’t manage being without him. Rather, the distance itself makes me feel emotionally more distant and uncertain about our relationship, and I cry because that is my way of expressing my emotions.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship, emotional closeness worked very well. He used to write long messages in the evening, telling me how much he loves me, how much he values me, and how much our relationship means to him. Reading those messages in the morning made me feel emotionally closer to him, even when he was sometimes less emotionally expressive or a bit distant in other areas. Nowadays, he no longer writes such messages, and I think this is one reason why I feel more emotionally distant and feel that something is missing in our relationship. I’m not saying he has to start writing these messages again, but we need to find another way to restore emotional closeness.\n\nWhen we are together in person, it’s easier for me to read his emotions: I can see his body language and facial expressions, which makes him feel less distant.

I was struggling heavily with grief about 2 weeks ago and while the \"grieving\" portion has subsided, I am still struggling with my overall mental health. I'm sleeping in strange blocks of time, trying to hold down a very busy job (I'm in a leadership role which my boss has acknowledged has been impacted by business changes so I am under a lot of pressure and having to work extra however my contract is salary and requires \"reasonable overtime\". The expectation + lack of instant reward is adding a lot of stress/pressure. My boss usually rewards me with a bonus at Christmas though so I don't want to ruin the working relationship by asking for a reward now LOL)\n2. My partner agreed to move out to me long term before we ever got too serious and even now alludes to doing that but we have no \"end date\" because he has no timeline. He says he wants certain things for our future but doesn't \"plan\" in the same way I do. He said he will keep me updated with his progress but in the last 2 months I haven't seen any progress (we have been talking for 1.5 years and first met in May this year). I have told him that this doesn't make me feel secure about my future but I genuinely feel like him agreeing to keep me updated was his way of trying to comfort me / his idea of a reasonable compromise. The whole thing is adding to my anxiety and I don't want to be a butthole about it. (Does anyone else not have a general idea of the end date? I genuinely see this as a pattern of his personality and not intentionally dismissive etc). \n3. Because of my high anxiety / depression at the moment I am exhausted in general and struggling to show up in the relationship. Most days I don't even feel like talking. I don't want to get out of bed. But it's not isolated to my romantic rlationship alone. I'm not seeing my friends or family either and am struggling to even get to work. I'm doing my best to consistently remain in contact with them because I know its necessary to keep this thing going - I want to be with this person - I just don't want to do LDR right now. \n4. When I visit they want to introduce me to all their friends and family which I think is really reasonable but for some reason I'm focusing on that now and on the fact that I couldn't do that NOW. I'm concerned the feeling won't go away and I might need to postpone. I'm not in the right mental frame of mind for meeting all these new people and it all feels so heavy. \n\nThe visit is awhile away yet so I don't know whether to see how I feel closer to the event (this is what my parents think I should do) or whether I should tell him now so he feels prepared if I do need to postpone the trip?

We’ve spent the past few years going back and forth between the US and Spain, meeting each other’s families, and even moving my cat to Spain. Then I got really sick, and he stepped up in every way—taking care of me through hospital stays, feeding me, even dealing with bedpans. After everything, we’ve decided to get married so we can finally be in the same place for good. I am open to any questions.\n\n\n-\nI saw a post earlier where someone was bashing long-distance relationships, saying they only ever saw people struggling. So, I wanted to share my story—one with a happy ending. It’s long, but I wanted to share everything.\n\nI (23F) met my partner (27M) on an app in 2021—the day after my 20th birthday. Neither of us was looking for a relationship; we just wanted someone to “chat” with. But we were instantly smitten. We texted all day, called for hours whenever we could, and basically became each other’s favorite part of the day. I’ve always fallen fast, but I never expected anyone to stay. At the time, I had a lot of unprocessed trauma, but he never left—always kind, attentive, and genuinely interested in whatever I had to say.\n\nAbout 6 months later, he flew from Spain to visit me in the US for 2 weeks. We went to NYC, he met my family and friends, and he saw a bit of my “crazy.” It was heartbreaking when he left, but it made us certain we wanted to be together. He was hesitant about monogamy at first, but a month later, we made it official.\n\nSix months after his visit, I went to Spain for 2 weeks. I met his friends, his family, and his incredibly welcoming community. His parents even took us on a trip to Sevilla to show me all the history.\n\nWhen I got home, things took a turn. I’d contracted a bacterial infection in Spain that went undiagnosed for 8 months. My family thought I’d gotten sick from heartbreak (which was… infuriating). In October, he came back to the US for 3 months. My health was declining, so he took on a caregiving role while also becoming close to my family. When he left right before Christmas, I went with him to Spain, got medical treatment there, and lived with him and his parents for 3 months. My health was rough, but our relationship only grew stronger.\n\nWe decided to close the distance. The plan was for me to go home for a few months, then return to Spain to work on a visa. I had even brought my cat to live with his parents so she was already there. When I returned to Spain, we planned to move into our own apartment (and got permission for my cat). Having our own space gave me so much hope.\n\nThen things crashed. I became severely ill—bedbound, in and out of the hospital. He had to feed me, manage bedpans, and navigate a small-town hospital that didn’t know what to do with me. My mom flew in for a month to help get me home. Through it all, he never left my side, spending every night on a terrible cot at the hospital, stroking my face because it was the only place I could handle touch, and telling me things would get better.\n\nI made it back to my parents’ house in the US in November 2024. I haven’t been healthy enough to travel since, so he’s been flying here every 2–3 months to visit. We keep setting goals for me to return, but I keep missing them.\n\nSo… we made a different decision. My goal is to go back in December, but if I can’t, we’ve decided to get married so he can stay here. Not the big proposal and wedding I dreamed of (that will come later when I’m healthier), but something simple now—gold bands, a casual white dress, his mom flying in when we sign the papers. The process is long: fiancé visa approval takes 6–9 months, then marriage, then his green card.\n\nOne of the things that makes this feel so real and special is how our families have become one. My parents love him, his parents love me, and everyone has been completely supportive of our relationship and our decision to get married. When he visits the US, my mom treats him like a son, and when I’m in Spain, his parents treat me like a daughter. They’ve been there for us through every challenge—cheering us on, sitting with me in hospitals, and helping us figure out how to make the distance work. It’s rare in a long-distance relationship to have both sides fully in it, but ours are—and that support has made all the difference.\n\nOur story isn’t over yet, but I do see it as a happy ending. I have the most kind, wonderful human I’ve ever known—someone who’s stayed when most would have left. In the chronic illness community, it’s rare to have someone not just stick by you, but do everything possible to make your life better.

We live about three hours apart. We clicked fast on voice notes—deep chats, values, family stories. He was driving past my city on the way to see his family, so we met for a first date: a walk in a beautiful park with his dog. Easy conversation. We scheduled a second date for about two and a half weeks later when he’d be passing through again.\n\nBetween dates we talked every day by audio, even while he was in Italy with family and friends for wedding plans. He sent photos with his family, I shared my world too. It felt like a real connection forming.\n\nA week before date two he said a friend from abroad was visiting and he wouldn’t be able to reply much. I appreciated the transparency and let it be. After the visit he said the weekend was intense and he’d rather answer the audios in person.\n\nDate two came. He arrived about thirty minutes late after a long drive. We had breakfast, the banter was good, nothing physical happened which I was fine with—it’s still early. He was heading on to a mountain trip with colleagues. I didn’t follow up after, but he texted that night to thank me, apologized for being late, and said he’d reach out the next day.\n\nThe next night he sent a long message saying that with the distance and seeing each other so infrequently it’s hard for him to build the connection he wants, and it would only get harder once he was back in to a even further a way place where he is doing his PhD (making distance from 3 hours to 4). He said he preferred to stop here, that he enjoyed meeting me, and wished me well.\n\nI replied politely. Later I asked for feedback…was it mainly distance or just not feeling it. He sent an audio saying the connection was there but he didn’t feel the spark, and he couldn’t tell if that was because of distance or if it would be the same even in the same city. He offered friendship and said if I’m ever in his city he’d show me around. I declined the friendship lane.\n\nMy read: the turn started during that four-day gap with his friends. He mentioned more people joined, including girls. After that his energy cooled, the voice notes stopped, he was late to the date, and then he closed it. It feels like proximity won: either he met or re-sparked something local, or the gap simply exposed that his pull for me wasn’t strong enough to pay the distance tax. I don’t think I imagined the connection—he shared a lot—but connection and spark are different, and distance magnifies that difference.\n\nI’m calm and slow-to-warm, so I’m trying to keep things romantic rather than pen-pal next time. If you’ve been in a similar spot, how did you keep momentum when you live a few hours apart?\n\nPs: he was in a previous relationship where the distance was 7 hours, and the miles were usually mostly done by him.\n\n\nTL;DR: strong connection over daily voice notes, two dates, then he ended it with “connection yes, no spark—distance makes it hard.” I think proximity and low tolerance for distance decided it.

We do get on video calls often, and he has seen pictures of me. For reference, I am approx 250 lbs and 5 foot 6. I have told him that I am heavier than I look in pics and on cam, and he says there is no issue with that at all but he has been with a woman as large as me. As of today, we both confessed that we are falling in love but we are both afraid that the connection we have now will be different when we meet in person, but he is planning a trip to come and see me next month to find out how real this is.\n\nWhen on cam or in pics, I VERY MILDLY edit them so that I don't have bags under my eyes or dark spots on my skin - but I do NOT change my facial structure or put fake make up filters on or any of that catfishy stuff. I simply wanted to present myself in the best light possible for him while we were getting to know each other. When we are on cam, I never stand up to show him my belly because I am ashamed of it. I am currently losing weight, but I have a very long way to go. My largest fear is that he will see me in person and will not be attracted to me without the limited perspectives he has been shown up to this point. He says he is aware that bodies change as we age and that my weight may go up or down but he is attracted to me for who and what I am, not what my body looks like because he has not met me in person, nor has he seen a full body pic of me. I want him to know what he will be coming overseas for, and I want him to see all of my imperfections before he buys his non-refundable ticket. I am terrified that when I do, he will no longer want me and I will lose him. I am afraid that all of this connection we believe we have will vanish if I am not exactly what he has built me up to be in his mind by filling in the blanks with rose colored glasses.\n\nOur connection feels so strong and we are such excellent communicators that I honestly feel like he is my person, the one I wasn't looking for but was always destined to find. He says he looks at me and sees his wife. I can't bear the thought of him rejecting me because I wasn't 100% transparent about my physical beauty. \n\nDo you think that our connection can be enough for him to still love me, even if I am not as good looking as he imagined me to be?

This is my first post in this community, and I’m hoping you guys will be able to help me and my bf out!\n\nMe and my boyfriend are currently long distance because I’m on a leave of absence from college until the spring. We’re able to see each other every once in a while, but not often and not consistently. When we’re together physically, we’re fine! We might disagree occasionally but overall the relationship is very solid and satisfying for the both of us.\n\nHowever, as soon as we’re apart again, we’re worse. It’s like an immediate vibe switch. We disagree and argue more, and most of our (short) phone calls are long, unhappy discussions about how we’re unsatisfied with long distance.\n\nOne major problem my boyfriend has is that we argue a lot more, and he isn’t happy with how often we have conflict. I understand, so I pitched we start reading Fight Right together because it came highly recommended. I recently started reading, and he said he’s going to start reading relatively soon. I also tend to be a complainer and it’s wearing on him.\n\nA problem I have is that I feel like I put more effort into our long distance relationship than he does. I’m the one pitching virtual date ideas, asking to call, initiating most text conversations, trying to problem solve conflicts we have, etc. This has taken a toll on me because I feel like I’m putting in a lot more time and energy, and getting very little back. He recently has been texting more often and initiating conversation, which I appreciate and have let him know, but he is really reluctant to do any kind of virtual date besides occasionally watching movies. He says that it’s because long distance is boring and unfulfilling to him, and he has no motivation to put in any effort. He wants to stay with me because he loves me (and because we’ll stop being long distance in January) but long distance feels like a cheap imitation of being together in person.\n\nThis post is obviously biased because my boyfriend isn’t here to give his feedback, but yeah! Any advice would be helpful. How do you minimize arguing in a LDR? Any books you recommend? How can I start being more positive when we call? And what about my problems with putting in more effort?

Neither of us were looking for love, but our initial connection went beyond friendship and now we have been talking about a real future together. We do get on video calls often, and he has seen pictures of me. For reference, I am approx 250 lbs and 5 foot 6. I have told him that I am heavier than I look in pics and on cam, and he says there is no issue with that at all but he has been with a woman as large as me. As of today, we both confessed that we are falling in love but we are both afraid that the connection we have now will be different when we meet in person, but he is planning a trip to come and see me next month to find out how real this is.\n\nWhen on cam or in pics, I VERY MILDLY edit them so that I don't have bags under my eyes or dark spots on my skin - but I do NOT change my facial structure or put fake make up filters on or any of that catfishy stuff. I simply wanted to present myself in the best light possible for him while we were getting to know each other. When we are on cam, I never stand up to show him my belly because I am ashamed of it. I am currently losing weight, but I have a very long way to go. My largest fear is that he will see me in person and will not be attracted to me without the limited perspectives he has been shown up to this point. He says he is aware that bodies change as we age and that my weight may go up or down but he is attracted to me for who and what I am, not what my body looks like because he has not met me in person, nor has he seen a full body pic of me. I want him to know what he will be coming overseas for, and I want him to see all of my imperfections before he buys his non-refundable ticket. I am terrified that when I do, he will no longer want me and I will lose him. I am afraid that all of this connection we believe we have will vanish if I am not exactly what he has built me up to be in his mind by filling in the blanks with rose colored glasses.\n\nOur connection feels so strong and we are such excellent communicators that I honestly feel like he is my person, the one I wasn't looking for but was always destined to find. He says he looks at me and sees his wife. I can't bear the thought of him rejecting me because I wasn't 100% transparent about my physical beauty. \n\nDo you think that our connection can be enough for him to still love me, even if I am not as good looking as he imagined me to be? Is what I am doing a form of deception or lie? Should I send him full body pics and just see what happens? I haven't ever felt like this about someone and I am terrified that it may all come crashing down. Please help because I am having panic attacks and I feel like maybe I should just end it before I waste any more of his time.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We met when out 5 months ago when I was visiting family in Italy. Im from US. I’ve seen him for a full week of each month so far, he’s in college and my family loves seeing me so it’s working out that I’m coming. He did visit me in July though. I know basic Italian but since being with him have learned more and the effort. He does not have poor english, it was always easy to talk back and forth. But now I’m questioning just how much the language barrier affects him I guess mentally? I just came back home, we went out on the weekend drinking with friends and he def drank too much. Slurring his words in both languages, switching between them.. By the time we were home I was like let’s go to sleep. I mentioned that I couldn’t understand him in an annoyed way. I don’t like to get super drunk so don’t like it in others lol. He then got annoyed saying he never asks me to talk slower because I never did cuz I don’t care and so because of that “a lot of the time” he doesn’t know what I’m saying. He’s very respectful and still was then but I knew it wasn’t true because we talk fine?? After we woke I told him I didn’t know that actually was a problem, and of course he confirmed that it wasn’t but was in the past. But it’s like he expects me to know way more Italian, he’s improved seemingly more than me because he already knew so much and just been perfecting it daily. And I’m also the one that pursued him in the way that he told me he figured I wouldn’t want a relationship like that (long distance) so he was just gonna let go of the thought of me that way even though he felt what I did. The same as in I’ve never met someone before that just made me so happy being around them like I did. And I would not want a long distance relationship, but he’s just special lol. I didn’t know his age when we met, I guess I assumed at least 21 because I wasn’t thinking about how 18 is the drinking age\n\nBut as of lately I’m just randomly paranoid that he will hook up with a girl because I know it sounds stupid, but because he is attractive and guess I’m making stereotypes because of his age, that younger guys just want that. He also said in the past that he can’t wait until I’m so fluent so we can do it in his language and it feel just as natural for me or whatever. So that also is feeding my paranoia because “why wouldn’t he want someone who speaks his native language”? I guess you would say I’m the dominant one, so it just seems pathetic for me to be like I think you’re doing something wrong even though there’s no reason. Especially when I have soo much that confirms the opposite. In the beginning of August when I was there he introduce me to a good friend that was traveling when we got together so I never met him and my bf kinda got embarrassed but in a cute way about  the dude saying that I’m all he talks about. \n\nHas anyone been in something similar??, I’ve been in 3 relationships, longest being 1 year.

We only have an hour difference in timezone.\n\nMy partner is very sweet, but he's not the best at long distance. I feel like I'm always the one initiating or coming up with ideas for shared activities; movie nights, calls, I even made a Pinterest board and a playlist. He hadn't posted anything on them for weeks until I brought it up and mentioned how it's just one of the ways I feel loved. He posts now more frequently, maybe a song/post or two every few days. But I can't help but feel like it's forced. It didn't come naturally to him. And when we had discussed it, he told me how he just doesn't listen to lyrical songs that would be appropriate for the playlist.\n\nHe always sends a good morning text but throughout the day we mostly send intermittent texts as we're both busy. I had to ask him to send me goodnight texts which he has been doing now. He's been sick these past few days, but last night we happened to be online at the same time before he slept. He didn't acknowledge my presence at all, no show of excitement that \"omg you're here!\" (which, normally I'd be like with friends, family or my partner). He abruptly left after saying goodnight (in a loving way btw, emojis and all, but it was still abrupt despite knowing I was online). Even though he asked how I was (in response to older texts), he didn't even stay an extra minute to actually know before he slept...\n\nIt hurt me a lot because it reminded me of all the ways I go unacknowledged in the relationship. I try to make conversation over things that have been on my mind, for e.g., planes. I noticed a bunch of planes/helicopters fly by recently and taking different routes, and he asked me what I think is going on. I sent him some voicenotes...he listened to them, but never responds to them. I just feel like our convos always reach a dead end. There's barely any engagement aside from him asking me what I've eaten and how I'm feeling, that's about it. The mental stimulation is at an all time low and even when I try to enhance it, I feel like it's all my effort.\n\nKeep in mind, he's always down to call, videocall, watch movies...whatever I'm down for, as long as he's free, and he does so willingly...but there is very little initiative on his part to start an activity. Although when I do ask, he will be the one to set it up and have whatever show or movie I want ready. I asked if we could call every day even for a few mins at the end of the day, he was happy with the idea and said he'd love to, but there's no follow up. I asked him to do a personality test (for fun) months ago, and he still hasn't done it. It only takes 10 mins. Every time I ask, he says he was planning on doing it over the weekend.\n\nThe only time I really feel his mental/emotional presence is when I tell him I'm feeling bad; he reads all my texts, listens to my voicenotes, addresses my concerns. But I just wish he wasn't as absent on the good days and more present. I have discussed this with him but I just don't know what to do. He works from 9am - 6:30pm, goes to bed around 12ish, I do have a rich life outside of him, and engage with other facets of my life and take care of myself, and yet I still feel so depleted in the relationship.\n\nIn person, I would state my preference for outings, and he'd try his best to make that happen. He took really good care of me, and when I traveled again, he had sent me food, drinks, flowers, a teddy bear & note card when I got sick. So he has it in him, but idk what's going on or how to even address this issue...", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

He is in the Navy and he’s doing training right now so he doesn’t know where he will be next or really what his next steps are. \n\nI have an issue with overthinking and comparison, and yesterday my boyfriend basically said “IF we get married” and it made me kind of confused. Later on we talked about it and he said that we need to spend more time together IRL before we start planning our future. He says said he cannot say with 100% confidence that we will get married, however he wants to one day and he does see a future with me, he’s just not ready to commit to a decision like that right now. \n\nI’m not looking to get married anytime soon either, and I undertsand he’s not in the position to plan anything for certain right now, but I think he might just be being rational.

I told her that while I understand and sympathize, that is a huge red flag at this point and that we needed to have this conversation much sooner.

I pushed back on a false accusation about leaving the freezer open, mirrored her style about cleanliness, and she escalated into shouting and smashing things. I feel targeted and unsure whether to keep pushing back or involve the landlord.\n\nHi all, I posted here before about my housemate who constantly nitpicks, inspects the kitchen after I use it, and waits until I leave my room to confront me about small things. For example, she once accused me of not taking “my” post when it was actually hers, and another time claimed the sink wasn’t accessible because I left an empty noodle packet on the side while I was still cooking.\n\nThis week, she accused me of leaving the freezer open. I pushed back and explained that the top drawers are mine (mostly empty), but the bottom drawers are hers and packed full, and that the landlord actually told me the freezer should’ve been defrosted before I moved in. I also pointed out other issues like pubes in the bathroom and bad smells in the kitchen.\n\nI mirrored her style and said, “Please ensure the flat’s cleanliness and hygiene are in line with the landlord’s rules so that it remains accessible for both of us to use.” She got visibly shocked and told me, “I can’t believe you’re trying to tell me what to do. I’ve been telling you what to do since you moved in, why are you breaking the dynamic?” Then she started shouting and ranting at me in the kitchen. I waited until she finished and said “we’ll talk once you’ve calmed down, any other issue speak to your landlord” with a straight face and monotone and went to my room. She started smashing something in the sink and kept shouting for an hour. \n\nAt this point, I feel like she’s targeting me, and now that I’ve pushed back she’s escalating. I haven’t taken this to the landlord formally yet, but I know I might have to if it keeps going. I’ve kept track of all of the issues by date but haven’t collected any evidence, I guess that’s my next move.\n\nMy question: how do I handle her now that she’s shown she’ll escalate if I challenge her?

For example he used to lie about what was he doing just small things like “I didn’t do anything today I js stayed at home”“I went with my family to buy some food”and when I confronted him about it he just said that he is afraid of not being interested enough and scared of my leaving him. So we talked about, he said he would not lie again because I really love him and find interesting about him even if he doesn’t do anything. We shared our social media accounts and when I met him and got in the relationship he always said he lived in a specific city. Then I was just curious about reading some chats and found out he doesn’t even live there and he lives in a whole different town also making plans to go to parties with friends (he told me about the party and even sent pictures of it) but that whole time I thought that was in the specific city he told me before, turns out he lives like 4 hours away from that place and when i confronted him again he started getting anxious and nervous about “being afraid of telling where he is from because its really boring and he only goes to the specific city when he was studying “ I was really disappointed because he told he would not do it again and that he doesn’t know why he lies. I really think that was stupid because I told him I am not from a good place, I lived in towns my whole life so why would he feel like that’s something to be embarrassed about when i come from one? Gotta admit, yeah his family is good economically more than my family, having like 2 houses or 3 in different places so why lying about it?. Well we also talked about it, I talked about how I always tell him everything, I’m like an open book and I don’t know how to feel about this. Yesterday was my birthday and he always post his friends in social media, saying congratulations and posting photos of them in his story. I don’t really like my birthday and he asked if he could post about my birthday, I told yeah I had no problem with it because even though I don’t find my birthday exciting I wouldn’t say no to a cute act of love. I spent all day waiting for him to post me on his social media because he is always like “I want the whole world to know I really love you I dont care” And then I told him why he didn’t post about me and that I felt bad now asking for it because I want him to do it without asking like he does with his friends. He told that he thought it was a bad idea since I don’t like my birthday that much and that he sorry we would do it right now.  I took a quick screenshot about how many people he had hiding from stories before, (it was 20) and then after he posted me I just went to check and he hides his story for (58 people????)  this was in instagram btw. He never did that with the people he loved and that really broke me. Again, I confronted him about it and he said he didn’t do anything,  then i sent the screenshots and he just started getting nervous and anxious saying he sorry and He doesn’t know why he didn’t that. At that time I was going to a restaurant with my family to celebrate and got really sad because I always post about him and how I love him and I just feel he’s trying to hide myself from other people? The same happened in tiktok like doing a joke in our stories saying “I love my partner so much” I checked his account and the search history said “how to hide my story for certain people” at that time I just ignored it and deleted it but now that this happened in my birthday makes me think he feels embarrassed about me or he doesn’t want other specific people to know (in that tiktok account he only had online friends added and not even a single relative or irl friend) and then i added that situation to the topic yesterday along with the instagram topic and he just kept saying that hes sorry.

I'm in my final year of university and just mentioned to him that I'm starting to look at companies to apply for near him to hopefully be able to have a job lined up by the time I graduate this spring. Now he's talking about maybe having second thoughts on the whole thins since he's worried thing might not work out between us since he's not sure about how our dynamic will feel when we're in person long-term together.\n\nAt the beginning of our relationship he was able to move to campus much closer to me for his schooling (only a five hour drive!!), so we were able to visit each other much more frequently. I'd spend most of my week-long school breaks with him and we'd try to spend every other weekend together, and it was the happiest I've ever been.\n\nOnce he graduated he had to move further away again to do a specialty program and lost a lot of his free time, so it was a drastic change for us only being able to call and talk to each other for thirty mins a day. I was only able to come visit him for two weekends the entire six months his program lasted for with how strict their commitment was. It was really difficult for him to keep the 'spark' we had alive due to not being able to talk or text at all for so long. He said it felt like he didn't even have a girlfriend at that point. But when we're able to see each other again things always get so much better.\n\nHe's had to move to the opposite coast fall of last year, and with the three hour time difference between us, it's still difficult to be able to talk as much as we used to in the beginning, but we're able to have nightly calls pretty much everyday and lil gaming sessions on the weekends. With my school schedule, I'm able to go visit about a week every two months, but our situation is still pretty difficult for him with the lack of quality time and physical touch.\n\nHe still has some doubts and doesn't feel '100%' since we've been doing long-distance for so long it's difficult to maintain a connection with all the highs and lows. Things are still so amazing when we're together, it just hurts so much in time in between them feeling like things are fading. He used to be more sure that once we closed the gap things would get a lot better, but now he's starting to have doubts. I feel like they're similar to the ones I have about uprooting my life and moving to another country, but I feel like the risk is worth it for a chance at us.\n\nFor both of us, this is our first long-term relationship, so I'm not sure if these are just normal feelings when it comes to moving on to a next step, or if its actually a sign of incompatibility or the relationship actually crumbling.

I called her in the afternoon and when she picked up the call, it felt as if I am interrupting her.\n\nWhile texting after returning to home, I said that I miss her very much and idk how she copes with this distance, she said that it sucks.

It is a long distance thing for now, as we live 5 hours apart but we met and had an amazing connection, we can talk for hours about deep stuff, and for me this is so hard to find in the gay community. And yeah we only met 2 weeks ago but that's just how strong our connection was, we talk all day every day, and he's even interested in moving close to me or me moving close to him in the next ~3 months if things go well. If he's talking about that then I would think he would want to delete the apps. He's the one taking things to the next level, asking me to be his boyfriend, talking about moving in eventually, but with the apps on his phone. I was the one to tell him we just met, let's get to know each other for a while then we can think about moving in.\n\n\nOr is this where I'm exhausting? Is it okay to be in an exclusive relationship and still use dating and hookup apps? Because I always thought that was a no-no.\n\n\nTLDR: new bf has dating apps still on his phone, despite me telling him it makes me uncomfortable/insecure. Am  I the problem?

I moved out into my own apartment early (at 16), because I lived in an abusive household. I met him when I moved away from my hometown and became independent in the town that he lived. He was of course, living a “regular” childhood at home, while I was struggling, and sometimes just literally starving. It was hard. Because of this, there were a lot of years when we weren’t on the same page maturity wise.  I had been paying for bills and buying groceries in my childhood home since I was 13. I was able to do so by working several jobs under the table. He had been living what I would consider a mostly regular life. He grew up pretty disadvantaged as well, but he always had food, a home and a safe bed to go home to. \n\nFast forward three years, we have moved in together and are roommates with several other people in a college town. I’m going to school and working full time, while he is working full time. The roommates throw a party, one thing leads to another and there is a fight. Looking back, I can’t even remember what started it, but it was about me. I think another man looked at me in a way that made my now husband upset and he lost it? I truly don’t know, but what happened next scared me. Everyone in the party did everything they could to split them up. That ended up with me, his sister, him and a few other people in one room. The other fighting party in another, with some other people I’m guessing? I tried to block the door of the room we were in so that my now husband, wouldn’t leave to fight this other guy. I was a total mess, crying with my arms spread wide facing him in front of the door. I was so confident that no matter how mad he was, he wouldn’t hurt me. I was wrong.\n\nI remember him grabbing me by the throat, then I remember gasping for air on the floor with people screaming-including his sister. Apparently I’d been choked and thrown to the floor by my throat and neck. According to those that were there, I landed flat on my back and hand the wind knocked out of me.\nIt took a long time, but I forgave him. I would have told anyone that I loved to run, I would have begged them to do so. I know how stupid I was the time to not leave, but I didn’t  and no one asked me to do so. \n\nFast forward again, seven years later. My mom passed away and I had become the only person able or responsible enough to handle the final details. I was 27 years old, had barely any money scrapped away to take care of her final arrangements, and most significantly, I was in no mental capacity to do so. My now husband, was there supportive, and helped me throughout every step. We made it through, but barely. \n\nThroughout those years, I had lost so many people, but this was the hardest. I was sad, filled with anxiety and depressed. After she died, we were still intimate, but not nearly as regularly as we had been. \n\nSoon after her 1 year death anniversary, I was a wreck. My husband, took me out for dinner to try to cheer me up. I went begrudgingly. We ordered very strong drinks and by the time we got home I knew I was drunk. I had a sick feeling in my stomach (more ways than one), and was worried that with the way he had been acting, he would want more than to just go to sleep.I told him that I was drunk, I was really sad, and I was worried I would get sick from how much I drank. I begged him to please just let me sleep that night. I begged him not to touch me. Then I foolishly and drunkenly went to bed after creating a stupid pillow fort around me on my side of the bed as a deterrent.\n\nI woke up around 3am, still drunk and confused. I won’t get into details but he was in the act of SA-ing me. It was horrible. Horrible isn’t even enough to describe it, but the fall out was worse. I’ve been in and out of depression since and I haven’t been able to sleep when I’m in the same room as him. I have night terrors regularly and every time we fight, I lock myself in the guest bedroom out of fear-even for small fights.\n\nI’ve told you all the worst of it. Two really terrible moments in 13 years. We’ve had 13 years where he was my person and truly the only one in my corner. I love him dearly and I don’t know how I could go on being alone. I just don’t know how to get past this incident. If you are together long enough, something horrible is bound to happen. I know horrible things happen in other relationships too and I’m not near the only one.

One day decided to drop my plan as I had a job well settled life same city as my babe. I told I am dropping the plan and she said if you don’t go there then there is no chance you ll be earning more than me (I was earning 50K per month in Pune with 2 years of experience and nice senior position in a company and her was 60 K). As I was a mechanical engineer I felt that is valid argument so she told me if you drop the plan of MS then we cannot get married as I ll be earning. I don’t wanted that to be the case so I moved Germany last year and I got a public uni here. She was really emotional when I told her in some months I will be going and she wanted spend every single moment with me then. We were really in nice place until the first 6 months. Later my life got real serious and hers too. We had fights there and I used to have no contact for somedays. Also then we got our shit together at some point. Then I came back after 10 months and it was her birthday. I told her I am coming. She was happy and me too. When I met her it felt weird we couldn’t even touch each other or holding hands felt awkward. After a week we discussed what’s happening as I felt she was trying to avoid me. She told me I don’t treat her well as I get shutdown after the fights and stuff. I said I am sorry and I understood that I made a really big mistake shutting down. She told me we cannot get married if we are going to fight like this and I am rethinking whether we shall move forward or not I told her I am here for only 4 weeks and let’s close this gap together.

Recently I started feeling emotionally distant due to the lack of quality time I think we spend together. We both have full time jobs, and he has an additional part time job that he works for fun that takes up a decent amount of him time on the weekends (ideally I wish he’d stop working this job because I can see that it’s burning him out but that’s a whole other issue).\n\nMost of the time we spend together is co-existing in our apartment either doing separate activities, for example I’m reading while he’s gaming, or we are watching tv together. While I do value this time together and the fact that we can coexist, I really want more intentional quality time together. So I brought this up to him, unfortunately throughout several conversations spanning several days while I tried to collect my thoughts and pinpoint my exact feelings.\n\nAt the end of one of our conversations we determined that we have different perspectives of what quality time is for the each of us, mine being more intentional, and mentally present, without tv or phones, while coexisting is enough quality time for him. At the end of our last conversation, I told him that I am going to make more of an effort to create intentional time together since I know that will help me to feel more satisfied in our relationship, but I had asked him to make more of an effort to do this as well.\n\nSince then, I have made more of an effort, such as suggesting we eat dinner at the table instead of watching tv, or suggesting small activities like cooking, to do together. Since our convo I don’t think he has initiated any time like this, and during some casual activities would be on his phone.\n\nI’m getting frustrated and disappointed with his actions, but is there anything else I can do?

We’ve known each other for nearly 3 years and got to making things official. Things were going fine until we had a conversation abt potentially meeting up and sleeping together. It was then disclosed that I was a virgin and she was not. I frankly didn’t care as sex is a part of life. But it was then explained the time stamp in which it occurred. She had met with someone else a month before we confessed to each other. Which is still fine to me. There was in a sense no exclusivity or mutual feelings between us. But then it was clarified that even after our confession she continued said relationship for at least a month after. I know that we technically weren’t in a relationship but a sense of betrayal felt apparent. She had known this person for less than a week when everything went down and frankly it doesn’t align with what she said the importance of sex meant to her among other things she told me abt. She also said that she knew she liked me for much longer prior so even though I didn’t mention that I liked her she in a sense knew and still went. She held on to this information for 10-11 months before disclosing it with me. But at that she never even came to me abt it and more so I got it out of her. I’ve been trying to come to terms with it and I’ve no ill intent towards either of them but my trust feels it’s been shot down a good amount. There’s a lack in authenticity and consistency which I told her prior smth I valued a lot. She claims she regrets her actions which I respect and am grateful she came forward, but at the same time it feels she just pushed what we had to the side. I felt forgotten and almost like a second fiddle. And all I can think about is why? It hurts especially as I would work a lot and free up time to chat with her and all for her to talk back as if nothing was happening. She initially planned on telling me when we met in December. But that would have been after hundreds of dollars, time spent driving, and meeting of friends and family. I’m feeling hurt confused disappointed and so much more but I’m not mad at her.

Being lied to for a year really did a number on me and the continuation of such an action after feelings became expressed and mutual was even worse.

This is the summary of what happened in nearly 2 months... 2 weeks of everyday meetup, 3 weeks of long distance.\n\nWe first knew each other at a party, just staring at each other, and it hit me, I would like to talk to her, but I didn't have the courage to do so. After that, I just ignored my feelings. Then, 1 month later, with the help of my friends, we connected. She told me that she had a crush on me at that time. Since we were introduced via chat, we called each other for 5 days straight before we met personally.\n\nWhile talking, we became too intimate with each other. It was like we had known each other for many years. All the kinks we had, how high our drive was, it was like talking to a mirror, that's how alike we were. We talked like that for days.\n\nThen I picked her up at the station. Immediately, we held hands. In our meeting, we teased each other many times. We had just met, but it felt like we were the greatest couple out there. Somewhere in a café, I courted her properly because all I thought about was having a proper relationship and having her to myself.\n\nWe then saw each other every day for 1 week. At the end of the week, we had a study group at my house, and we were just close to each other, like we couldn’t be apart. At night, I accidentally looked at her phone because I thought she said something about still having photos of her ex. So, I searched her gallery just a tiny bit and stopped immediately. After that, I only put my fingerprint on her phone, then nothing else. We just cuddled until morning, and I thought it was nothing because maybe she would delete them anyway.\n\nAfter a few more days, we still saw each other every day until she said she needed a quiet place to study. I invited her to my house because it was only me and my grandmother day and night. We became so comfortable that something happened, she had a kink about being dominated, so I did. After a few days, the same thing happened again.\n\nEvery day felt perfect to me because it had been years since I felt something like that again. A true love, you could say, because it felt like looking in a mirror at myself. We understood each other that much... or so I thought.\n\nThen a problem arose. She had been held back for a year, so now she needed to study for 6 years instead of 5. She also had a habit of hurting herself with a razor on her shoulder. It was a past habit that came back, she had scars on both her legs, shoulders, a little bit on her chest, and a little on her back.\n\nNo, I did not support her doing that, at first, but my friend said maybe I should ignore it for now, and I did. She also said something like she didn’t want to change because it felt like being controled. So, I just comforted her. This was the only time I saw her like that. For a few days of her being negative, I comforted her every time, saying, *\"I'm there for you,\"* *\"I'm not going to leave you, I promise we're in this together.\"* I meant every word, that’s how serious I was about her.\n\nAt first, it wasn’t all about being intimate because I liked being physical, but it turned into something more serious love.\n\nWe were now on a break because she needed to go home, miles away like a 5-hour drive. After 1 week of being long distance, she suddenly said we should see each other less. She would decide when we were going to meet and call. She also said it was her fault for being too intimate, that we were acting like more than just a courting couple, and that we should be in a more ordinary courting stage.\n\nAfter all that, she suddenly messaged that we needed to slow down because she was feeling overwhelmed, like we were *more than lovers* (she had been thinking about this for a week, she said). The only thing I did was agree with her and respect her decision.\n\nAfter 1 week, we met for a day, and guess what we did? We only watched a movie beside each other with less touching. When we said goodbye, it was only a hug. But at the 1st two weeks mark, we kissed goodbye (see the difference?).\n\nThen it was long distance again. After 2 weeks, every day she became more distant. I ignored it and just messaged as usual, but every day she would say that she missed me. Then, during my family outing, I got a message: *\"I miss you,\"* she said.\n\nAfter that, I had another outing with friends for 1 week. At that time, she became even less chatty. She knew my friends (because some of them were also her friends), and most of us were in relationships, so there was nothing to worry about. After a few days of her being less chatty, she suddenly stopped messaging for nearly a whole day. Then, at night, she confessed through chat:\n\n\"I've been meaning to talk to you. I'm sure you noticed that I've been distant.  \nBut yeah, I want to stop this already.  \nIf I'm going to be honest, there are things in the relationship that gave me the ick, things I TRIED to tolerate but just couldn't.  \nI tried everything because I genuinely wanted to see what could happen between us.  \nIf this is the relationship I've long wished for and yes, it was, at first.\n\nWhen I said we should be physically distant from each other, I already told you that sometimes I think about ending things.  \nAnd that's the thing, since then I really have been trying.  \nThat's why I gave you a chance, that's why I said we should start over.\n\nBut I don't know.  \nThese kinds of thoughts just suddenly resurfaced.  \nAnd believe me, I really thought this through.  \nTo be truly honest, I've been feeling this way for like 3 weeks already.  \nBut like I said, I did try.  \nAnd this decision, I thought about it for a week too.\n\nAlso, there's been a lot happening in my personal life, as you can see from my notes most of the time.  \nSo yeah, I don't think I can handle anything right now.\n\nOne of the things that resurfaced for me was your actions regarding privacy  \nlike putting a password on my phone and accessing my photos.  \nMaybe because I let you do that when it happened, it's only now that I'm feeling the impact.\n\nAlso, there's been a lot happening in my personal life, as you can see from my notes most of the time.  \nSo yeah, I don't think I can handle anything now other than that.  \nMy mind is also a bit torn when it comes to my parents right now.\n\nI really am sorry.  \nI tried, so hard.  \nI gave myself so many chances.  \nI really wanted it to be you.  \nBut the longer it went on, the more I noticed that my feelings weren’t developing the way I thought they would.  \nI hope you understand.  \nI'll have to focus on myself for now.\"\n\nThat’s where it ended. I replied, saying I noticed her being distant, that I changed myself for her, and that she should give herself more chances. She replied that it wasn’t going to work anymore, that she was confused with herself and didn’t want me to experience that, and that I deserved to be happy and shouldn’t suffer because of her. I begged her to stay, but she dropped the bomb that it wasn’t a discussion, she just wanted to message me so I wouldn’t have to wait.\n\nThis is what I think: Did I become too controlling? After making that mistake with her privacy, I never brought up her past. We didn’t even do anything during those 3-4 weeks apart. It only feels like I was used.\n\nHere I am, thinking all sorts of things because I thought it was too perfect. After years of not being in a relationship, this is what happens to me. I already decided that she would be the one. I don’t think I’ll allow myself to go back into a relationship after this one.\n\nThe mistakes I think she had, She didn’t want to change. When she talked about her exes, it was like she was reminiscing about them. She self-harmed.\n\n(If you want to know more or have questions, please ask.

Wednesday came around she felt really bad about how reacted told me she’s sorry and didn’t mean to make me cry if I did cry at all and she took responsibility so did I and she said she’s happy we can talk again. Thursday she told me she’s still pretty sick and can’t talk because she’s sick I was like ok that’s fine I get it but I might’ve been little too spammy when I shouldn’t have been. Friday same thing didn’t talk at all she was still sick and than Saturday I asked if she wanted us to last forever and than she said yes she loves me and that she wants us to work out and last forever and I really want us to last forever too. Yesterday I asked her again and she said she starting to have doubts but she does want work on it. She been little off recently usually gets this way if she in pain or sick or if I get really annoying. I guess I been too spammy and way too annoying for her to handle and today I asked if she still loves me if we’re going be fine she got mad asking why do I keep asking that and she said I’m way to anxious all the time I need calm down as she said in the past she feels like she my therapist more than my girlfriend. I tell her I’m trying to change she said I say it but she doesn’t see it at all I tried asking her what does she want me to do so I know what to do to be a better boyfriend. She said stop asking her what I need to do I should know it by now. Then she said everything I’m doing is pissing her off than she snapped at me for being in a group chat with a dude who was very Nazi like and racist and Islamophobia I stayed for my other friends there but I did feel little strange being there. She called me a Nazi for that and was very upset at me asking her if she had Covid as she said I’m being racist to her because she’s Asian. She mad at me for voting more conservatively at one point in time I’m not really conservative anymore though. She told me she started to regret even being associated with the likes of me for the people I talk to. I wanted confront them she wouldn’t let me saying let them be them as that’s how they are.

This isn't my first relationship ever, but I definitely consider it my first serious relationship. We've always had a super strong bond and even on days that we spend time together when I'm not really feeling it, she and I always have a lot of fun with each other. We bounce off each other in both silly and serious ways extremely well, we both think about the future often, we both enjoy a lot of similar activities, and overall we seem to on the surface be a really good match for each other. Despite all of this however, I've really started thinking about splitting ways as of the past few months and I've come to no conclusion on my own. There are a lot of factors for me wanting this, but I suppose I'll just try to write them down in some natural order and let the thoughts pour out. Apologies if I write this story a little bit all over the place. :)\n\nFor one, as my senior year is closing up in HS (I'm a September baby so I'm older than most of my class) I cant help but feel like I'm missing out on something. Not necessarily other women, though I'd be lying if I said that wasn't a factor, I mostly just feel like the early adulthood single experience is a very important time in a lot of peoples lives. I know for certain there's a lot of growth to be had during this period of time, and a lot of connections that can be made with other people or memories made, and I can't help but feel like I'm holding myself back from all of this if I decide to stay with my current partner. I feel like I have no room to go anywhere or grow in any way, and whenever I'm with her I start to feel like I'm the same person I was when I met her, despite me knowing just how much I've still changed over this past year. It just makes me wonder.. if I feel held back now, what would that be like in 10, 20 years? I also feel like I shouldn't start out my adult life the exact same way it'll be when I die. I suppose in simpler terms, I feel stuck.\n\nAnother factor is that I feel like she is unintentionally extremely emotionally manipulative, and strangely enough I feel like it's only been amplified over time. My own theory is that her lack of a strong example of a good relationship in her parents possibly plays a role here, but I don't really know the reason. Either way, it feels really shitty. A great example is this last weekend. We've hung out basically every single Sunday since we got together, it sort of just became \"our day\". While I definitely enjoy this time with her, all she ever wants to do is sit and watch movies. Literally every single time, sit and watch movies. I've never really been a movie person. Of course I'll make compromises and do some things with her that she enjoys, but it seems like I never get to do anything that I enjoy (eg. outdoors stuff). Despite her claiming an interest in it, she always has an excuse to just sit and watch movies instead.. and it sucks. Wrapping back though, I feel like a good example of what I feel like is emotional manipulation is this last weekend. This last weekend I really just wasn't feeling it anymore, and in my own mind I think it's reasonable after over a year to maybe not spend every Sunday together, especially just watching movies, so I just politely told her how I wasn't really feeling it. She went totally ballistic, freaking out, and went to her same arguments of \"I miss you though!\" or \"well but I want to!\" etc. Eventually she pulled out the \"do you still love me?\" card, to which I basically politely told her that she was losing her lid and really needed to just try to understand where I was coming from. That's not the only example I have, and my friends have had some experiences with her in the past that I really don't like, but that's besides the point.\n\nBottom line is, I love her a lot, I really genuinely do. But, I feel like I'm strapped down to something that will only hold me back. I feel like I'm sort of \"trapped\", but I'm afraid of leaving because I both feel like I was lucky enough to get her, but I also know how much I love her and a lot of things about her and I know how painful all of it would be. I've had a few conversations where we ended up deciding to just \"work it out\", but I still find myself back here. I'm really not enjoying much of my time with her anymore, I can't even bring myself to read or answer texts half the time anymore, and I just feel like I owe it to myself to have a free adult life where I don't feel like I'm babysitting an adult 12 year old (as much as that sounds mean). It's a shitty spot to be in, and I agree with something my dad told me, which was \"if you're feeling this way about it now, it's probably not going to get any better if you wait until you move in together\". I also struggle because I don't want to be in a situation where my hypothetical future kid comes to me for relationship advice and I can't provide any because I've only really been in this one.\n\nAll of this really is extremely difficult to navigate, and I really could go into it in more depth and I might reply to comments and do that if I feel like it's necessary, but I feel like just having some advice tailored to my personal experience will probably help me to make a decision of some sort one way or the other. They'll at least be more helpful than reading posts of people with *similar enough* experiences, lol.\n\n**TLDR**; My GF and I have a seemingly good relationship, but I feel held back and don't know what to do.\n\nI know it'd hurt both me and her badly, especially with how close we've gotten, but I feel like I should focus on what I think is best for my life. I want to make it clear that there really isn't any ill feelings between us. And, as of right now, I feel like parting ways to focus on my own life and personal growth/experience is the best thing. It's tricky to navigate all of this, so I really would like some help.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

So I met this girl back in January through some mutual friends while we were out at a bar. At the time, she had just ended a two-year relationship a couple of weeks earlier. We hit it off right away. What started as something casual-mostly meeting up when were out partying and going home together-quickly grew into something more serious. We started dating, and although we never officially called each other boyfriend and girlfriend, our connection felt just as close. \n\nFrom January to June we spent a lot of time together- by the end, we were practically seeing each other every day. When summer came, she moved back home, about seven hours away, since she had finished her studies in my hometown for good. During those months together, I made it clear I wanted a relationship. She admitted she was interested, but also said she wasn't ready, afraid of being hurt like she was in her last relationship.\n\nEven after she moved home, we stayed in touch, talking for hours every day for about a month. We even planned a holiday together. But when I saw her again after that month apart, things felt different. She seemed distant, and after a couple of days she told me she still wasn't ready for a relationship. Still saying she still was afraid to get hurt which was- to be honest a bit weird to me, seeing I had done nothing, but trying to prove her otherwise. She literally said to me that her and her girl-friends talk about how perfect I treated her and that every girl should have one of me. Later that summer, she moved to Barcelona for a year to study with two of her girl-friends, and said long-distance wasn't something she could commit to. She still hoped I would visit, but I told her I couldn't justify the cost-and honestly, I was also worried about how look to others. People had already commented that it was strange I went on a holiday with someone I wasn't officially with, so I couldn't help but think about how it would come across if I spent hundreds of euros to visit her abroad.\n\nLooking back, I realize that probably pushed her away even more. After our trip, she messaged me saying she wanted \"as little contact as possible\" while she was in Barcelona. Now, a month and a half later, I regret what I said. I think I let other people's opinions influence me instead of listening to what I really wanted.\n\nSo now I'm torn: should I reach out and tell her how I feel (and maybe ask if she is down to have me come visit her), or accept that it's a lost cause?", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

During that move, I decided to do a software engineering bootcamp.\n\nIt’s been about a year since I’ve had a job, and I’m honestly so tired of being jobless. I gave software engineering a try, but I realized it’s not for me. On top of that, I have a lot of limiting beliefs:\n\t•\tI don’t have a bachelor’s degree in computer science\n\t•\tI’m a foreigner\n\t•\tTech is in a down cycle right now\n\nAll of this made it really hard for me, and eventually, I gave up on pursuing it.\n\nSo, we moved back to my home country and now I’m looking for work again.

He believes networking is the most important thing right now, but I really struggle with coffee chats. I don’t enjoy them, and because of that, I haven’t prioritized them. This frustrates him a lot, and we end up in big arguments. He feels like I’m not trying hard enough when I don’t follow the process the way he suggests.\n\nFrom my side, I am trying but when he breaks down my process, it makes me feel like I’m constantly falling short. Mentally, I’m not okay. I don’t feel like the same person he fell in love with, and I know this whole situation is tiring for him too.\n\nAnother big issue is that he has told me he doesn’t feel comfortable going into marriage with me right now because he feels I’m not consistent and he just feels like I’m not reliable and what if we have kids and i can’t pull my own weight like do research for schools etc . he’s brought up a prenup multiple times. I don’t mind signing it, but it really hurts me that things have gotten to this stage in our relationship because of my career struggles and the way I do things spills over \n\nMoney isn’t a huge issue since he’s financially stable, but I also don’t want to just sit around doing nothing.\n\nI guess my main question is: How do I navigate this dynamic without damaging our relationship? How do I balance his accountability system with my own way of doing things, when I feel so mentally drained? And how do I process the fact that my career struggles are now affecting our marriage discussions?\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR: Quit my job, moved abroad with fiancé, tried a software engineering bootcamp but gave up. Now back home, job hunting again, and fiancé wants me to network heavily (coffee chats, spreadsheets, etc.) while I feel drained and resistant. He’s also said he doesn’t feel comfortable marrying me right now because of my job search consistency and has brought up a prenup multiple times. I don’t mind signing, but it hurts me that it’s come to this.

We were drinking and at night while winding down he got very…. mean? and started saying we were done, muttering things under his breath and acting completely not like himself. It’s hard to describe but it was essentially drunk blubbering , we got into a huge argument and he just was not clear , not making sense and the next day he apologized said he drank to much and we moved on. i can go into more detail about this but i’ll leave it for the sake of this being a million miles long.\n\nnow every time he drinks too much the same EXACT thing happens. it seems that there is a direct correlation with him drinking to much and him going on a “we are done, what’s wrong with you, i hate you” tirade. it is so strange because this man is so sweet, so put together and seriously a GREAT guy. he’s an amazing friend, helps those around him, super smart and caring but it’s like he turns into a monster when he drinks too much. (NEVER physical) he gets arrogant, condescending, talks down on me the whole 9. \n\ni have vocalized this from instance #1 and he’s very dodgy with his relationship with alcohol. REWIND to the second time this happened. so at this point it happened once, we moved on, he is running a half marathon so we travel to it with friends as a bday trip for him and fo celebrate his run. i meet one of his closest friends and wife and we are having a great time, after his race , he wasn’t feeling great, didn’t eat and drank. i could see in his eyes and actions it was happening… in public , in front of them. he started to get rude, i went to the bathroom with his friends wife, she’s a bit under the influence( nothing alarming just normal) and in the bathroom tells me “hey i just wanted to let u know i can see you’re getting upset , he’s great but i wanted to let u know we actually don’t love it when he drinks, he’s an alcoholic and gets like this.” i was obviously taken aback and i told her i had no idea and told her there was a time where something weird happened but he didn’t mention having an issue, we had drank a few times together including instance #1. she then proceeded to ask me if i knew how his mom passed and she said she died of Cirrhosis and she was a heavy heavy heavy drinker.\n\ni thanked her for the information and i can tell that she wasn’t telling me out of any weird reason, they seem to really care about him and his friend split him from me that night , got him together and in bed and his friends had some convos with me and i could really see how much they care for him and even me just meeting me. Nothing malicious just concerned and getting me up to speed is how i took it.\n\nI never told on her to him, i never brought up his mom to him and i essentially tried to stop drinking with him but haven’t really been successful, he sees what im doing and questions me like “just bc these instances happened it’s bc i was worried about this or that” and always has an answer when i KNOW the answer is deeper. Bunches of things have come up that’ll save energy on but overall it hasn’t been to the point where i wanted to leave because i was trying to work it out and so was he. He knows that i think the drinking is a problem and i told him that if this happens again (its happened probably 4 or 5 times — i know now that im typing it sounds horrible) but i haven’t met his family and he hasn’t met my friends. \n\ni had a trip planned for many months to come to his city (where i was from before i moved) so we can have a big get together and host something at his house. this was yesterday and we had the most PERFECT day, laughs games , very light drinking from everyone, he actually had one drink and made it a point to be so, and it was amazing. at the end of the night my friends hung around a bit longer and i saw him having another drink but again i wasn’t paying attention to him for awhile. we went to bed and he was tearing up saying he wished i could meet his mom and we were talking about how good the day was.\n\nhe said he was going to get water and was downstairs for 30mins i heard noises i called out to him asking if he was ok he reiterated he was just “getting water” he comes back upstairs i smell that he drank something and already knew what was going to happen. i was already on the brink of 5 hours of sleep for work and he turned it into 2 hours. he laid down next to me cuddled up with me and said “hey we are done” i tried to ignore him but he kept waking me up, i moved rooms and he followed me just starting absolute nonsense. i told myself if anything came up on this trip pertaining to this id be done.\n\n\nnext morning i go downstairs and see he SLOPPILY opened a bottle of wine and drank HALF of it, cork everywhere and just a mess. i confronted him and decided i wasn’t going to dance around feelings. bc i always have bc i knew about his mom and didn’t want to hurt him. i told him that drinking was the issue and how would this change moving forward as he was apologetic and told me “everything is going so good im self sabotaging”. i told him that was BS and the one and only reason that happened is bc of the drinking. he’s being defensive and not trying to brush it off and blame it on deeper feelings.\n\ni have never ever dealt with this or anyone who’s had issues with alcohol, is this a situation where if he was sober it would be fine, i don’t want to judge him or lose him but i just don’t feel comfortable with it anymore. he’s met my daughter he’s great and i told him if things went good for a year after this point i would move back (live separately) so we can see how things go but. i just don’t feel comfortable entertaining that if this is happening. \n\nor is this clear cut i need to leave and he needs to work on this alone? it just sucks bc my last relationship was mentally and physically abusive so i feel like i don’t know what the meter is for bad because i had horrible … and i really just need some advice. sorry this was so long\n\ntl;dr boyfriend possibly hid his drinking issue and gets very mean and focused on our relationship after heavy drinking", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}
{"id": "u/Available_Orchid_428_1293", "user": "u/Available_Orchid_428", "text": "How can i save my failing 7 year relationship?\n\nHi this is gonna be a long one as im going trough a lot of the 7 year relationship. Im (27M) and my girlfriend is (29F) we've been together for over 7 years, and recently she broke up with me and has feelings dor someone else and it's all my fault. \n\nHere is the context and full story:\n\nWe met when we were very young, she came from a bad house and i came from a emotionaly stable house. As such when we met i was the emotional support she needed to get trough the hardest years of her life. I was very fit at the time, and very social but then Covid hit. At that time we lived together at my grandfathers house as it was a small house with 2 floors. I was employed at a steady job, a perfect entry level position with infinite chances to advance and the pay was good i also advance to a Level 2 position. She was studying law at the time and it was a very hard period for her, we both had so much potential and life was good and momentum was high. \n\nBut then i made my first mistake as we transitioned to working from home i became lazy, complacent, stopped working out, stopped wanting to advance in my carrier as i felt it was enough because i fell into the comfort zone. During that time she was finishing her studies getting a better job and fighting for all hell to break trough a corrupt system to build a career. For context she had a near perfect GPA. During all that i became lazyer and fatter i loved the idea that i could finaly play videogames that i couldn't play before it was everything i did. At some point near the end of Covid i realised what i had become i went from 76kg of near pure muscle to 96Kg od pure fat. During this entire time, she would beg me to start working out again to be more ambitious to finish my drivers license and i just scoffed at the advice. As she went up, i went down and i dragged her down with me. \n\nI eventually became disgusted with myself once reaching the 96kg mark, and started slowly implementing a better diet as i had years of prior knowledge. I finished an IFBB certification for a nutritionist to have even more success in my journey. And i acctually did it, i came back from obesity and that gave her hope that i would change. In some ways i did but i still wasn't interested in advancing my career or getting a drivers license. During this time we got a big chunk of money from a relative to buy an apartment for the two of us. This was before prices skyrocketed, i was picky and missed the opportunity and hoped that they would go down (i was a naive kid) the money sat and lost value for years while waiting for the prices to go down. The second floor house that we lived in was not a place to live or raise a family, it had roches, it was filthy, we tried to maintain a clean living space but it just wasn't possible. Soon we moved back in with my parents and that's when everything started going downhill. \n\nMy parents are loving and caring but they are lazy, sloppy and not ambitious, my dad would finish his job and just stare at the TV all day, my mom would spend countless hours arguing on facebook, they sort of coexist, they never leave the house and it's only clean when someone comes over which is never. The house would constantly smell of cat food and feces as my parents left the cat sand and food in the hallway. Needless to say i was like them in a sence and she finally saw that it was a problem with how i was raised no ambition was ever implanted into me, just mediocrity.\n\nShe was genuinely unhappy in the relationship but she forced herself to stay as she loves me deeply and saw my infinite potential. She would eventually pull me up and build me into the person that i am today. But that took a toll. She is also very shy. Not only that but as my folks were slobs she would never feel like she could comfortably use the bathroom or go to the kitchen to make something to eat, i would constantly have to close doors, bring her food and such. As a result of me being used to and enjoying a routine and her not feeling comfortable in my parents house, the spark faded even further. I would improve on one thing and give her hope, then slow down and she would have to pull me up. Again taking a toll on her, as she focused on bringing me up i honestly beleive thst slowed down her career. \n\nAs she was picky i let her always pick a place where we would go out simply as i didn't really care what the place was. When we would go to a vacation (traveling is very important to her) i let her choose as i didn't know much as i never traveled with my parents, again out of best intentions as i knew it happened once a year and i wanted her to enjoy. Those good intentions kind ofnspiraled into a sence of fear to choose something as i didn't want to disappoint. In the end my carelessness, cowardace, the routine way of life, her constantly pulling me up and my stubbornness led to the spark fading heavily and her feeling like she is the man in the relationship. You see as she comes from a bad home she always yearned for a stable, mature partner, she wanted to feel safe and protected but i wasn't that. She would constantly be afraid of our relationship ending up like my parents, never going out, sitting in seperate rooms, no love, just coexistence. I hated that my parents instilled in me and deeply rooted their bad habits and actively fought against them. It felt like fighting myslef and i despised myself for it. I would come back to my old ways sometimes, but as time went on that happened less and less, i was fighting it off. \n\nShe would of course get hit up by guys but she would shut them down as she loves me deeply. But the years of forcing herself to stay with me as she saw potential thst never got realised took a heavy toll, the spark was gone. She would lash out at the smallest things and then eat herself alive as that's not how she wants to behaive and she knew i didn't deserve that. The constant small fights would chip away until everything was gone. \n\nDuring the years i did fight off my bad habits i was making steady progress and that sense of hope is what kept her going. I would constantly fight off my fathers implanted bad habits and actively told her im not like that and she saw i was fighting it. The final nail in the coffin was when we went with her aunt to a spring, instead of spending time and having fun i spent most of the time on my phone, i was lazy, not interested in much, just relaxing with occasional walks. As that reminded her of my father all the fears came back. As we are at a family starting age, specially her, she couldn't find a way to trust me anymore. And that eventually manifested in her falling in love with someone else, someone that had all the qualities i lacked. She feels guilt and is conflicted about her feelings on one hand she has feelings for someone else, but yet she deeply loves me and just wanted to spend her life with me but couldn't trust that i was changing into what she needed\n\nWe had our final talk about trying to save our relationship 2 days ago during our trip to Greece. She couldn't trust me anymore that i could become the person she needs and we broke up.The irony in the entire story i did grow into the person she needs, hell im on the verge of being everything she needed.  Over the past 6 months alone I finally found and bought a home and a good one, im in the middle of getting my drivers license, 15 more practical classes and i can get the license, im actively studying and applying for better positions and am trying to climb the corporate ladder, i used my IFBB nutritionist certification to set everything up to start a private business on the side as soon as i move into my new home (my parents home is not a good place to set up a food based business as you might guess), im more attentive and take more responsibilities. As my grandfather unfortunately passed, i work near every weekend to renovate house so we can rent it out. Unfortunately my current schedule doesn't allow me to go more. I now have the hunger of ambition that she tried to wake up for years. But due to her previous experience with my fathers implanted bad habits she can't bring herself to trust me to become something when she fell in love with someone that can provide stability and safety, it would be a huge risk due to my past bad pattern of habits. I don't blame her, not in the slightest she has to put herself first after years of trying to make something out of me but god does it hurt. \n\nShe never wanted things to go this way, it ate her up that she had feelings for him when she loves me more than she loved anyone else. In the end she said she doesn't love him, she loves me, but she doesn't want to be with me in a romantic way with the person that i am now. I told her that i love her more than i love anyone else and that i cant expect her to wait for me, but that i will use these next few months to build myself into the person she needs and deserves i will build myself into someone who can make her feel safe and regain her trust trough actions not words and will come back for her. I don't want anyone else, the love that we built, the things we went trough together im not letting that slip away.\n\nNow with my entire lore out and about here come the questions:\n- While every long relationship is bound to end up in a routine in a sence, i hate that, i want to be more spontaneous as i was before, how can i reprogram my beain to do that?\n- What else can i do to show her i've changed once once I've completed all my goals or better yet how can i improve further?\n- How do i approach her again after i finish my goals for a second chance? \n\nPlease provide any ideas you have as it will mean a lot. \n\nI would like to point out we are still in Greece together im not gonna lie it's weird, but im focused on making fond memories with her and letting her enjoy her holiday, she needs it. \n\nIm definitely going to focus entirely on myself, my body, carrier, health, physical and mental and am going to see a psychologist for advice as well. I've already come far and will go even further. To confirm im not just doing this for her, i need to be better i want it more than ever, but damn me if i let the love of my life slip away.\n\nShe talked about our relationship with her family namely her aunt that witnessed me acting as my father on our trip, she also met him and was dumbfounded by how arrogant he is. I asked if she would be okay with me speaking to her and some of the other family members as they will be able to criticize me fully and i need that, i need to know what more i can improve. She smiled at the idea and gave me her number and blessing. \n\nIm not going back half baked, im giving it my all, the best version i can be for her. We are both rational and mature adults, we don't know if once i complete my goals, she will feel anything in a romantic way again. But everything that we've been trough is worth any struggle and even if norhing changes i will know i gave ir my all. I just hope that after all is said and done after we meet again she will feel the same way.\n\nTl:DR - my girlfriend is breaking up with me due to my previous lack of ambition and bad habits i picked up from my father, she needs to feel safe and secure as we are at a family starting age. I now am that person that can provide all of that, and very close to becoming even more but she can't trust words alone. Im going all out to win her back and need advice along the way.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We became official a couple of months after, and we've been off and on since. We're both located in the US.\n\n\nIt's safe to say that I genuinely love him. I consider him my first love, my first actual relationship (the others were just filled with toxicity), and the first person I could ever genuinely relate to. We both know each other almost in and out, and are both very understanding of one another and we love each other unconditionally. I've accepted him for his interests, and he's accepted me for mine.\n\n\nThe first problem? He cheated. Twice.\n\n\nHe confessed to cheating on December 1st, 2024. He said he's cheated since my birthday (June 28th, 2024, the day we officially started dating) by talking to other girls and dating them individually online. It took until almost June of this year to heal from that, and there's been mutual understanding from both sides. Complete transparency too, allowing each other access to accounts, etc.\n\n\nBut of course, it happened again. But this time, it was more hidden.\n\n\nWe were arguing and he decided to play a game. Soon after, he accidentally invited me and I saw him playing with and talking to another girl. After a few minutes of back and forth, he left, and I talked to the girl he was talking to. She claimed he was complimenting her constantly, saying, \"You're so nice and amazing\" and other things. Note that they had only known each other for 30 minutes, the girl also claimed. She also said that he said that all he deserved was bad things said to him.\n\n\nI personally took that as emotional cheating, and didn't realize it until months later.\n\n\nThere was me screaming and crying on call, long talks, etc, but we managed to get over that hill (somewhat).\n\n\nIt took him a while to realize, too.\n\n\nNow the second problem ? He thinks I've cheated\n\n\nI had a friend (I've now blocked out of respect of my boyfriend) I told my boyfriend about, we'll call him N. \n\nI had met N while me and my boyfriend had known each other earlier this year. Our friendship was okay. I never held any real interest towards him, which caused me to ignore him a lot, and yesterday (yes, it's 1 am as of me writing this) I decided to respond to him because I felt bad for ignoring him. I kept things simple and straight, until N interpreted something I said differently. I was finishing up talking to my boyfriend and I told N to hold on, I was almost done.\n\n\nHe interpreted that as me pleasuring.. myself..\n\nAnd I didn't encourage it or say anything inappropriate to him. I kept telling him to shut up and even threatened to beat him up (as a joke, but you know). What makes that even weirder is that he has a girlfriend, and made the excuse that friends should help their friends out. I even mentioned that to him and he played it off like it was nothing.\n\nBut anyway, I decided to tell my boyfriend as I tell him about every conversation I have with someone, and he gets upset and interprets that as cheating as I didn't tell him right away. He thought I was hiding it from him, and he also got upset that I texted N while he was working. He was also upset at how I didn't tell him N was texting me before.\n\nNote: i go on a ask and tell basis. If he were to ask me something, I would tell him the whole truth no matter what it is\n\n All of this happened in the same day, and I didn't tell him as soon as I stopped responding to N because my boyfriend was working, and I didn't want to stress him out while he was. He said that wasn't an excuse and I knew it wasn't, but that was my reason why. He's asleep right now and I can tell he's very hurt by the conversation we had hours prior to this being posted. \n\n\nI really don't know what to do. I love this guy with all of my heart, and it pains me that he thinks I cheated when I think it's just a communication issue from my side (which I told him). He said I could believe that it's not cheating, but he perceives it as cheating. I'm shaking at the thought of us not being together, because I love him, and I know deep down he loves me. Our relationship is perfect besides the cheating conflicts. He's sleeping right now, but I'm hoping to be able to talk to him soon.\n\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend thinks I cheated while I have conflicting views of it, and I'm afraid it's going to affect our future with how our relationship's past has been.\n\n\n Does anyone have any advice to give?

Drinks alone at home before I get there to go out, then 5 drinks when out. Sometimes the car swerves or goes over the shoulder. Anyhow it’s been a year and we see each other 3 days a week. Most Fridays he either has a “work happy hour or dinner” where SOs are “not invited” or is just “out w the guys” and the issue I have is he will totally disappear on all those nights, no text till afternoon the next day. Tried saying I’d appreciate if he could just text he made it home. Nope. One night he was out, I texted at like 10p that I had an awful work day, he claimed he was talking to his 5 year old nephew?? I said no prob call me when done. He totally disappeared, no call no text. Went to his apartment & car not there. Said in the AM I’d been worried. He said “I just went home and went to sleep.” I said “oh well your car wasn’t there” and suddenly the story change to he’d slept at his bro’s, which was total opposite direction from where he’d been out. Asked his buddy’s wife whom he’d gone out with if he’d crashed with them, she was like omg no and my hubby was home by 8pm. \n\nSo next weekend same thing, he’s going out and it’s “just the guys.” At midnight I text him “hey it’s a lot of nights you’ll just completely disappear till next day and I tried to express it’d be great to at least text you got home safe but never happens.” Over this he broke up with me, calling me “f*cking insecure” and a “psycho.”\n\nAnother time he said totally swamped w work, could meet me for a drink at the bar (all our dates are around alcohol & other people). Got there first, met a girl who just started dating my BF’s new friend from this bar. She casually says my BF was “at her house” earlier that day. Once he gets there I’m kinda asking him “so like I thought you were super busy w work but you were in that girl’s house?” He said “You’re talking to me like a b*tch. You’ve had a f*cking attitude since I walked in.” Said he didn’t know her man wasn’t in the house, only came in to see the renos done since she lives in his neighborhood and we were only alone there for 5 minutes!\n\nAny time I’ve brought up how I don’t love the disappearing overnight + not even disclosing where he’s going, or simply asked “what’s up w this girl saying you were at her house?”, he immediately goes into attack mode, telling me I “need a shrink” or if I get teary eyed “boo hoo aren’t you always the victim?!!” like a super angry reaction and says he’s “sensitive to criticism”\n\nWhen we meet to talk, I’m thinking about telling him I don’t ask for a text that he got home to be “f*cking insecure,” but rather bc he always has 5 liquor drinks while out & I’ve witnessed him swerve the car or hit the shoulder a lot .

I really thought I liked him but I always struggle to tell the difference between romantic and platonic feelings, so I think thats what happened again. I tried to get those feelings back but it just makes me regret it more and more. He's done nothing wrong, he's an amazing guy, but I just don't like him.\n\nI planned to break up with him this upcoming Sunday since he would have 3 days off from work, so I thought it'd be perfect so he could have time to process it and relax. But recently his workplace has been getting more toxic since his managers are racist and make fun of him because of his adhd. And then a few days ago they called him in for a meeting and told him they were replacing him from someone in another store. I think they're just going to be switching places but the managers at the new place are also racist.\n\nI know I need to break up with him before the relationship goes on any longer but I feel so horrible and I don't want him to get more depressed than he already is with life. His family is horrible to him and his self-esteem is nonexistent, plus he never talks to anyone else because he says he's not social. When we first became friends, I had to put in so much effort since he's so afraid of being himself. Last week, I tried to help him become friends with someone that he already somewhat knew, but he just stayed quiet the whole time.

Personally I feel if you are dealing with someone who has cheated in the past then trust your gut. In my case with my LTR of a year and a half, she turned out to be a bit of a serial cheater, both physical and emotional.  My gut always told me something was off despite the denials and pledges of love, future marriage etc. She had cheated before and the signs were always there again. I stuck around because she was going through an unrelated difficult personal situation and I wanted to support her. The red flags were always there. Not wanting to see me too often, phone blowing up from “friends” while I was there, going through the motions in the bedroom or not interested at all, working late or bed early etc.  Then she started changing her hair, losing weight, using new phrases during text etc., the usual signs. It was about a week after one visit the I had to see a doctor for a plumbing issue. Proof positive of cheating. Thank goodness it was treatable and the battery of additional tests came back negative. When I addressed this it was met with DARVO. (She has textbook covert narcissist traits, which might help explain all this) Due to her “gift” I felt compelled to dig deeper in my suspicions.  I did the usual on the people finder search sites. Found some stuff. Additional phone numbers, email addresses, generic social media. I knew for a fact there was more. I’ve seen it. I enlisted a professional service. Actually a friend of mine who does that for a living. He told me flatly that anything you send online or electronically stays out there and can be found not matter what any app says, if you delete it, the dm, message, pic or video disappears or can’t be screened shot. So consider that when communicating.  He found much more than I was prepared for. Messages, pics., videos, profiles, etc.  I was shocked and saddened. Not the vindication I wanted but what I suspected. I even used one of the user names from a site to locate a comment where she shared her recent Tinder experience. It was a week after our last visit. I’m not shaming, blaming, exposing or calling out. Just sharing my experience. Sorry for the long story and letting me vent.  I got off track. At the end of the day the blame for my situation is on my shoulders. I knew her history and saw all the subtle and obvious signs. Not angry and no animosity. I’m an fool but if I can help anyone avoid the same mistakes I made, then it is worth being an idiot. I guess what I’m trying to say is, Once a Cheater Always a Cheater? Not always but in my case, yes 100%.  Also trust your gut. It is right most of the time.

This is truly incredibly hard for me to deal with, we’ve met up in person numerous times now and have stayed at each others houses for weeks. What makes this hardest is she has the sweetest family who struggle with money a bit, and a few flights until January next year have been booked already, as well as my own. She was with this person before I came into her life, not long before but before. They weren’t “official” but still said they loved each other, still kissed and still went to eachother families. I saw texts about the way she’d lie to me about being out with friends when she was with him. I just feel so hurt she played me like that when she was the sweetest girl ever to me. How could my baby do that? She’s worked so hard to be better for our relationship. She did break things off with everyone to focus on me but that never should’ve happened in the first place. I really do want to love her. But I hate her so much for what she’s done to me. I know a lot of people tend to pull the “you’re young, break up” but throughout my life I never even wanted a relationship. She’s the only person I’ve dated because I’ve refused to date anyone else despite the chances. The way it is when we’re together is so magical. I just can’t believe she even had the capacity to wrong me so horribly. It feels like the sweet girl I knew doesn’t exist, she takes full accountability and responsibility for her actions and doesn’t try justify them. She’s been working to help me and she’s being getting relationship therapy with a councillor. I really do want this to work. But I don’t know how to go moving forward. I was doing okay, I found this out a while ago and recently I had sort of come to terms with it despite obviously being absolutely devastated, but last night I just completely broke down. I told her this morning I don’t want to speak to her for a few days because of what she’s done, and the fact I have exams. Please, please give me genuine advice and how I can move FORWARD.

{"id": "u/Grouchy-Chest262_828", "user": "u/Grouchy-Chest262", "text": "How can I fix potential calamity between MIL (73F) and I, 39F\n\nMy '39 F' fiance '39 M' and I have been together for 2 years as of October 1st. However, I was friends with his sister back in highschool so we have technically known each other and I have known his family since I was a young teen. I only went over his house when I was younger though, so it's not like I've had a consistent relationship with any of them since then. \n\nSince my fiance's father died, his mother moved in with his sister and her husband for years and then when her sister divorced her husband and abandoned him and all of their kids for another man about 2 years ago, their mom moved in with my fiance's brother. Starting about two weeks ago, his mom and brother are not getting along so she moved in with us.\n\nI was perfectly happy about this at first. Im currently out of work and get lonely sometimes while my guy is at work so the company sounded quite nice, especially considering I thought his mom (73F) and I always seemed to get along so well when we would have them over for dinner. After a week of her moving in though, things between she and I have been spiraling...FAST! And I'm emotional AF about it! (But I'm also pmsing and have always suffered badly during this time emotionally and physically so I could be easily \"my own worst enemy\" at this time, as my SO likes to say.\n\nFor background context: My guy has always been her least favorite kid, according to him. She cherishes her oldest son who she pays for everything (rent, bills, groceries, Uber rides, etc.) for and has been doing so for many years while he chooses not to work. He couldn't take her anymore because he started using crack and was paranoid about her following him around all the time which is why he called his brother (my SO) to ask if she can stay with us. My SO is the only kid she would beat and abuse when they were younger, to the point that his dad took him under his wing and they bonded very strongly as his dad felt very bad about it but always loved his wife too much to leave her for it. After his dad died, she resented my SO even more as (in his mind, he looks just like his dad and reminds her of him?)\n\nAnyway, she had no interest in even inviting him (my so) to holidays until about the time he cleaned up his act (he was in and out of jail for a while but started going to church 3 years ago, got a great job, went from homeless, to riding a bike 40 minutes to and from work in all sorts of weather up until we started dating and he just got a car, apartment and now, as of last year we moved into our house) and suddenly asked to come over where we would frequently host her and his brother for dinner, cookouts and holidays. Before he got his act together, he never really heard from them not even to invite him to holiday dinners. Might be understandable to some, but she had zero issue with her two other kids while they were spiraling into drugs and other issues.\n\nNow, after her first few days of moving in were super great, it started one night when my SO and I got into a minor argument because when he came home from work, after he and I getting along amazing since his 2 hours of being home, he went out to the living room to talk with his mom and came back in our bedroom asking if something was w-rong with me \"today\" that day. It threw me off bc what would make him think I wasn't ok until he spoke to his mom? While he was at work I literally could not have been kinder to her, asking if she would like me to make her breakfast, lunch, chatting with her while also giving her space to get comfortable..anyway we didn't blow up on each other but she got insecure bc she heard is bicker and asked if she \"did anything w-rong?\" Which no, she did not, she just overheard him ask if I'm ok and I said \"why would I not be, we sat here getting along great since you have been home, why suddenly ask me if I've been alright today\".\n\nNo big deal. The next day, my SO was in the living room with his mom while I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette. I noticed our neighbors were having a party so I (admit, excitedly) went towards the living room saying \"the neighbors are having a party in case anyone wants to sit on the back deck enjoy the music and also, MIL, if it's a little loud tonight now you know why\" and I saw in the reflection of our dining room mirror, she looked at her son, threw her hands up and gave a nasty look as to say \"yea? Ok?And?\" And she looked mad as hell so I literally just sat outside by myself thinking wtf. My SO came out and we talked about that and even he said, \"so what you tried to be nice now if she can't sleep all night bc of the noise oh well\" and he suddenly got a text from his mom saying \"goodnight 😉\"...to my embarrassment I realized she was in her bedroom with the window open and had heard us talking about it on the back deck. And is it me or was that a weird ass text, they never say goodnight, I love you, nothing other than goodbye when they part ways.\n\nToday, she and I got along fine while my SO was at work. We even drove to his job together to drop off the lunch I made for him that he forgot to bring. He gets home, I go in my room, they are bickering about her other son in the living room, so I stay in my room to mind my business. She even said,\"what? You're gunna start arguing with ME now?\". When I thought the coast was clear for me to go in my own kitchen as I was hungry, wanted to grab a snack and they finally got quiet so I thought they were done arguing. Well as I walk in the dining room, she hears me coming and again, I can see her in the reflection roll her eyes and lets out a sarcastic \"haha\" sound. So when my SO and I were back in our bedroom and he heard the microwave go off for my snack he said oh ur food is done, I stupidly, sarcastically said \"well are you sure it's ok I go and get it?\" Which his mom heard me say and he got upset with me asking wth I was talking about and I said I'll tell you in a minute, go grab my food, as she hears me say I'll tell you in a minute she said \"oh God\" and when I went back to the room, shut the door, he was livid at me and demanded to know what I was talking about so I told him and he said \"she wasn't rolling her eyes at you, you always take things personally when it's not towards you\"....I admit, I sometimes do. \n\nWhich is why I am here....please, I am very self aware enough to know I sound like I am making a massive deal out of what could literally be MY own insecurity and have nothing to do with MIL. But if I'm stepping \"outside my mind\", my gut is telling me she and I are both being in a weird way insecure and idk...competing in some way while her son is home? Bc we are fine, zero tension when he is not here..Or is it just ME? Compared to most MIL stories I know this is nothing really at all...but I fear it is the START of at worst case scenario, the downfall of my relationship with my fiance.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I just wanted to share something and maybe get some advice. I’ve never had a conversation with a foreigner before. I’ve only ever chatted with two people online and both were Filipino. So when someone messaged me from Malta (he’s 25 and I’m 18), I didn’t really pay much attention at first. I didn’t take it seriously because I know things like that usually don’t last, especially when it’s online and long distance.\n\nBut we’ve been talking for over a month now and honestly that’s already a first for me. What’s strange is that he’s incredibly kind. It almost feels too good to be true. It’s like he came straight out of a book with the way he thinks and expresses himself. I know it’s the bare minimum but I’m also aware how rare it is to find a guy like him. His opinions amaze me and he never hesitates to sincerely apologize when he knows he’s wrong. He’s expressive, very vocal about his feelings for me, but he didn’t say “I love you” too early. He said it’s something sacred and he wants our connection to grow deeper before saying it. He’s never disrespected me, never brought up any sexual topics, and never asked for selfies. He already knows what I look like since we met on Instagram.\n\nOne time he asked if we could do a video call but I said no because I’m really uncomfortable with that, even with people I know. He respected it and never brought it up again. He sends voice notes, gives updates through videos, and when I asked about his past, he said he only had one ex and that relationship was also long distance so they never met in person.\n\nHe’s really kind, sincere, and consistent. But even with all that I know I shouldn’t fully trust someone I only met online. The thing is, I’m getting attached. The longer we talk, the harder it is to let go. He even said he’s willing to come here after he graduates which is in one to two years, and that he wants to introduce me to his parents someday if I’m open to it.\n\nSo now I feel stuck. I don’t know if I should continue this or stop before it gets any deeper. Sometimes I feel like I’m the one becoming the red flag because I overthink a lot and have emotional moments that I’m not sure he deserves to deal with.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

For the most part they have been happy and we’ve got on really well.)\n\nThank you to everyone who commented. We had a few chats in the week after the original post about the situation. I explained how her going behind my back plus dwelling on this past relationship made me feel.\n\nShe had said if I didn't want her to speak to him anymore, she wouldn't - I was adamant that this wasn't my call to make. She eventually said that she wouldn't speak to him anymore and that she was naïve to think that her and her ex could still be friends. As far as I was aware, she let him know that she wouldn't be in contact anymore because of me and he was accepting of this (I haven't seen any of their messages nor have I asked to).\n\nA week later my mother passed away so a pin was stuck in any conversations between us but about a week ago we had a good chat in which I felt heard, mostly centring around me creating a larger social life outside the home and how we've become co-dependent on each other. I said that my trust in her has been eroded which upset her a little but she understood. We seemed to be getting back on track and I was open about my insecurities, and what I needed to work on.\n\nUnfortunately a few days later, she seemed distracted and when I asked her what was wrong, she said she'd tell me later when the kids are in bed. This was dragged out all day and then she admitted that she was still in contact with her ex for a couple of weeks and wants to meet him for coffee. I asked what would happen if he made a move, and she said she'd be \"disappointed\". I also asked about his wife, and apparently he's separated (which she knew about before but didn't tell me). He's embarking on a new career and was asking her for advice, to which I questioned was there not anyone else in his life that could provide career advice. She also says he's had a cancer scare which also prompted her to get in touch with him again.\n\nIt's her call who she meets up with but I told her the lying has to stop. She claims it's so she doesn't hurt me but it's caused more damage by lying. She admitted that making me decide about her not talking to him anymore was \"poor\" but that I don't understand the depth of feeling that existed between them.\n\nI don't know what to say to her and have started investigating what steps to take legally to protect myself. I'm so angry and sad, that at best, she is sacrificing a 15-year marriage to be friends with an ex she hasn't seen in 20 years, and at worst, will get back with him.

They have abused and controlled me my whole life. Now I have a boyfriend of 2 years which is definitely not allowed by them. We’re “medium distance” as in he’s an hour away in a different state and I’m only able to see him once a month. My family recently found out about us and they just found some pictures I have of us on my instagram. I didn’t have my name on there and blocked mostly everyone thinking these old fucks wouldn’t know how to find me. I just went private and blocked the one aunt who found it. My youngest aunt and uncle who are evil incarnate, sent the pictures to my mom and threatened to send them to my dad who is the real issue. My mom is on my side but she’s afraid they’ll threaten to kick me out, expose me to everyone we know in the muslim community, and potentially ruin my sister’s lives since they’ll be ostracized. My mom’s idea is that me and my boyfriend should do a nikah  (islamic marriage) so my family can’t, by islamic rules, threaten and harass me anymore.  Even if they continue to do so it gives my mom the right to defend me.\n\nNow the part that I’m worried about is my relationship. I talked to my boyfriend about everything that happened and proposed that we comply with my family and do a nikah to get them off my back. Nothing legal, just the dumb fucking religious papers. Deep down I really don’t want to but I’d rather we do that and have a peace of mind. It would basically stop everyone from threatening me. Now my boyfriend doesn’t like this idea. He’d rather we just not see each other until I’m able to get a car. That could take up to a year. I would actually rather die than not see him for what could be a year. I said that since I’m starting a new job soon I can lie and say I’m going to work and then see him on the weekends. What should we do? I don’t want this ruining my relationship. We love each other very much and my boyfriend reassured me that he doesn’t want to leave me even though it could be difficult to see each other. I’d be extremely depressed as I have bpd and my brain makes me feel like I can’t live without my boyfriend. It also makes me feel like he’d abandon me if he can’t see me often.

Everything has been great but there is this one problem or two I guess. But just a little bit of summary, the way that I have been brought up its not okay for us to drink or smoke often. I have seen my dad and mom drinking but it's very rarely like about once in 3 months or so. Now my boyfriend since he moved out of his house to college he has been drinking very regularly, it started with drinking once a month to now drinking every weekend. \n\nNow it's been two years, he has completed his college and now is working but the pattern still is going on. We've had multiple fights over it and we always try to come to a middle ground of he shouldn't drink more than once or twice a month but he never follows through. Also one other issue is, we've been in a long distance relationship for 3.5 years now and since he started working (since last 6 months) our fight have increased. The other reason for our fight is I feel he doesn't give me enough time. So we both are working individual and also are in different time zones. I do not have a lot of life or friends or actually I DON'T have any life or friends at all where I live so he's my only source of support and my only friendship that I have. \n\nNow as I mentioned we both work so we only get weekends to ourselves to talk but he chooses to be with his friends during all the weekends. The first month of his job was hell for us because he kept going out with his friends and drinking every weekend and we kept fighting. Then he had to go to another city for training for the coming 4 months and that's when we got to spend time with each other every weekend, I was always there for him and everything. Our relationship was really good. Drinking didn't go down though it was the same (but that wasn't his fault I guess) but he had stopped smoking completely.\n\nAnyways. So those 4 months were great but now he's back in the city where he has his friends and now it's back to the routine so I spend my weekends waiting for him to get free and then we talk. He does come eventually after all his plans are over and might cancel one or two plans of his so we sit together but it's rare so I know that it's not like he isn't trying at all. Plus I do understand that he's living away from home and weekends are the only time he gets to chill with his friends and all so I understand that I can't expect him to lock himself in a room and spend his weekend evenings with me but I dont know. Also the smoking and drinking has again become regular. We have had MULTIPLE fights, mature talks and everything about all of it and each of it has ended with a truce of him understanding where I am coming from and that he will change. His issue is he doesn't want someone to control his actions and he gets triggered by that. \n\nSo now we are moving closer to getting engaged and getting our families involved and it's worrying me as to is this what my life is gonna look like? \n\nHe's the most kindest the most loving the most attentive person. Whenever we're together he treats me like a princess and I know he's loves me a lot. I don't doubt that for a bit. He always supports me he always is there to pick me up when I fall he knows what makes me laugh he always motivates me he takes care of me more than my parents does. So all of that is great.\n\nBut these issues keep coming up and am tired. As I said I don't have any friends I can talk about it too and I don't want to involve my brother into this cause like I said we are soon to get engaged and I don't want him to have a bad impression of him.\n\nI haven't used reddit much but I am looking for any kind of advice or perspective or anything that worked out for someone who went through this.\n\nThank you.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

He shared moments with me that he had with his daughter. (Yes, he has a daughter at 23, and he and the mom separated. Maybe a second red flag?) I felt like he kind of became part of my life and I his. We played League of Legends together. We sent each other TikToks. It was great.\n\nSo, fast forwarding to August, he got a job at a factory. We were so happy. We already planned our first date and everything, now that he would get a paycheck in September. We agreed to go to a big city which is halfway for both of us. We also agreed to rent a room (red flag number #3?) and sleep together. No sex, as I made it clear that I won't be having sex with him on our first date (I am a virgin, so a little scared haha). He was fine with it. He said he just wants to cuddle me.\n\nFast forward to September. He got his paycheck, but the planning spirit kinda died down. I always felt that whenever I asked him about his work schedule, he was bothered. He always said that he would look at it later (red flag #4?). So I didn't push it, but I was so impatient. I started dreaming about him even.\n\nSo, last week we didn't talk much. He later told me that he picked up an extra shift at work. He works 2x12-hour shifts and then has a day of rest. So he worked Monday, Tuesday, got home at 6 a.m. Wednesday, and then went to work again Thursday 6 p.m. and Friday. We last exchanged words (I can't really call it talking; it was really a quick exchange) Thursday. So I waited patiently while still sending pictures of stuff, the funny things that happened that day, etc., to him on Facebook Messenger. Three days have passed and I am still left on delivered as I am writing.\n\nToday (Sunday) I was getting a little worried, so I sent \"Everything alright?\" I didn't get an answer yet. I'm kind of sad. Now, we went a few days before without talking, but never like this. Whenever we didn't talk, neither of us texted, but now I am left on delivered for 3 days. So I started digging. He was online on Facebook Messenger countless times since. He also saw the last TikTok I sent on Friday, and he reposted a video on Friday as well. Next, I opened the dating app we met on, as I kept the app and my profile, but turned it incognito, as I was focused on this guy. And maybe, just maybe, I have looked at his profile on it sometimes to see if he was online, which he was a lot actually lol. (Red flag #5) Which reminds me that his phone died a couple of weeks ago. So I was happy seeing that he was online 7+ days ago. Sadly, after he got a new one, he became quite active on it again, but I couldn't tell him to quit because we are not a couple yet—or at least that was my thought process.\n\nSo here we are. I hope I can talk to him, but honestly, I am losing hope with every passing minute. I feel like three days is more than enough for someone to text a \"I won’t be available for a few days, sorry\" or something along those lines. And when I see the whole picture, I feel kind of ignored. Am I overreacting? I kinda made my peace with him, so if he doesn't turn up soon, I am leaving. Thank you for reading all this.

After our first year in Europe he went back home to get his drivers license ( I stayed in Europe) so he also went back to our high school where he saw some friends. There was a party at the school with people from our school and other schools from different cities. He went to the party.

Me the anxious, him the avoidant. The first 2 years of our relationship everything was felt like a movie. Around 3 years ago I realized how toxic some of the things I did and said were so I got help and really worked on it. Meanwhile he stayed the same. I have largely raised his daughter (staying home with her for years at a time). I have become financially dependent on him. I have always paid my own bills (car, insurance, etc). One day after another fight I decided to back a bag and go to my sisters because I couldn’t take another fight of gaslighting and nothing getting resolved then being blamed for “bringing things up before bed”. \n\nI left for a two weeks to give us both time to think. In that time I reflected and wrote down all the things I did wrong and took accountability. I wrote down what I would need to move forward. Meanwhile he took the time as a vacation. When I told him I was sad he hadn’t reached out at all he told me he didn’t need drama. Fast forward to our conversation face to face I told him I couldn’t continue if therapy was not involved. He told me he needed more time to think. At this point I have been gone for a month and we have seen eachother a total of two times both times he rescheduled. One of those times he told me I couldn’t handle being his fiancé…I’m too emotional, too needy. He also spent the entire time criticizing me and not apologizing for anything in the relationship. \n\nI told him it was best to part ways and he asked for more time to think and said he couldn’t tell if this was the worst mistake or the best thing for both of us. I kept saying it was clear he didn’t want to be together by everything he said, but still he is “unsure” of what to do. Still considering his daughter and being in love with him I told him to take a bit more time.

We were involved from August 2020 to June 2021, and then texted briefly in April 2022. He texted me again in July 2022 but I didn't reply until May 2025, and he replied to my text within 30 minutes asking, \"When and where can I see you?\"\n\nOur problem has always been that I'm soft, warm, and affectionate, and I fell in love with him fast and hard, and he's what I would call avoidant and a bit insecure. He admitted that in 2020, he resented how much I loved him, because he hated himself. We were never official so I knew he was involved with other women, specifically one woman, and he chose to date her because she was assertive, bossy, didn't think very highly of him, and he preferred that to my shy nature and tendency to smile at him with hearts in my eyes.\n\nSince reconnecting this year, he's seemed a lot warmer and more eager to open up to me. He says he doesn't want a relationship right now and sometimes feels like he is betraying his ex (the one who chose over me, who he broke up with in May 2024). When they broke up, she told him, \"Don't get back together with peonyprincessy.\"\n\nI asked him if he's told his friends I\"m back in his life. They're all aware of the love triangle drama. He said he did tell them, and that one of his friends asked, \"Well, what's she like?!\" and my situationship compared me to that friend's girlfriend, who is adored by the entire friend group for her sweet nature and kind heart. His friend lit up and said, \"Well I love my gf, she's my favorite person, so I'm sure I'll like peonyprincessy!\"\n\nThis was on the evening that he was waiting to see if he and his friends could come to my friend's rooftop party. My friend ultimately said no due to lack of space and lack of advance notice. My siutationship understood. Before my friend said no, my situationship told me he wouldn't be able to spend a lot of time with me and hoped we would attend the party as friends. \n\nHe's very hot and cold. One day he tells me he can't get enough of me in bed, and the next he asks if we can just be friends who cuddle but don't have sex because I'm \"too good to be objectified.\" Then a few weeks later, admitted he thought if would be easier if we stopped having sex so that it wouldn't feel disrespectful if he hit on women in front of me at parties. One day he's cuddling me and stroking my hair when I cry into his neck, and the next he's telling me about the other FWBs he has on rotation. One day the sex is intimate and there's lots of eye contact and he wants to stay in positions where he can see me, and the next he's saying we aren't sexually compatible (despite him coming quickly on accident).\n\nRecently he tickled me and blew raspberries on my belly. We cuddled on the couch and read his favorite manga together. He drove me to the train and panicked saying it was the last one, I had to go. Then he called me and said he was driving beside my train and I could actually get off at the next stop if I wanted him to pick me up to extend our time together. So I did.\n\nBut then recently he was visiting and I noticed a girl's name pop up on his texts. I saw her name pop up a few weeks prior, when he had chosen to spend an entire weekend with me, and he told her he was busy. Well, this time, I asked about her and he admitted he had been texting us both the night before asking us both if he could stay over. She eventually went to bed since he took too long to visit, so he came to me. I asked who he asked first, and he admitted he asked her first, only because the last several times he had sex were all with me and he wanted \"variety.\"\n\nThis hurt me deeply but I pretended it didn't. We made love the second he got to my place, and I put a pillow under his head when he passed out from all the drinking he'd done before arriving, and when we woke up, we cuddled and I kissed him all over and said I was so happy he was there. I bought pedialyte for him. We cuddled on the couch and watched a show.\n\nWe take pictures in photo booths together, kissing like we're a couple. But then he asks me not to post them anywhere (not like I would). A few weeks ago he said he still misses his ex but he hasn't brought her up to me in a while now. I can tell she's on his mind sometimes though.\n\nDoes this man love me and not even know it yet? Is he in denial?\n\nTL;DR: I've been in an on-again, off-again situationship with a man I’ve known since 2020. We briefly dated, then reconnected this year after his breakup with someone he chose over me. He says he doesn’t want a relationship, but we've become physically and emotionally close again. His behavior is inconsistent. He's affectionate one day, distant the next. He’s open about seeing other women but still seeks out time and intimacy with me. I'm feeling confused about his intentions and unsure if I’m misreading the situation or getting too emotionally invested in something casual.

Im also learning now that Im in a space with a lot more of it that im afraid of consuming it and hanging around people who do to an extent that may be irrational, which is something im trying to work on.\n\nwhen my boyfriends first weekend came up, him and a bunch of new friends he had found a way to get some alcohol from one of their parents, which was already unnerving to me so i spoke to him about it. i told him it made me nervous and he told me that he would not drink that much when he went to a frat party that his friends planned on going to later. that whole night i was very anxious, and because of my overthinking. when he got in touch with me next hours later, he was much more drunk than either of us had anticipated. and because i was overthinking, anxious and checking his location, i ended up accusing him of cheating the next day, which i was totally wrong for. we talked about it for a long time today, and a main point we talked about was that the sudden alcohol use kinda threw me for a loop and i didn't know what to expect, so when i saw him at a location that was not the frat's chapter house, i let my anxiety get the best of me. i told him that the alcohol use also does just generally scare me, but that i did not want to keep him from having fun, and i wanted him to do what he wants and to enjoy college.\n\nlater tonight, he had what i thought was a formal fundraiser event because of what he told me about the dress code, turns out the fundraiser was just a cover charge to a party with a formal dress code (total accidental miscommunication -- no ones fault). he and his friends all pre-gamed or post-gamed the party and he texted me late tonight he said that he had too much to drink and had to rely on his friends to get back to his dorm. which frankly scared me half to death. as he told me about the rest of the night i tried to be supportive of his choices and be kind, but i did tell him it was still an adjustment.\n\ni just feel so lost and confused and worried. i never expected him to go this hard into it when he got to college and its scary to me because of how ive seen it tear apart my family. ive ended up feeling less close to my friends whove started drinking and im worried its going to drive a wedge between us like it did for me and those other friends. im planning on going to counseling about my worries regarding alcohol to help me work through it because i dont want him to feel like he cant do what he wants because of me. im worried that i wont be able to sustain a long term relationship with someone who drinks that much, and im also worried that i when i plan on flying out to see him that im going to either prevent him from going to parties he wants to go to or that im going to be dragged to one and be in that environemnt which im scared of.\n\nit feels as if i have arachnophobia, and that he just bought a pet turantula and joined a spider lovers group. i want to support what he wants to do, but the thing itself scares the snot out of me.\n\nThank you so much for any advice\n\nTL:DR - my boyfriends sudden increase in alcohol use in college and my trauma and fears relating to my loved ones drinking are causing a lot of problems for me.\n\nEDIT: i shouldve added that he said that hes going to ramp it down as classes start this tuesday, but its not because of my fears that hes going to do it but to focus on schoolwork (i did tell him that i did not want my worried to prevent him from doing what he wants). for that reason i am worried that i'll still be experiencing the same anxiety on weekends when him and his friends will most likely still be going out.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/aMFingINTP_1795", "user": "u/aMFingINTP", "text": "I (37m) keep feeling neglected by my partner (29f) and it's starting to get to me.\n\nI'm a 37 year old autistic. I was diagnosed level 1 (\"closer to level 2 than being not autistic at all\") which means that I struggle with a lot of miscommunication between me and others. I've gotten used to this. I also have depression and ADHD, but these impact my life much less. I'm employed full-time (I switch jobs several times a year and it can be difficult for me to remain employed, but I always pay my rent), working tech support overnight for public safety agencies (hospitals, fire departments, 911 dispatchers, etc.).\n\nMy therapist has suggested that I have something called Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is apparently an autism profile characterized by flashes of upset/anger when perceiving demands/tasks. So when someone asks me to do something, I tend to get immediately upset for ten or so seconds, but then it subsides. I've gotten used to saying yes, or 'I love you' as a response because I don't want my irritation to prevent me from doing things or being good to the people around me. The other theory is, since I have severe idiopathic hypersomnia (basically narcolepsy), that I might get flashes of frustration because I'm always so tired. It's difficult to say.\n\nMy partner is 29 and is in her fourth year of med school to become a doctor. She has very symptomic ADHD that may or may not be causing a rift that I don't know how to work with. She also has POTS and some kind of connective tissue problem that means her joints are constantly in pain. The only real relief is a massage, but she can't do a lot of it herself because it'll hurt her wrist joint. Not massaging her is mean, because she is actively in significant pain, and I knew these things about her prior to agreeing to the relationship.\n\nThe issue is potentially the ADHD.\n\nWe'd been courting for 6 months before we decided to move forward with a relationship. We chatted a lot in a discord roleplay server, and I asked if it was okay to flirt with her. She was over the moon about it. I moved from the pacific northwest to the hotter parts of the US, and we got an apartment together. We've been living together since June 2024.\n\nSince December 2024 (almost ten months now), her attention has waned significantly. She got into a mobile game that she hyperfixated on, and then into some discord servers that resemble old AIM group chats, and it became a problem. I would try to talk to her, would do a bid for connection, and she wouldn't reply. Like she didn't hear me. If I got her attention, it would be partial as she would be on her phone, too.\n\nI'm older than her and also less attractive. She's from a wealthy family and I was raised in poverty (starvation in government housing, but no homelessness as a child). We're very different people as far as our lives go, but we have a lot in common and like a lot of the same things. We're politically similar, we like the same stuff in bed, and our humor overlaps. \n\nThe issue is that it's been a struggle to get her attention and I'm struggling not to take it personally. I've googled ADHD issues in relationships and it seems like this could easily be an ADHD symptom, but I don't know how to handle that. Before I went into tech, I went to school to become a therapist. I can't ignore the mental health aspect, but I don't know how to not be hurt by the change in dynamic.\n\nI've told her that it's okay if we're not compatible, and that I won't hate her if it doesn't work out--we started out as friends so it's not like there's no foundation here. I also try to be supportive, but I find myself being so upset lately. Additionally, a side effect of having autism is a flat affect, so I don't emote a lot in the face and my tone stays pretty neutral. All of this is often perceived by others as me being grumpy, which I'm sure doesn't help her ADHD. A lot of people with ADHD have rejection sensitive dysphoria and I fear that I probably trigger that a lot.\n\nI don't really know what to do, I'm kind of at my wits end. We just argued for two hours and that's why I'm running here. We've argued almost every day this week and I'm becoming emotionally fatigued. Her libido is much higher than mine and I'm struggling to be as affectionate or sexual as her because I feel disliked. This is becoming an issue for her, too, as she's not feeling attractive or desirable lately as a result of me withdrawing.\n\nThere's a lot more but I'll leave it here.\n\nDoes anyone have some insight or recommendations?\n\ntl;dr: gf has ADHD and I'm feeling really ignored and lonely. Could use some support or guidance. I'm an emotionally introverted person and she's more extroverted and physical.

We have been dating two years and have had a lot of ups and downs. In total during this time we have broke up briefly twice. Once was her decision and the other mine.\n\nLately I have been feeling so deeply intwined in the relationship that I don't know what is right sometimes. If she is making a fair point or if it's my fault. The last two weeks we have faced some difficulty centred around her saying we don't spend enough time together. \n\nNow we have both been busy with work so it was difficult to spend time together during the week. Although we usually spend the majority of the weekend together. The last weekend I met a friend on Thursday and had planned to see her early in the say before this and Friday but she cancelled both days citing work and tiredness as reasons. Then after she ended the conversation by reacting with an emoji to my text on Friday afternoon I proceeded to not hear from her until Saturday midday when she began asking why I hadn't contacted. She was upset and asking if something wrong and why I wasn't excited to see her. Considering I had made two previous attempts to see her and she said \"No\" I was figuring to give her space. But was planning to contact on Saturday afternoon if I didn't hear from her and also I was a bit lost considering I sent her four previous texts which she just reacted with a thumbs up.\n\nI used to overthink these interactions a lot but have been trying not to lately. She followed up by saying that she didn't understand how I wouldn't be texting her on Saturday or why I wasn't excited to see her. But I explained I was going to but was waiting to hear from her as she ended the conversation last time and I believe she wanted space. Additional to this I tried to see her the two previous days but she turned me down. So I met her Saturday evening and made us food and the same on Sunday. However she was cold and had even dumped some crafts I made her for a while ago on to the floor. I asked her why she done that and she said it was because she was annoyed at my absence and when I wasn’t excited to see her Saturday.\n\nThe rest of Sunday was fine and I had to leave because she was going out to meet friends. When going out the door she started getting short again and said \"you are leaving me again and can't wait to get away\". I replied in a very confused manner saying the obvious fact and that was because she had plans and asked me to literally leave 30 mins before that. She says that's not the point and that I'm always dying to get away from her or always trying to not spend time with her. \n\nI went home and she sent me a message summarising this again. I replied by saying No and that I always make my best effort and also plan dates etc aswell as citing recent examples. She suggested space for a few days and I said I agree with that. Then I left one last paragraph to explain my side a bit better and how much I care but she has left it on read since.\n\nI'm a bit lost on what to do and don't know if I'm really not doing well enough or she is expecting too much from me but it has really burned me out..\n\nExtra update : might I add in response to some of the initial posts that she has also said she now doesnt feel she has a platform to address things she is unhappy with. But I am all for listening and never dismissive but this becomes increasingly hard when we are literally factually ignoring how events unfolded or the actual situation itself or clear logic", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Should I stay or go?\n\nHi strangers , first reddit post ever, hope I can get some insight into how other people would feel about My situation.\nI 28(M) have been dating a lady 29 (F) for about 2 years she has a son from a previous relationship (4) who is charming but is a child at the end of the day and that comes with its own complications.\nOur relationship  was off the back of being good friends. We have been dating long distance for just almost  a year and things went from great to not so great.\nWe are both of African descent , but now live and work in different parts of the UK. She is kind, thoughtful, selfless ( a bit too selfless because it leaves her exhausted and stretched because she says yes to everything). She has been a great friend , and a great gf .\nIssues started when we both started dating long distance, we barely got time to hang out and talk. We are both in very demanding jobs, and having a child on top of all this doesn’t help. To compensate for this, I would travel to see her, or pay for her flights to come see me. Some times the flights are really expensive (up to £300) but she doesn’t chip in. (It’s something to do with our dynamic as Africans and gender roles, having to think about her child care costs and just life. I have brought it up in conversation but we still dont have a conclusion and I dont see a solution.\nShe is constantly doing things outside her capacity to accommodate people and some times at the expense of quality time for the both of us. It’s frustrating but I try to accommodate that.\nDiscussions on things we need to work on dont go well. They often start with her ignoring me till I probe about what is going on. Or , I have to initiate these and often have to delicately state the subject otherwise she will be quite emotional, and we wont have any resolution. I often feel like I have to end up compromising.\nLastly, and I hate to admit it. Between looking after her mostly lovely child, work , and the distance, we dont have time for each other anymore. And it’s taking a toll on everything. We went from talking very often to barely talking.\nShe is also going through some disappointments at work (office politics and all) and it’s really gotten her distant and I’m left without my friend . When we talk its really just venting and trying to work through her emotions.\nI am trying to be understanding, but I feel like the relationship is really struggling, I have extended of myself for a while now financially , physically, and emotionally and I dont know how much longer it would have to go if I dont have what I crave most, the companionship. I feel alone and quite frankly so does she. Outside of moving back to her city, there is not much I can do. I left the city she works to seek more career opportunities and growth, and we both knew it was a good move for me.\nWe dont want to move in before marriage , but as Africans, there is a lotttt to consider there, between massive family demands from the girls side, and the financial costs of actually making it happen, we both realised we cannot really pull something off in the short run especially financially.\nI dont know if we can make it work for long, but I also dont know if I would be giving up too soon. If we ended things we would both be devastated , but we are both struggling to make it work and I dont know if I can go another year like this.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

My bf (23) is a NEET. (*Not in Education, Employment or Training*). Now I (F21) have been in an online relationship for close to 4 years now. We have never met. We live in the same time zone but live hours away. Our situations wont let us meet anytime soon... it sucks. Our relationship is completely secret as well. We both got mexican parents that just wouldnt understand and as a woman in a strict mexican household its not like i can fly over to see him. and ALSO i got more to say on top of that cause this is whats so damn frustrating...\n\n  \nBut before that... this is a little backstory. So we actually met on Reddit. I instantly liked him. hes everything I've ever wanted. We understood eachother in deeper levels. long story short. I am so in love with this guy. I know for a fact I wont find anyone else like him. i just feel like i wont ever find anyone i get along with more than him. So in my head he is the one. I wanna be with him forever. And like of course He gives me all his attention cause like what the fuck else does he got going on. He tells me I'm the center of his universe. He wakes up and it's all about me me me. He loves me so much. Every year we love eachother more. I don't need to go into details or anything its been 4 years ya'll get it.\n\nBut here's the thing.. He is a NEET which is literally my main problem. (like yeah I love that he seems to have me as the highlight of his life because i love his attention) but REALISTICALLY like every now and again I come back to reality and think about how we would ever be together.. now some backstory on him. He lives with his mom and brother in a tiny apartment. he sleeps in the living room so he has no privacy. never did growing up. So since we are a secret, we can't call eachother or anything. we mainly communicate through text. occasianly when possible, voice messages. so that is kinda hard because I just need a little more but i understand the situation so its okay. Now he also has severe anxiety. he tends to not leave the house much. He probably has only left the hous like 3 times this year. (hes spamming me rn haha as i write this. I've been a little avoident recently. but god damnnit i love him) anyways I've brought up my concerns multiple times. its always the same thing... he thinks he has some sort of medical problem but it's just a physical symptom of his anxiety and also the fact that he doesn't move around much. His mom cares a lot too. I know she loves him so much but shes enabling him. He needs help and i wish i was there to help him. \n\nBackstory on me. I'm in University and I'm struggling figuring that shit out. Gonna graduate way later than I was supposed to cause yk advisors kinda suck sometimes. I'm working and just overall working towards my future. Trying my best here. Especially because one day I wanna be with him. And I know I sometimes end up in the \"i need to save him\" mentality. But NOOOO. cant. nope. im not doing that. I've just been waiting  like each month.. im like \"okay okay. maybe he'll go out on a walk soon or do something that shows some kind of improvement or direction.\" then its like the same cycle. just kind of waiting to see if something happens while I'm over here trying my best to do shit with my life. with his love and support haha.\n\nThere was a significant moment that almost pushed me over the edge. My cousin and her boyfriend invited me and my brother to go on vacation to HIS STATE. HIS CITY. so you know im over here planning and scheming. anywasy fast forward. my cousin and her bf go on a date in the city and my brother wanted to stay in the hotel and drink and be alone. And i decided to go on my own adventure into the city. I wanted to test if i wouldn't get lost taking public transportation around. fast forward I did. I eventually found my way back to the hotel. my brother made fun of me. i went to go shower and i was all the sudden really upset. I was texting him about how maybe it's possible to meet up with him. (he lives like 30 minutes away from the city. and since he has no job he has no car) So if i wanted to see him I would have to go out of my way to try and get to him. So anyways back to me in the bathroom naked and crying. So im really sad and upset. because I cant see him. And i was in my head thinking about like if this was any other regular guy they would easily come and see me. Like guys do crazy shit just to spend a minute with you. so its just frustrating. Like this guy on the train was literaly talking with me and flirting with me and it just makes me sad like hes a real person and i wish it was my bf like i cant talk to him in person. he doesnt think its safe for me and also it just wasnt a realistic idea to take public transport. im too lazy to explain it but it just wasn't possible with the whole situation. I was just upset because it was the fact that he just doesnt do shit that we couldnt see eachother when i was there. And i'm unfiltering myself so much rn but like im not like this with him. these are my true inner thoughts. when i bring up this topic im straightforward but not in a rude way. \n\nAnyways i feel like i just spewed out word vomit. sorry if this doesnt make sense. It just sucks and idk if it's worth it anymore. But like at the same time I literally dont want anyone else. No one else compares to him. Plus guys irl make me feel sick in the stomach. \n\nI wanna know if any of you guys are in the same situation. I know it sounds like I am completly over this. but it would take a lot for me to potentially end this. it would hurt so much.

I said one last \"I love you\", as he had to go, visibly crying, and slowly disappearing behind people, darkness and buildings.\n\n  \nThough the time spent together was perfect, I can not forget the good bye.

Just generic titles. I hope you all understand.\n\nSo, recently my daughter's father has started acting like a complete lunatic. It started off with little insults here and there, hidden among our conversations about our daughter, which I tried to ignore, because I knew he had just lost the woman he loved (and also left me pregnant for, and abandoned his daughter for the first 3 years of her life for). But I get it. It sucks to lose someone you love. So I ignored it for as long as I could anyway.\n\nBut this last summer, was the absolute WORST. \n\nI lost half of my visitation time simply because he couldn't have been bothered to actually drop her off when he was supposed to. \n\nOur court ordered custody agreement stated that we have JOINT custody. Which means we are both allowed to have equal say in her education, her medical decisions, and her religion. it ALSO has a clause in there that I specifically requested that neither party shall disparage the other (because he has a nasty way of talking to me that is just beyond rude, and it makes co-parenting nearly impossible, which you will come to understand shortly).\n\nIt ALSO states that both parents should be allowed communication with the child with no restrictions (which he also violated when he refused to allow her to use the phone I bought her to call me).\n\nAnd it says that drop off times should be as follows: Her father shall have her during the weekdays while school is in session to ensure she is able to be close to the larger part of her family. (as at the TIME we viewed that as what would be best for HER, since I have no family here.) When school is OUT of session that schedule flips. Now the court specifies that she is to be dropped off no later than 6pm on Friday night at my house during the summer. But nearly EVERY week, I would find myself waiting until Wednesday at the wee hours of the night, before I would be able to see my daughter's  beautiful, smiling little face!\n\nSo after nearly an entire summer of his shenanigans, I had, had enough! I was beyond pissed off. So the next time he was late, I decided to call the local sheriff on him for contempt of court. Keep in mind, he was nearly 2.5 hours late (he only lives 30 minutes away on a BAD day), and when the sheriff called him, he admitted he hadn't even started getting her ready, and they were still at the house just watching movies, which means he had absolutely zero intention of dropping her off when he was supposed to, and not likely it would have even been that day. (the sheriff told me he would make a note of it on his report that it was obvious he had no intention of dropping her off).\n\nKeep in mind, the sheriff didn't even go to his house. all he did was give him a CALL. now the day I made the call, went without a hitch once the sheriff lit a fire under his ass. (but it was probably because he didn't know if the sheriff was in hiding and watching what he was doing) but the NEXT week, all HELL broke loose! He showed up at my house, pounding on my door like some crazed lunatic, screaming obscenities at me, making horrible threats, and demanding I let him into my apartment. Obviously I refused. I'm not going to let someone behaving that way into my only safe space. The worst part about all of it tough, was he had our daughter with him during all of this. She saw and heard everything he said to me that day. and man... it did a number on her. My heart breaks that she had to see and hear that nastiness. She told me he pushed her out of the way when she tried to stop him, and nearly knocked her down the stairs.\n\nWhen she (my daughter) was finally able to make it inside my apartment, she told me that he punished her after I had to call the cops on her as though SHE was somehow responsible. I just gave her a big hug, and told her it wasn't her fault, and that I am sorry that her father did that to her. (if I had known he was going to take it out on HER, I probably would have thought twice about calling the cops, but I can't help but feel his doing that is some attempt at ensuring that I don't call the cops again. his way of intimidating me by taking it out on her every time I have to do something like that.\n\nMy choice to call the cops was not made lightly. I want to make that very clear. I endured this behavior from him almost the entire summer before I lost my patience with it all. I kept making excuses for him, that he was suffering the loss of his girlfriend, and that eventually he would go back to normal, but sadly... it's only been getting worse.\n\nnow last week he tried to have me removed from her school approved visitors list so I wouldn't  be able to appear there after the teacher requested a meeting with the 2 of us. \n\nAfter I informed the teacher that I would be attending, my phone blew up with texts from her father about how he isn't going to allow me to attend, and that he was going to have me removed from the visitor's list, because my disabilities are an embarrassment to him. How he doesn't want to be seen in public with me, and how the very idea of it gives him anxiety. (real nice huh? not like i can help being disabled, and I was disabled when he met me. Not like anything changed that much since he chose to make our daughter with me) but I digress...\n\nThen this weekend he dares to drop her off in nothing but a short tee shirt, and TIGHTS (not stretch pants, but actual tights you are supposed to wear under a DRESS!) with a HUGE gaping hole in the crotch and her underwear just hanging out of them! When I \"dared\" to bring up how inappropriate it was for him to drop her off in such clothing, he started berating me for things he perceived as \"bad parenting\" but was actually just me preparing her for what is going to be happening to her body soon, as her family is KNOWN for early onset puberty. (her aunt got her first menstrual cycle at 9 years old, and I went through it at 10 if you can imagine, and since my daughter is currently 8, I wanted her to be properly prepared for it and not blind sighted like I was) but apparently that is me being \"f\\*\\*ked in the head\" according to him. I honestly don't see how I did anything wrong in preparing her for a potential early transition into womanhood. I think what I did isn't nearly as bad as what he did. He took her out in PUBLIC like that! It had to have been awfully embarrassing for her. :(\n\nAnyway, I am just looking for some advice on how I should handle all this. it has had me so overwhelmed lately, and I need to find some kind of solution that won't hurt my daughter. (or at least minimize the hurt as much as humanly possible) I understand a situation like this isn't likely to be solved without some kind of sacrifice/compromise (if it's even possible to compromise with him at this point... I dunno) \n\nBut I'm hoping that someone out there might have gone through something similar, and found a way to make it all work some how, that maybe might be able to give me some advice on how to deal with all of this insanity. \n\nI thank anyone who may comment in advance for taking the time out of their day to respond. I will do my best to answer any questions you may have, if there is anything that I may have not made clear enough, or maybe been too vague about. I was trying to tell the story as quickly as possible, but it IS kind of a long one. and for that I apologize. \n\nTLDR: my daughter's father has been consistently violating our court ordered custody agreement in an attempt to keep my daughter from me, saying nasty things about me in front of her, and even going as far as causing a huge scene at my house in front of our daughter., and dressing her in clothes that has her underwear showing in public.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We just started long distance as we are going to different colleges (6hrs apart). So far things have been going absolutely amazing, it sucks, but I feel like we are the most in love we’ve ever been because we are actively taking steps towards our future. However, this all changed last night. We had had a “hangout” planned for like a week for last night, we had been talking all day and we were so excited—overall morale was just high. But once we started FaceTiming, it just wasn’t going well. There was tons of silence and just like awkwardness (partially my fault because I was tired and just kind of not engaged), and eventually she asked if I had been feeling disconnected in the relationship. I said yes, and that I just felt like that was a natural part of long distance—sometimes we will feel super connected and sometimes we won’t—we are dating through a phone screen after all. After I responded with this she just started talking about how she had been thinking about long distance and how it just doesn’t work for her brain and that she doesn’t think she can do long distance for 4 years if she’s already disconnected, and she said this disconnect made her feel as if she “didn’t need me”. This took me by complete surprise, because I felt like everything was going amazing, and she was fronting to me like she felt the same. She said that she had been thinking this essentially since we got to college (a month ago). I asked if she was breaking up with me and she said “I don’t know”. This hurt me deeply because it felt like she had been thinking about this for a long time and just didn’t say anything, then came to me already having came to the conclusion that we should maybe break up. I feel so confused and hurt that she would throw away what we had just based on feeling disconnected because of the distance—and she didn’t even try to fix it before coming to this conclusion. She explained that it was nothing I was doing wrong and that she didn’t think it worked for her, which felt like she was telling me my best wasn’t good enough. We have had issues in the past of her not letting me in on her thoughts, and her not allowing me to be on her team, but I thought we resolved that. But last night proved to me that we didn’t resolve it, and that really broke my trust in her emotionally. We are both Christians, and so I asked if she had been praying about this and what she got out of that. She responded that she had and that she got out of it that “we should probably break up”. Which absolutely shattered me. At this point I thought we were done, but she kept insisting that after our conversation she thinks we can make this work because her feelings were validated by me and she feels like it was normal to feel. It was normal for her to feel disconnect and doubt, but the way she went about dealing with that made me feel so hurt and so disrespected. Ultimately, I want to be with her with everything in me, but my brain told me that I didn’t deserve to keep dealing with emotional whiplash. I decided that she is worth giving another chance, but I’m scared and I need advice on how we can overcome this.\nAlso, important context is that she reiterated many times that the distance was the only thing making her feel disconnected, and that she truly believed if we were together in person everything would be perfect. I visited her 2 weeks ago and she said that during that time she felt like our relationship was perfect.\n\nTL;DR my long distance girlfriend broke my emotional trust by lying to me and not letting me in on her mental processes and deciding that we might need to break up. I decided to give her another chance but I’m scared that I’m going to keep getting strung along, and I need advice on how to go forward and how we can make this work.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": [], "phase_norm": "UNKNOWN"}

My girlfriend and I (both 18) just broke up, and I’m struggling to process it because, in so many ways, she was perfect. I know everyone says that about their first love, but our connection was incredible. We went together like mint ice cream and chocolate chip. She was everything I ever wanted in a partner, she was beautiful, funny, kind, extremely intelligent, caring, funny, cute, like if we were getting married tomorrow I'd be so happy.\n\nWe started dating long-distance (I'm in the South, she's in the North) back in January. The first few months were like a magnet. We talked constantly, and the connection was amazing. I even drove up to visit her, and our time together in person was even better.\n\nThe problems started as we got closer to starting college (we're both freshmen at different schools). The dynamic started to feel dry, and I could tell she was pulling away. She finally ended it, and the reasons are completely logical and fair:\n\n* **Long distance is brutal.** She said she wasn't cut out for it anymore.\n* **The next four years would be unfair.** I would be the only one able to visit (her family is strict and took her car), plus they didn't know about me. Meaning we'd see each other maybe one week a year.\n* **We're young.** We don't know where life will take us after college.\n\nThe breakup itself was incredibly mature. There was no fight. We mutually agreed that this would be better, and if we meet up again we'll try and make it work. She then asked for some space and no contact for a while (I think to let the feelings subside Idk though), but I still just wanted to respect her.\n\nBut my heart is having a hard time accepting the logic. I feel like I've lost my soulmate. I don't want another girl; I want my girl. I want to respect her and this decision, but I'm left with this profound feeling of loss, but also a sense of freedom, Idk I was worried cause it just, I can't explain it in words correctly, like our convos got drier as she got busier, and eventually Idk it just, just felt there, but was just that. I think because she was putting a lot of thought into whether she wanted to quit it or not, I think she loves me a lot, it's not like she stopped loving me, and she didn't even know I felt like I was soloing the relationship. It's just weird...\n\nSo, my question for you all is: **How do you stop the feeling of losing someone so perfect you would have been happy with them forever?** How do you let go when the breakup was \"healthy\", but you still miss all those memories you made with thate person? All the mistakes I made, and she forgave, all the hugs, the kisses, the poems I wrote her every anniversary, and our cute things we do like sending reels, doing a mwah as a kiss, always saying goodmorning and goodnight, everytime we said I love you we put a heart underneath it. Even when I was clingy sometimes she just accepted me, and when I felt sad or alone she consulted me, and I'd do the same if she'd open up too. Like how do you move on from that, and the cute nick names, the wedding dresses we looked at, the shows we looked at, the list of names we'd love to give to our kids, choosing the house we wanted and talking about how we'd like? I just don't know how to move on from all of that. Even though we're friends still, I wanna hear her jokes, and ask about her day, and write a poem on our monthly anniversary, and play videogames, and make drawings, I just don't know how to move on from loving someone like that. I really don't want another girl, I had the most perfect girl, and I tried my best, but LDR is limited, and it wouldn't be fair to force her to stay with me, just because of feelings, if she doesn't wanna do LDR, then i have to respect her wishes. \n\nI just would love some advice, what do you do? \n\n**TL;DR:** My (18M) first girlfriend (18F) was perfect for me, but we had a mature, mutual breakup because of the reality of long-distance and starting college. I logically understand why it had to end, but I'm emotionally struggling to let go of the feeling that I lost \"the one.\" How do you move on from a person who felt perfect for you?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I desperately need advice and perspective from people who have been in LDRs.\n\nI (f24) met someone online (m24) about three months ago, and quickly became very close. It turned romantic and we started to really like each other, and I visited him last week. He lives in Portugal, I live in the US. We had the most amazing time together, and we both realized we’ve fallen in love. Being with him was the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. He has never really met someone that he wanted to really be with before (more hookups, nothing long term, and the few that he did really like hurt him badly). We both felt like we’d finally met the person we wanted to spend forever with. I met many of his friends, some of them referring to me as his girlfriend and saying he was so excited about me coming and wouldn’t stop talking about it. He’s never before introduced a girl to his friends before.\n\nI also completely fell in love with Portugal. Even without him, I genuinely loved being there. I have kind of always felt like something was missing or I was meant to do something else, and there I felt like I belonged and could see myself there. The pace and ways of life just fit me so well, and I am homesick for there. I have always daydreamed about moving somewhere else and joked about it, deep down not joking, and honestly really don’t want to be in the US anymore.\n\nLeaving was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The pained look on his face when my car was pulling away literally haunts my dreams. I have been back for 48 hours and feel like my heart has been torn in two and half of it stayed there with him.\n\nI am fully aware that given more time together, we might end up not being a match. Like all couples, sometimes you end up not fitting. So I’m not saying he IS the one, just that right now it feels like it, I want to give it a fair shot but HATE long distance, and I feel absolutely hollow being back here.\n\nNow for the reality of it. Being with him means moving away, and I am very close with my family. My mom is one of my best friends, and I’ve always imagined being close to them when I have kids. I love holidays with them. Random visits. They are my people, and while I need my people, I have always said that I think once I have my PERSON I think I could go further from them and not have them as my main support system.\n\nToday someone told me that I’d be choosing a boy over my family. And it pains me to think about losing my family. Not seeing my parents age or my grandparents before they pass or missing little get togethers. Not raising a family with them around.\n\nOn one hand, this absolutely kills me. On the other, I feel like moving just across the ocean (I’m on east coast, he’s on west), is not that different than my sister who lives across the country and we see maybe twice a year. The only real difference is that she can hop in a car when flights are too expensive. So logically, I know it wouldn’t be the end of the world, considering I would move away eventually anyway, but emotionally I feel terrible about it. Torn in two again.\n\nI guess I’m so absolutely overwhelmed by emotions and input from people who don’t understand that I’m at such a loss of what to do. I really really really want to get back to him asap. I want to spend maybe a month or two with him and see the reality of it a bit better. But I’m scared to get hurt worse if I end up deciding I can’t leave my family after all that time with him. On the other hand, I can’t imagine life without him right now, and I need to choose what is best for me and go where I feel called to. I feel like I can’t handle not being with him, but also don’t know if I could handle being away from my people here.\n\nI don’t know whether it’s normal to feel so torn in an LDR. I don’t know how you guys handle the grief and pain and yearning, and would love literally any and all advice you guys could give.\n\nTLDR: Met my long distance bf online 3 months ago, spent a week together last week in person at his place in Portugal. Realized we’re in love. Also absolutely loved Portugal and would love to live there regardless of him. Went back to USA and missing him like crazy. Feeling absolutely shattered in long distance and don’t know how to cope. Want to go back asap to get out of this pain, but also want to spend a month or two there to see more of the reality of life with him. However, super close with my fam here, and would miss them so so badly moving permanently. Concerned that I shouldn’t even let this go on if I’m unsure if I could do the move, but also don’t know if I’m thinking too big right now. Can’t imagine life without him and so completely confused and screwed.

During her first month abroad, I already visited her because I wanted to support her. She moved there alone with no help, and I brought her everything she left behind, her essentials and her hometown foods.\n\nA few months later, she started flying. She’s a cabin crew member, and it’s a really exhausting job. I work in corporate, doing 12 to 13 hours a day. Still, I always tried to adjust to her schedule because I was scared we’d get used to not communicating. Even before LDR, we weren’t always on our phones. And she’s always been so independent, which made me afraid she’d get used to not having me around.\n\nFor the past 2 to 3 months, she stopped asking me for help during her layovers in other countries. But I didn’t mind, because I didn’t want to push her. Still, I started feeling her becoming distant in the past couple of weeks. So I asked her what was going on and told her I wanted us to fight for this. I just needed us to communicate even just once a day. Not in an automated way like “I’m going out now” or a short “goodnight.” I was scared the love would fade without real conversations or time for each other.\n\nShe works with many men because of her job, and she’s told me that a few have asked her out. That scares me, not because I don’t trust her, but because someone else might give her the spark that we can’t create anymore because of the distance and time.\n\nShe told me she’s been trying to find our love again for a month. But now she says she feels trapped, like the relationship is just a commitment that’s weighing her down. She said she wants to choose herself this time and love herself first.\n\nWhat hurts the most is she told me she lied about our plans to get married in 5 years. She said she never really wanted marriage, and only said those things so I wouldn’t get hurt. But she’s told me countless times before that she wanted to be my housewife, that she wanted me to work and provide, and she’d stay home. She also told me that she was only going overseas to earn enough money to come back here and start a business.\n\nBut yesterday, she said she feels more alive with her job and traveling the world, compared to staying in our home country. That hit me hard because I know there were so many times she said she hated the job, that she was emotionally and mentally drained. I’m so confused. A part of me feels like she said all that just so I wouldn’t wait for her.\n\nI can’t help but think she’s just burned out from work, and that I’ve become part of that burden. I feel bad for pushing her. I’m willing to give her more time. If she doesn’t want to talk for a whole month, I’ll accept that.\n\nI just don’t want to lose her. I still want her as my lover, and I truly believe our love is real.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

How to handle this?\n\nWe’ve been together 5 years and she is my whole world, we only ever talk to each other and share everything. Atleast that’s what I thought.\n\nOver the last few months, I’ve gotten really really busy with work so I couldn’t give her that much time during the day and there have been several fights between us where I also said some things to her which might have given her the idea that I don’t want a future with her. But then we would talk again and be happy again.\n\nI get that being unclear and busy with work is probably my fault, so I decided to give her another chance.\n\nWhile we were in the car I caught her chat with a guy. She claimed first that he is a friend, when I confronted and snatched her laptop she got defensive and blamed me at first, and then told she is talking to him since 4-6 months.\n\nI read their chats but tbh I was so shook that I couldn’t pay attention, and I quietly dropped her home without uttering a word and came back to my house crying like a kid.\n\nAfter which, she said she deleted all the chats, and blocked the guy (she showed me that she did). When I texted the guy from 2 numbers he also blocked me. He lives in the UK, she said she never met him IRL, nor called or video called and he was only a friend. But in person, the way she behaved when I confronted her is really opposite. So tbh I don’t know what to believe\n\nAlthough I’m 99% sure she did not meet this guy in person, but the thought that she may do this again is driving me crazy. I am not a crazy type guy and I run a startup and am the sole earner of my family, so I cannot afford to run behind her to check all the time.\n\nShe also does her job at my company only coz I want her to get in a better financial state so our entire lives are intertwined. I decided to give her a chance and told her that we can stay in a relationship n try but if this time I catch this again I will just leave.\n\nSince we are together since 5 years I’m not just able to abandon her in 1 go. She even cut her hand and sent me a picture and was crying the entire day, so the situation was pretty bad.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’ve decided to give her a chance but I’m not sure if I’m doing the right thing. I’ve been cheated on twice now, 1 with my ex, and 1 right now (don’t think it’s cheating exactly if they were only friends but I don’t have a clue and I’ll never know, I couldn’t see anything weird in the chats but they seemed super close friends language wise).\n\nI also took a screenshot of her blocked list but I’m not sure how to find in future coz if she does it again she will be just more careful.

He’s been really stressed with work and finances and managing a house on his own (even though his family live with him they don’t really help out and leave a mess that he has to clean up), he’s in a lot of pain and will potentially need surgery for an ongoing problem, not to mention the political climate (he lives in the USA). I’ve been struggling to find a full-time job, been recovering from surgery myself, the political climate here (UK) is scary and I’ve had some family issues going on. Not to mention we’ve both been feeling the distance a little more than usual. So we’ve both been really stressed and a little snappy with one another but we’ve always been able to circle back and talk it through.\n\nI’d just returned to my part time job yesterday after two months off, a six hour cleaning shift at a fairly popular gym and pool - so nothing too egregious but it was still a challenge for me because my surgery site was causing me some pain and there’d been some changes at the gym that I had to adapt to. \n\nMy partner also works Saturdays (overtime) and after which he would call me. This call comes through at around 8-9pm my time. My partner called me at this time yesterday but I was still at work, no big deal I just assumed he forgot and sent him a message reminding him. He then replies ‘yes but you still could’ve answered’ - which, for the record, unless it was an emergency I really couldn’t have. I have to be on the go the entire time because my managers think 6 hours is plenty of time to do 12 hours worth of work. But he sent the ‘👀’ and ‘what if I was dying’ so I just assumed it was meant to be a joke.\n\nI joked back that if it was an emergency knowing him I wouldn’t have found out until after it happened (which is true, there’s been a couple times where emergencies have happened and I’ve not found out until after they’ve been sorted) and, just in case he was being serious, told him that if it had been any other time I would’ve answered first thing or if he had spammed called me.\n\nHe doesn’t reply to my messages. I get home, call him, but he’s busy so we don’t really do anything. He texts me today saying he still would’ve appreciated if I’d have answered and that he ‘obviously knew I was working’ and that he ‘answers [my] calls when [he’s] working’ (which to my memory I’ve never called him while he’s working so maybe he has a point there) and that he shouldn’t have to spam call me to get through to me in an emergency. I acknowledged his point, apologised, and explained that if I had any inkling that it was an emergency and not just his regular end of day call I would’ve picked up on the first ring no hesitation. He then told me that it wasn’t an emergency and he just wanted to see if I’d answer so he knew who to call if it was, along with the 👍🏻 and 👌🏻 emojis which I thought was a bit petty.\n\nI reminded him that not once have I not answered his call - excluding the times it didn’t connect properly at which point I called him back straight away. And he’s left me on read.\n\nI find myself being angry because he knew this was my first day back at work in two months after surgery, that I needed to adjust to everything and see how the pain levels were on my surgery site, and he decided now was the best time to test me. And not only that he had me feeling guilty for missing an emergency when it wasn’t even an emergency, he just wanted to see if I’d be there for him which, in my opinion, I have been (I was there when he fell off a roof, I was there when his mum tried to off himself, I’ve been there for him and helping with financial issues whenever I could). But on the other hand if he genuinely felt the need to test me on this then I’m worried if I’ve somehow let him down somewhere.\n\nTLDR: partner called me on my first day of work in two months, then when I didn’t answer acted like it was an emergency that I’d missed, then told me it wasn’t an emergency he just wanted to see if I’d answer.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}
{"id": "u/TVStaticTakeover_786", "user": "u/TVStaticTakeover", "text": "My partner (25f) and I (25m) don’t know how to handle living with her parents. One issue we need help with.\n\nHey y’all, normally my partner and I have been together for 4.5 years and can work through any issues we come across, given enough time and communication. There have been a couple issues we’ve come up on that no matter how much we talk about it, and plan, it always goes back to its old state.\n\nRecently due to health issues leading to financial issues, my partner, I, and our two kids (2 and 10 mo) needed to move in with her parents. Her parents are not good people,  I knew this before we got together, and her whole family is disrespectful to her and caters to an awful man because of traditional values. I’ve encouraged her to make Reddit posts about her family encounters but she doesn’t want to think about it all again which I understand. \n\nAll this to say, we have not been allowed to alter the house outside of the dining room and side room to make room for the 4 of us. We are allowed one shelf in the fridge and out of three bathrooms, we may use one as our bathroom and the other if we or the kids need bathing, our bathroom is a 1/2 bath. It was nice of them for allowing us to stay with them for the time being, but everyday they complain about something because we are there. Over the last couple months, we have not felt welcome here, us or the kids.\n\n Her parents are hoarders and my partner has been keeping up with it as much as she can so her dad doesn’t have to live in it. He would be doing more but is severely disabled, a spot he was put in both due to unfortunate events and his own decisions. Her mom doesn’t do anything around the house, often leaving food and dirty dishes everywhere that the three cats get into and get sick. Trash build in the garage and maggots are everywhere if my partner and I don’t take it out. Mold was in every room, most corners of rooms. My partner dealt with it best she could. Food expired months and years ago sitting in the fridge and cupboards. There’s so much more I could think of and further I can’t remember now.\nBefore I lost my job due to a tonic clonic seizure I had during my shift, and we moved in with her parents, my partner got a part time job in the restaurant industry and I have become a stay at home dad, my favorite job so far. \n\nMy partner was a stay at home mom while I was working and we had developed a system that worked for us at the apartment. I woke up early with the kids and let her sleep until she got up or I had to work, often 2-3 hours. We’d all hang out when I got home, and if the chores needed done before night, I’d knock em out because she liked to crochet while watching the kids and that’s harder to do while washing bottles. I’d do whatever remaining chores at the end of the night and go to bed with her when everything was done, and we both felt like it was a good balance, since the kids burn us out quicker than customers. \n\nNow that I stay home with the kids, we aren’t allowed to and can’t afford to baby proof entirely, I still get up with the kids and still have to find time to do housework. I can’t take my eyes off the 2 year old because no room is safe out of sight for even a few minutes. Because of my epilepsy, I have been doing housework in the morning instead of night because sleep deprivation is a big trigger for me and our 10 month old keeps us up all night. The kids usually wake up for 6:30-7:00 am to start the day, and anything they do will not wake my partner. They sleep in a modified dining room so attempts at making walls and doors to keep them in has been unsuccessful. We don’t have room or money for as many baby’s gates as we would need for their room, and is difficult with the room orientation. They have 3 bedrooms but both parents have their own rooms and the room her sibling stayed in growing up is closed off because of health hazards. Her sibling is the worst person we both know because of his past actions and current opinions. A Reddit post all in itself. \n\nGetting off track, it’s hard to watch kids anytime but in a dangerous house, it feels twice as difficult. Getting housework done while watching them feels impossible, a sentiment my partner shared, a reason I was fine seeing everything that I needed to do that night when I got home. They are a handful. Now I’m expected to do both or risk getting half the sleep I’d normally get after doing chores at night.\n\nWe’ve talked multiple times about her getting up in the morning with me and the kids so I can wash bottles for the baby before she goes to work. Dishes and trash if I have time. Or laundry, stocking diaper areas, prepping food, whatever I need to do. She agrees and the next morning I try to wake her up to be with us and it takes a few times, but she comes out. The next day maybe the same, after that not until we have another big discussion about it. Her meds do make her more tired and difficult to wake if she takes them later and I love her so I’ve been understanding.\n\nI completely get body chemistry being messed up on top of being exhausted. I also completely get me needing an extra hand to lessen stress and getting sleep, my biggest triggers for my epilepsy. I really don’t know what to do here. We have an amazing relationship that has been getting better by the week, (we all have off days) and I’m so proud of how far we have both come in becoming healthier people with more communication.\nI suppose this post is asking if anyone has been in a similar spot and how they handled it. \n\nAnyone been on meds that make them tired, and any tips or tricks learned through experience. I know she doesn’t want to feel tired all the time. These meds have been the only thing that has worked well for her with only minor side effects. Ultimately, I need to remind myself that eventually, there will be time even if it’s one bottle at a time, I just want to make sure I’m not building any resentment to the situation or her.\n\nI love my family more than anything, and I’d do anything for, but we’re in a tough spot and need some advice. If nothing else, it was nice expressing feeling about her parents a little. I talked to my partner and she agreed it might be good to ask for advice on this. What can we do in this situation?\nThanks for reading, and hopefully I won’t feel a need to post here again. I’ll clear up any confusion if this is seen by anyone. That you in advance\nTL:DR My partner and I need advice on how to get everything done with the kids and a house not ready for kids.

We talked for about a week on the app before he was in town for work and met in person. Our first date was picture perfect and we had instant chemistry - it was actually how crazy how well we got along and what being with eachother felt like.\n\nHowever, after he went home, he started to distance himself from me. We talked a bit about it and basically he had originally intended to move out my way within the next 12 months but because of family matters (one of his parents is in end stage heart failure), he couldn't bring himself to do it since he is very close with this parent and the only sibling that lives nearby and who can take care of them. He told me he didn't want to do a long distance relationship either because he had a poor experience/rejection the last time he was in one (which was relatively recently). This was something he was upfront with at the start and it basically hinged on him moving out my way from the get go so this wasn't a surprise to me.\n\nI was really upset that we couldn't pursue our original \"plan\" on how we'd get together but we agreed that we'd keep talking/seeing eachother casually irl without any expectations in the meantime. I will also say that he is being genuine - we have a lot of overlapping mutual friends since we work in the same industry (we found that out after we matched on the app) and they've had nothing but good things to say about him as a person.\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to navigate a relationship/situationship like this. I don't want to be told \"just walk away\". I want genuine advice on what to expect, how to communicate, and if anyone else has ever been in a similar boat. It's a really crappy situation but I'm trying to put my best foot forward and be supportive and flexible since this is quite unusual.

{"id": "u/barbieandbrainsmd_1596", "user": "u/barbieandbrainsmd", "text": "no longer attracted to my bf, but I really want to be :/\n\nFirstly, I am already emotionally going through it and I know all of this sounds evil on my part, I am begging for a slither of compassion in your responses:\n\n**TL;DR:** I (25F) just moved in with my boyfriend of abt 5 years (25M) while starting med school, and I’ve lost physical attraction to him. I love that he’s smart, hardworking, cooks for me daily, respects my boundaries, and has taught me healthier communication. But I’m overwhelmed by his poor hygiene, messiness, immaturity (not locking doors, no helmet, hasn’t seen a dentist in 6 years), and the fact that I don’t feel protected with him. He’s also lost a lot of weight and shaved his beard, which affected my attraction more than I expected. I feel guilty because I keep saying yes to sex during the day but backing out later, and he can sense I’m not attracted to him. I want to want him again, but I don’t know if attraction can come back or if I’m trying to change our situation vs. trying to change *him*.\n\nI (25F) feel horrible because my boyfriend (25F) and I just moved in together after almost 5 years of dating, and on top of adjusting to a new city and starting med school, I’m struggling with the fact that I’ve lost physical attraction to him, and I don’t know how to build it back (but I want to badly). I have realized this especially bc, though he respects me and never pressures me to, I feel bad constantly saying no to sex or agreeing in the moment and then dreading it later. I want to want him again, but between the stress of school and many things I'll elaborate on (our messy apartment, his slow changes with hygiene and self-care, the way he’s stopped taking care of himself physically, and the fact that I don’t always feel protected with him), my attraction feels like it’s at zero and that scares me sm.\n\nFirstly I will say there are a ton of things I love and appreciate about him, he is an incredibly hard worker and incredibly smart, care so much for his work and being a mentor to others in our field too, he is a great cook and cooks for me every day especially bc I hate cooking (and I always compliment him on his food, even if I dont love it, bc cooking for those he loves seems to be one of his love languages), he’s helpful and great when it comes to school, and, the biggest one, he’s taught me such healthier ways of communicating than the violent ways I grew up with. He cares about me, he’s attracted to me, and when it comes to sex, he always respects my boundaries and makes sure I want to. I know he genuinely tries to be a good boyfriend for me.\n\nBut I can’t deny the other side. He’s a messy and honestly kind of gross person when it comes to his space and sometimes hygiene, and leaves things everywhere. He’s aware of his bad habits and says he wants to change, but the change is happening so, so slowly. Many of these habits I think we can work past as we learn how to live together. However, one that has been bothering me a ton: he hasn't been to the dentist in almost 5 years for no reason at all but laziness, even though he is also training to be a healthcare practitioner. I get so worried that habits like this will translate to our future kids (I know it's an extrapolation but we are in our mid 20s so I do want to think ahead a bit). Genuinely I am so scared of being a \"married single mother.\"\n\nAnother big thing is that I rarely feel safe or protected with him, which is huge. I don't love the terms feminine and masculine energy, but if feminine energy is being able to (when you want to) turn off your brain when with your partner bc you trust he’ll do his best to keep you safe, I feel like I can never do that. Not that he doesnt care about me, he just acts like a frail kid who’s clueless sometimes and I hate having to take on the “masculine” role. If we’re in a dangerous neighborhood and I voice being uncomfortable, he’ll make fun of me or reprimand me for “feeding into stereotypes,” forgetting that as a Black woman I need to be careful of my surroundings and can’t navigate the world the way he can as a white man. He forgets to lock our front door all the time and I am the one each night going to make sure theyre all locked, he makes jokes when I mention the importance of closing the windows at night or when we leave, and he won’t wear a helmet when biking even though all his friends do (I add this in to show the immaturity, he bikes everywhere and has literally seen plenty of patients die due to not wearing a helmet and yet is still stubborn). He hasn’t gone to the dentist in over six years and avoids scheduling his own doctor appointments like I said before. These things make me feel more vulnerable to harm with him than if I were on my own, and that’s a really hard feeling to carry in a relationship. Besides cooking, I don’t feel like he makes my life easier, but theyre all action things that I feel like one could work on, but bc it’s so many idk if I am being realistic.\n\nOn top of that, I feel so bad because every single day that my boyfriend asks if we can have sex, I say “sure, we totally can that evening,” but as the night goes on, I get really stressed out often because of how much work I have to do, and I ultimately, almost inevitably, end up saying no. My ADHD is really getting at me, and the additional thing I am so upset to admit is that just because of the vibes of our relationship right now, and everything I described before, I’m just not physically attracted to him right now. I forgot to add that he lost so so much weight since I first met him, and I feel bad that I’m not attracted to him but I have known for years that I am not super into really skinny men. He lost 50 pounds (not due to any physical or mental illness or struggle, simply bc when he’s busy he “forgets” to eat as if he’s not a 6ft grown man with a fast metabolism and then eats like 1500 cal a day max), he’s not going to the gym, he’s not eating enough and gets super upset when I asked if he’s eaten, just for him to respond that he had a bagel 10 hours prior. One thing I loved and complimented often was his beard (many other ppl did too) bc he looked so much more manly with it and less like a child, but he got rid of it. I should love him either way but wow that made a bigger difference in my attraction to him than I thought. And when I ask him to bring it back he gets annoyed that I keep bringing it up and am not just attracted to him now. He didnt even need to shave the beard, whatever. Anyway, after I say during the day (admittedly often bc I feel like I need to out of obligation or to not hurt his feelings again) that we can have sex, the evening comes, and he’s super touchy and everything, and I’m just not in it, and he can sense it.\n\nHe recently literally asked me, “I feel like you’re not attracted to me, don’t initiate anything.” And he’s right. I don’t feel attracted to him, and I don’t know how to fix that but I want to. I feel bad constantly saying no all the time, especially when I’ve said yes previously. He respects me and never pushes, but I just feel bad constantly letting him down. I know sex is important in our relationship, and I don’t know how to approach this right. I am positive that my libido is not low bc of the way I think about or look at other guys, but I don’t want to be that person. It’s despicable behavior and I only want to have eyes for my partner, but I don’t know how to cultivate that. \n\nSometimes, I feel low moments when I feel pretty sure this relationship is not for me, because, though I would be hurt, I’d also be a bit relieved if he like cheated on me or something and gave me a reason to leave and date someone I am more physically attracted to. But at the same time, I want to try, because I also acknowledge that my recent bouts of depression and stress from all these changes could be resulting in me being much more negative than needed. I don’t want to hurt him.\n\nWhat I’m struggling with is this: I don’t know where the line is between trying to change our situation (helping him with his unhealthy habits, us working on communication, me learning how to manage my stress better) versus trying to change him as a person (his nature, his personality, who he really is). And I don’t know if it’s even possible for physical attraction to come back once it feels gone, people talk all the time about cultivating it but I usually see how that stems from personality and behavior, the latter of which I am struggling to be attracted to also.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar spot, how did you know the difference between asking for change vs. realizing you just weren’t compatible? And if you did stay, did attraction ever come back?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I’m considering getting a divorce.\n\nMy husband and I are a long distance couple, we met here on Reddit while being in different countries and our relationship has mostly transpired at a distance (continents and time zones away). We have been together for almost two years and decided to get married two months ago.\n\nRecently, he came to the country I’m currently residing in for two weeks. Everything was ok, we had some disagreements but we worked through them. He’s always been the most patient and sweetest man to me. Since yesterday night was his last night here and I know how much he wanted to play board games and socialize, I invited the classmates from my postgrad program to my shared apartment to play games and drink.\n\nMy husband began drinking immediately and by the end of the night he had basically drank about 70% of all the alcohol by himself. I have seen him drink and hold his alcohol before so I trusted he knew his limits. However, last night I saw a version of him I have never seen and it has truly scared me. \n\nHe began being loud and slurring, then he said he wanted to go to a bar but since my friends were leaving and his flight requires us to be up early in the morning, I told him I don’t think it was happening. At around this time, one of my friends who had already left called me terrified and told me that a guy had followed her and was harassing her and that she’ll send me her location because she was extremely scared. I told her ok and offered to send a taxi if she needed for her to come back here but she said it was ok and a girl she saw on the street was helping her get home. \n\nI began putting away and cleaning the mess in the apartment while checking my friend’s live location. At this time, I noticed my husband putting on his shoes. I intercepted him at the door and asked where he was going and he said to the bar and I asked him if he was going alone and he asked if I to come with to which I replied no because we have to be up early tomorrow and he hadn’t even taken the keys and it’s dangerous to go out at this time. Then he went back into my bedroom while I cleaned and I thought everything would be ok, but then I saw him head out. After realizing it was too quiet while I tidied up I realized he had left the apartment completely. Soon after, he called me and was being incoherent so I asked him where he was and why he left. At this point I began crying because he had taken the only set of keys I had and I felt terrified of going out to search for him alone without my keys (without a way to return home if I was in danger, especially after what my friend had told me had happened to her).\n\nHe continued being incoherent and this went as a back and forth when he didn’t want to tell me where he was or was too drunk to. He kept hanging up and while that was happening I was also getting updates from my friend so I missed a couple of his calls. I called him back once more and he asked me WHAT DO YOU WANT? So I hung up. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to do, I called one of my classmates who also lives in this building and asked her for her keys because I wanted to go out looking for my husband. I was terrified for him because he had taken his phone, wallet and passport with him as well as the keys. Without hesitation, she and another classmate came over and offered to go out with me to search for him. \n\nThe three of us went out and sure enough there were guys in the street who catcalled and tried talking to us, we ignored them but honestly I felt extremely grateful for them being there with me in this situation. I was on the phone with my husband trying to get him to describe where he was but he was truly not making sense at all and I began to get frustrated, so one of my classmates offered to take the phone from me and try talking to him. She did and after walking for around 15 minutes we saw him stumbling in the middle of the street. We went to him and he immediately collapsed on the floor. \n\nHe laid there for a while, while we tried to wake him up and put him on his side. One of my friends went to get a glass of water and at this time a few passerbys had stopped to ask if everything was ok since it was a weird scene I guess: three women trying to move a guy on his side in the middle of the sidewalk at midnight on a weekday. We managed to get him awake and sitting up and tried giving him the water but he kept spitting it, so then we tried to get him up and moving towards the apartment building. My classmates were incredible, they helped hoist him up and pull him and help him walk (he was mostly shuffling while we carried his weight).\n\nDuring this time, he kept asking my friends where they were from and trying to talk to people on the street. He asked a group of guys if they had penises and also tried to talk to a homeless guy who was on the floor. We kept trying to keep him from engaging with people because he was being obnoxious. Then, he kept talking loudly to one of my classmates, he stopped and tried to grab her wrists while talking loudly to her. I saw her get visibly uncomfortable and I stepped in and told him hey please stop trying to grab her, don’t grab her like that. He looked at me and asked if I was mad and I just told him let’s keep walking. He then pushed me, not too hard but I did stumble. My friends told him not to be mean to me like that because I’m just worried for him and we’re just trying to get him home. He then said hey (my name) fuck off. It took every bit of me not to cry at that moment. I was already feeling extremely embarrassed about how he had been acting and about him trying to grab my friend and screaming at people in the street, but this was too much. \n\nWe continued walking and he screamed his head off on the way, shouting incoherent things. As we approached the building where I live, my husband suddenly took off running and we had to run after him, then he tried to pee at the door of the building and I had to stop him. There were police near the building and I wanted to avoid him getting arrested. We got him inside the building and he collapsed in the lobby in front of the elevators. We got him up and moving and then when we reached our floor he ran again towards the very end of the hall and again tried to pee. Again I had to run after him and literally shove his zipper back up again. I got him to the apartment and he entered my room and closed the door. I was left to thank my friends and say goodbye.\n\nI was afraid of what I would find in my room, but when I got in he was just passed out on my bed snoring. He briefly lifted his head when he sat me enter and said you don’t care about me. I hid behind my closet and sobbed for a few minutes wondering what the hell did I get myself into. This has been one of the most embarrassing and stressful experiences of my entire life. I can’t stop thinking that if it hadn’t been for my friends, I would probably still be out there without a key and a means to come home, exposed to who know what dangers, roaming the streets of the city searching for this man. I am terrified. \n\nI have to mention I also just underwent an invasive medical procedure which required me to not do physically exerting activities for a week or two and he knew this and still he had no qualms putting me in this situation. I have realized through this and other situations that this man doesn’t have any regard or compassion towards me at all. When he woke up after throwing up all over my floor, he dismissed what he did and said it was all easily solvable. He watched me almost puke all over myself while cleaning his disgusting puke off my floor. Yesterday night I didn’t sleep at all because of this and I felt the cramping this has caused on the area I was operated on throughout the day. I don’t think he understands how deeply this has altered the image I had of him, he is exactly like my father used to be with my mother and and that terrifies me. I am seriously considering getting a divorce soon.

He denied them. He said his ex had bugged his phone and was stalking him making dating profiles but he would not report it due to her ties with the mafia. Another time he blamed Tinder for stealing his information and making a fake profile. (These messages came from someone I know and consider to be a reliable source)\n\n• I am a student. He urged me to quit my job in January with promises that he would take care of me. In most fights it was held over my head how he works and supports me and made me feel guilty like I owed him.\n\n• He has this “overly sensitive sweet guy” persona. \n\n• He made me feel like I couldn’t leave, and I started to feel like a prisoner in my own home. I also didn’t have the option to leave because of the financial control he had over me. I can’t leave school in the middle of the semester to go back home to my parents either because I will owe all my FAFSA back. \n\nNow, even though I’ve broken up with him, we’re still living together. The lease, utilities, and internet are all in his name. I offered to take over the bills, but he brushed me off and made excuses about why I “didn’t need to worry about it.” \n\nThat keeps me dependent on him, even though I don’t want to be. He’s still paying for things, acting like he’s doing me a favor, and he is buying me groceries, making me lunch, being overly nice all while at the same time refusing to leave. \n\nI’m relieved the relationship is over, but I’m also scared and feel like I’m carrying this all alone.\n\nHow can I move forward to gain my financial dependence if my name is on nothing? \nI should be able to work or take out a loan soon for income he is just not really allowing me to pay for things out of his love for me. I don’t think I can keep living with him though.

The problem at hand is that we don't act like platonic friends at all. She essentially treats me like her partner. She's emotionally open with me about a lot of personal problems, calls on me for things outside of sexual intimacy, and has gotten jealous at the idea of me being with other people who aren't her on multiple occasions. She puts a lot of emphasis on how she likes me way more than any other friend she's fooled around with before. Still, it seems like whenever she catches herself acting too sappy with me, she turns around and starts rambling about how I'm such a good friend to her and how she loves being commitment-free or whatever.\n\nWe went to a park for a little picnic-style thing last week (we looked up a list of cute hangout ideas and that was next on it) and just talked about anything the whole time, but as the afternoon went on, things got kind of heated. I called her a pet name that had a more romantic tone to it, which caused her to kind of freeze up for a minute before she jumped right back into flirting with me again. She didn't acknowledge it too much; she just told me it felt a little strange but was pretty much okay with it since I was the one calling her it. I tried to brush off the weird feeling this gave me, but chose to sort of confront her about the way she's been treating me (the way she's so quick to give yet pulls back at random has done a number on my mental health).\n\nI ask her if we can really continue on as we are, sort of allude to the fact that this isn't a normal friendship, and start trying to talk about how this all makes me feel kind of lead on when she just immediately stops me right there. My friend's easygoing demeanor switches to annoyed within seconds, and she asks me how I could just spring this on her out of nowhere and mentions how I basically ruined our hangout by bringing these things up. She tells me that I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to this whole thing and goes on about how she doesn't own anyone anything. After all of that, she tells me to take her home and I do so after apologizing.\n\nI still feel guilty about everything, but honestly... Was that wrong of me to do?

When we started dating, I was still in the process of moving on from my toxic ex. I didn’t expect a relationship, but we just clicked. I felt understood and seen by him, and he has helped me to love and believe in myself. I’m young, yes I know, but I feel like I’ve met the love of my life. \n\nA few months ago, maybe 4 months into our relationship - he told me that he had applied for school in September. So of course I was happy and excited for him. Then he told me that it was going to be in another province. Then it hit me. I remember he told me that he wouldn’t do long distance. I got upset. Not because he was going away and pursuing his dream, but because he didn’t consider me in his future. I know I only met the guy. I know. But sometimes, you just know you know? \n\nI remember that conversation ending with me telling him that I’m not the one to hold him back. I’m his biggest supporter. But of course, I want him to put in the same effort as I will. Mind you, it’s a $60 plane ride and 1 hour time difference. So I really don’t see the big issue. I know I will try my best to love and support him. \nAt the end, we both agreed to make it work and try when the time comes. \n\nThen this is where it gets complicated. He was very busy with work and pre-production for his movie that he barely had time for me. I had no problems with it of course because he kept constant communication. But I guess he started thinking like if he’s like this now, how can he treat me well when we’re thousands of kilometres apart? Then he got the news that he was admitted into the school. He didn’t tell me until a week later and after I brought it up. \n\nFor some reason, he has convinced himself that the relationship will turn sour and may even resent me. He’s always been the type of guy to go through things on his own. His parents did LDR but didn’t survive. His father was absent and they only talked on the phone. His parents made promises to each other but didn’t keep it. But I’m here trying to tell him that we are not his parents. We can be our own. We can choose to love each other. It’s a choice.\n\nHowever with his fear… He said that we “have” to breakup.\n\nI don’t think we “have” to. I’m disappointed that he’s letting the fear decide. He said that we did try “ldr” when he was busy with pre production. AND IM SO CONFUSED BECAUSE HE WAS STILL HERE SO HOW WAS THAT TRYING??? \n\nI don’t know… \n\nPlease help me. Please give me advice.

{"id": "u/monieo_1487", "user": "u/monieo", "text": "After a 12 year relationship, I've never had so many ups and downs from dating in my life. I feel lost.\n\nFor some context (this will take a bit of space, apologies), my ex and I (F29) were together for 12 years - we grew up together from 16/17 to 29/30. We travelled all over the world, we moved in together, we raised my dog. I thought this was going to be my life.\n\nWe decided to open our relationship about 7 years in, we were inexperienced in dating and wanted to have some fun. I was his first, and he was my second intimate relationship. I wanted him to experience everything the world could offer. We talked a lot about how shitting dating was for the both of us, how strange some people were, to bad dates to just borderline bonker stories we'd had. We were content. We were still intimate; we had each other to fall back on.\n\nThen it moved to a poly relationship a few years later- I was more hesitant about this; as much as I enjoyed going on dates and meeting new people I only really wanted one primary partner. I feel like we were being intimate less, acting more like housemates than partners. We were arguing more. He got another girlfriend, It wasn't working out for me despite my efforts in dating.\n\nWe eventually hit a peak where he told me it wasn't working out. I was devastated but I felt like I could see this coming, we probably should have broken up 5 years ago when we started experimenting with relationship types. I felt like I had been grieving this relationship for many many years but persisted because it was the only safety I knew. We are still friends, and I do still love him (just not in a relationship way).\n\nHe moved out, I had to figure out what life was like on my own, with my dog. Being on my own felt freeing but also incredibly isolating. I had no one to fall back on anymore, just myself. I promised my friend I'd stay single for a year minimum. I'm wanting to keep to that.\n\nI started dating, I met a LOT of people. Some good, some bad, some downright abusive and manipulative. I started figuring out what I like and what I don't like.\n\nThe first guy I started seeing after my break up broke me more than my 12 year relationship. Things were going well, I thought he liked me, he was calling me pet names (red flag I know, after only 3 weeks of knowing each other) and seemed genuine in wanting to help me buy new furniture and help me move on from my ex. Then out of the blue things changed and he pulled back excessively till he just stopped talking to me. I spiralled, I was so confused. Why didn't he like me any more? What had I done wrong? I was inconsolable to my friends. I eventually got over it, but only with other people.\n\nThis was a rinse and repeat with many other people, I'd get so emotionally attached because I just wanted comfort and be surprised when they'd pack up or imply that they didn't like me any more. I just wanted consistency. I just wanted someone to like me, for me.\n\nI've been rejected more times this year than I've ever had in my life. It stings a little bit less every time but it still lingers. I've had so many great dates, so many highs of feeling like I've connected genuinely to someone only for them to just leave me in the lurch.\n\nThe worst experience I ever had was someone who I genuinely thought was lovely, they gave me gifts - they took time to see me (several times a week - up to 3-4 times which again is a red flag), they complimented me and took me on really nice dates. They were also unfortunately very emotionally unstable and I had to manage their excessive mood swings like crazy and it got to a head where I had invited them to a wedding (red flag on my end ;\\_\\_;) and they confessed that they loved me after only knowing me for 3 months. I felt trapped, I was very drunk and I knew I had to say it back or I'd have to manage their mood swings at my cousins wedding. Eventually I had enough and they unironically cut it off with me first via text and I just never replied. Dusted my hands of it and wanted to move on.\n\nAnd then after a few weeks of no contact they started bombarding me with the most insanely nasty messages, telling me I was an awful person, calling me excessively late at night and threatening to come to my house to confront me for \"ghosting\" them (when he had literally told me it wasn't working out over text). I was terrified this man could kill me, I locked down my entire house, brought my dog inside and had a frying pan next to my bed just in case. It was probably one of the scariest moments of my life. I feel like I've developed trauma from this and I'm STILL dealing with it.\n\nI go on dates with people and I am starting to be scared of the outcomes specifically post first/second date, what if they don't like me? What if I said or did something wrong? I went on a date last week that I thought was so genuine. We flirted all night, he seemed very interested in me, we talked about a lot of different topics and it felt... wholesome. It felt good. The next day nothing. I haven't heard a peep even after letting them know how nice the date was and that we should go on a date again. They're still watching my stories but haven't opened my message and it kind of broke me a little.\n\nI had a breakdown to my friend asking why no one has been consistent, or why these people seem so genuine but don't seem interested back. Or at least, not in that way. Am I not worthy of love? I am my sincere self in ALL things. I don't believe I should \"hide\" any part of myself to someone for their benefit. I wear my heart on my sleeve. Does this repulse people? It is exhausting. I feel bankrupt.\n\nI tie myself up in people and It's really hard to let go. I fantasize about them even before I even get to know them. That is something I am trying to work on but when i'm trapped inside my brain I feel so stuck. My friends say I am worthy of love, that I am funny and charming and genuine. I see how my friends love their partners and I can't help but feel a tinge of jealousy. I feel like my relationship with my ex wasn't filled with romance the way I really wanted it to. I made cards, I gave gifts, I gave everything. He wasn't really into that stuff and I just felt a bit defeated by it.\n\nI am trying to work on myself first and foremost, my best friend has said I've achieved so much this year living on my own for the first time, being independent, forging my own path without having to put others first. But it's hard. I genuinely do want to find someone who will like me for me. And I don't know where I am going. Dating feels like sorting through the shit and still getting shit when i think I've found a genuine person. They're all the same.\n\nI still want to date, It's given me more self confidence about myself than I've ever had, that maybe I am attractive and nice and caring and people see that. The highs and lows are just incredibly crippling and I feel lost.\n\nTL;DR - Dated for 12 years, was in an open/poly relationship, didn't work out. My ex moved out, has a girlfriend and I'm struggling to find someone consistent to hang with, have fun and have a genuine connection. Feel like I'll never find someone genuine.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Attending classes and performances together has always reinforced that belief for me.

For her, intimacy is tied more directly to sex — so for her, Shibari is non-sexual and just about letting the rigger provide a unique physical experience.
