His wife (a psychiatrist) is her close friend, and they both felt I was the only man they knew who fit her values — genuine, family-minded, tall, funny, reliable.

I really love her and the only reason we'd split is because of the distance, in every other way she's perfect. \nI would love some other view points on this.\nI would like to add that everyone keeps saying that since we're still young it doesn't really matter and we'll find someone else so that adds to my doubt. \nAnyway thank you in advance for the advice.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

[16M & 15F]\n\nUpdate to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/s/FzIAb78Ud8\n\nPosting this again because I accidentally messed up the text order 😭\n\nWhat she said: \n\nyep, i do want to break up. but before that let me just let you know about my feelings which i wasn’t able to communicate before. maybe they don’t matter now, but let’s just do it. so basically, why i want to break up might not be valid, but i’m pretty sure it will result in us getting less hurt. yes, it might be a permanent heartbreak, but i’m sure we’ll heal.\n\nso it’s because i want to stop both of us from being hurt. another way was changing myself, which, realistically speaking, i just can’t. i did reflect on the things you said about me, like how the things i do are red flags, that i don’t prioritize, manipulate, don’t speak about my feelings, and stuff like that. you also mentioned i’m emotionally immature which alright, i’ll take all that. i did mind you saying that to me because i would never do that, but hey, we both are different and that’s totally okay.\n\nnow all of these are points that i’m keeping in my head and will try to improve myself for basically myself. i didn’t realize i was all that, but now that i’m self-aware, i’ll try my best to make myself better.\n\nwith that, i know both of us felt like we’re caged. i felt like i didn’t have any free will to do anything, and everything felt extremely controlling and toxic. it also shattered me to the core when you said that me not being able to open up easily and being uncomfortable is a “skill issue,” which i don’t know if you’re aware of, but it’s low key messed up to say something like that to someone, but anyway, that’s on you.\n\neven though i forgave you for raising your voice at me, it really is a lesson for me because you did say you’d be gentle with me, as that was the only thing i wanted from you. i understand you got frustrated, but genuinely think, if you were in my place, would you not choose someone gentle over everything?\n\ni’m sorry for being hard to communicate with and for the stress i’ve caused you. with that, you’ve always stopped me from interacting with everyone, and yeah, you’re going to think that what you were doing was right for me. it might be or might not, but it was still strange.\n\nthere were a lot of things that bothered me too, but i didn’t talk about it at the time so i forgot. and yes, i did know you were not okay with the “protecting myself” thing, but it was just for my own self so i wouldn’t get hurt easily. it did work well. you would say i don’t care, but it really is about that. after that argument everything felt so different that i had to do this. it did save me from caring about every single detail and overthinking about it. it’ll also help me move on easily, and i think it’s something positive.\n\ni did care and love you, and it was always genuine. even when you used to doubt, assume, or criticize me on stuff, i still did and all of it was real. so if you thought it was fake, well, it never was and that’s a promise. sometimes i did feel like the love i’m showing you might be a waste because at the end you’re going to say it’s fake, but anyway, it’s never a waste whether it’s appreciated or not.\n\nall of that is fine. again, i’m sorry for the damage i’ve done. so yep, that’s about it. i still have to leave, even if things get fixed or not. so that’s about what was on my side.\n\n\nWhat I said: \n\nalright thanks for letting me know. as i predicted, there are a bunch of misunderstandings in this too. even though theres no point in explaining right now, i still will. and \"i'll still leave even if we fix things\" doesnt make sense since theres no actual reason to leave then but anyways thats your preference. \n\nso again, breaking up is just wasting what we have when we can make each other \"heal\" in a more positive way. i already explained this before, and its self explanatory. the things i said about you, how some things you do are red flags, you're emotionally immature, and all that, i said it so you could realise and change that stuff about yourself for us, because i care about you. i never meant it in a discriminatory way, again, it was to help you realise. because in a relationship, the couple is supposed to change each other to be compatible and they will if they truly love each other, thats how love works. and yeah, you can take this as a lesson to improve yourself, not for \"myself\" though, but for the next person you date. because your points are 100% valid and you have every right to do what you want. these things that me and you have talked about are only necessary in relationships, because both partners have equal rights and are supposed to work together. \n\ni get how everything felt controlling and you felt trapped. but you wouldn't have if you realised why i did what i did. if i left you to he with my female friend who liked me and tried to make us break up, you would have taken it way differently, realistically. and i dont remember saying the \"skill issue\" thing, and i would never say that. but if i did, it was obviously not meant in that direction. i probably meant to say that it means you just need to improve the skill or whatever.\n\nand yeah, i would want someone to be gentle with me. but i dont think i would expect them to be gentle all the time, especially if i dont communicate with them and make them frustrated. so yeah being frustrated and sometimes mad in a situation like this is perfectly normal in my opinion. i never stopped you from interacting with everyone. i stopped you from interacting with red flag guys who are a danger to us. if we didnt deal with the other guy a few months ago, this exact thing would have happened that time, i know very well, and i predicted this. and no i didnt do it because its good for \"you\" i did it because it was good for \"us\" and the protecting myself thing is extremely wrong lol. it shows you never cared about how i felt since the start. and yes it is indeed selfish. if you wanted to not be attached, you should have just broken up then, why waste my time. and again, breaking up is NOT positive lol, especially when we have an option to fix it and prevent stuff like this from happening in the future. but khair everyone has their own preferences. for you, you like to micro cheat in relationships and have extremely wrong relations with guys, so understandable that we both may not allign.\n\nand yes i did doubt your love, and i still do. because what you did to me and what you're doing RIGHT NOW proves your love was always uneven. leaving me for a guy who disrespects us and who likes you. its obvious what your intentions are lol, im not dumb. anyways thats on you and what you want to do. but again, it lowkey pisses me off how you think this is the right thing to do instead of again, fixing things. tbh, love never works like this. at ALL. because arguments are normal. and if you can't handle one and aren't willing to fix one, then im afraid you'll just keep breaking up with people i guess. i don't know if you will even date anyone or not but doesnt matter. \n\nthanks for letting me know about all this now. tbh you should have said all this before so i could explain and again, maybe actually fix this. since these are all misunderstanding, or shifted mindset stuff. but yeah anyways i'll always value our relationship and what we had. thanks again for opening up.\n\nHer points seemed really invalid to me, and most of them were misunderstandings she kept in her mind. \n\nThanks again to everyone who supported in the previous post. You all helped me get the motivation to stand up and do the right thing. This was extremely hard for me, and it feels like i've lost a piece of my life, because i genuinely loved her a lot, and invested so much time and energy in her.. and we planned our future together, our marriage, our university, everything. but this made me learn my lesson: always set boundaries before dating. We both are in an online school where we students have no way of talking to each other, but we both were able to meet by a miracle and she was the only one i knew who was in my class. So now it feels really empty and lonely without even an academic partner, my birthday is also coming up in a week, and she had so much stuff planned for me, and we have lots of stuff to share with each other, so doing this at this time especially hurt a lot.. but hey it was for the best. \n\nThank you again!", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

I noticed that he had liked some of her posts, but only the ones where she was scantily clothed or provocative. It really bothered me, especially because he liked those posts while we were already in a relationship. I honestly wouldn’t mind if he had liked them before we got together.\n\nThe thing is, I’m already exhausted from bringing up similar issues. Once, I saw that he had commented on a mutual friend's thirst trap photo. I tried to ask him about it calmly, hoping for an open and honest conversation. But instead, he got upset and defensive. He said he commented because he “loved his friend’s boobs” (yes, he literally said something like that). Later, he claimed it was just a joke, but still… why joke about something like that?\n\nI was so tired of trying to explain how it made me feel disrespected. He kept brushing it off, telling me I was being silly or overreacting. Eventually, I stopped replying, and we didn’t talk for a week. We did talk it out later, and I thought I had moved past it. But now, seeing that he’s still liking other girls’ suggestive posts on Instagram has triggered me again.\n\nI know I should bring it up, but I’m just so tired of him getting defensive every time.\n\nAnother thing that adds to my insecurity is that he actively look for female friends and never post about me, not even once. (He only posted me once before, when we were just friends, and I didn’t even know because it was on his close friends story.) I love him so much, and I do believe he loves me too, but the things he does or doesn't do make me question myself. It hurts that he doesn’t seem to consider my feelings in these “little things.”\n\nI used to be really anxious about the things I couldn’t see or didn’t know about. But I’ve come to accept that it’s out of my control, whatever happens, happens. Still, when I’m feeling unstable, all of it comes back to me, and sometimes I feel the urge to end things.

I’m pretty much stuck in a situationship. He told me about 6 months ago that if we were to be together it would take maybe 1-2 years because he was unsure of where he’s at in his life or what to do with it. He told me he didn’t think that was fair to me but that he really liked me but wouldn’t want to hold me back or stop me from meeting someone in my own country as he lives at least a 12h flight away from me…\n\nAbout a month ago he hit me with a bombshell when I asked him what we are… he told me he wasn’t looking for a relationship and was enjoying being single but if he wanted a relationship I would be his only choice (whatever that means). I admit I was really upset and shocked at him changing his mind, I felt like I wasn’t good enough but he tried to reassure me that this wasn’t the case and that he had commitment issues (despite being married before ??) he told me he made the mistake of treating ‘us’ as if we were in a relationship and he shouldn’t have done that.\n\nLately he’s been acting differently towards me, shutting me out more, not acting the way he normally would with me - short, blunt replies etc, lately he’s been ignoring quite a few of my messages to the point I feel like I’m begging him to make the effort to speak to me. I told him I had made my mind up to date other guys and he said ‘if you feel like you’re ready then go for it, I hope you find the right one.’ So I said ‘only one way to find out, you’re a good friend to me, maybe one day you will find out’ and he said ‘I’ll always be here to listen to you’ \n\nThen he started acting weird again so last night I asked ‘is this the way things are going to be now? Did I say something wrong when I said about dating other guys’ he told me he didn’t care but didn’t have anything else to say about it and it blew up into an argument.\n\nHe said if I’m going to act like this he won’t speak to me again so I said if that’s what he wants then that’s his choice and he started asking if I was serious about us not talking and I said yes if he didn’t want to speak to me anymore he can be honest and we can end whatever this is. He told me he didn’t mean what he said and he doesn’t want us to stop talking. I told him I feel like I’m too emotionally invested in this and he’s not and he agreed with me. So I’m genuinely confused by all of this. \n\nNow he’s apologised and said he’s giving me time and space to figure out what I want and where I want to go from here which has really confused me because I’ve always been open about how I feel about him and that I wanted to meet him in person and see if we could start a relationship which is something at the start of us talking, he was open to but now he’s completely against it. He doesn’t want me, but he doesn’t want to let me go?? What is there to figure out… I want him, he doesn’t want to commit to me. \n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute he acts as if we are in a committed relationship i.e we made an agreement not to do anything sexual or even touch ourselves unless we were both doing it, things like that which hint to being in a relationship then I ask him what we are or talk about my feelings and he shuts it down. \n\nTL:Dr had a big argument with my LD ‘situationship’ who told me he won’t speak to me again if I keep acting this way then retracted that statement and told me he’s giving me space to figure things out when I want him, he doesn’t want me.

We stayed together into college, and now as freshmen our relationship has gotten really intense and honestly toxic.\n\nShe tells me often that I don’t understand her, that I left her waiting, that I made her into her worst version, and that I trapped her in pain. She also says the only time she feels truly happy is when we’re physically together.

For most of it, we lived together. But in mid-July, he went back to his hometown, and since then, everything has changed.\n\nThe last time he actually called me was August 4th.

Because his parents are strict and he’s preparing for government exams, I can’t call him either. But before he left, I had told him very clearly that communication is important to me, especially in a long-distance relationship. Still, nothing changed.\n\nAbout nine days ago, I finally sent him a very long text. I poured out all my feelings, explained how much it hurts, and told him what I wanted in a long-distance relationship. I told him I can’t go days without talking on the phone. He replied with a long paragraph too, assuring me he’d start calling twice a week (normal calls). That gave me hope.\n\nThen Monday came. He texted me asking if he could call, but I was in an online class, so I said, “Can we talk in 30 minutes?” He said it was difficult for him to call and that he would call tomorrow. I agreed.\n\nTuesday — nothing happened. No call, no messages explaining why he couldn’t call. Wednesday passed — nothing. Thursday too — nothing. I waited, but it felt like he wasn’t even trying.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, I couldn’t take it anymore. I sent him a breakup message, saying that this long-distance isn’t working and it’s best to end the relationship. He asked me why, but I just said I didn’t want to go into details. He replied, “Okay.”\n\nThat night, I sent one last message. I told him I was angry, that holding on was hurting me too much, and that I had no choice but to let him go. He just said, “If you’re 100% sure, then okay, I’ll let you go as well.”\n\nI tried not to continue the conversation after that, but I couldn’t help myself. I asked him how he could let me go so easily. He replied that if I was very sure about breaking up, then he had to let me go. He added that maybe when he asked me why I was angry, I should have told him instead of staying vague. He said it wasn’t easy for him either, but honestly, his actions didn’t show that. Even after this, he didn’t try to call me or ask what exactly happened, why I was angry, or why I was breaking up.\n\nHis words were basically: “If you’re 100% sure about the breakup, then I don’t want to force you to stay with me. I have to let you go because asking again won’t change anything.”\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nNow I’m stuck questioning everything. Did I make the right choice? Is this normal?

She lives outside the EU, I live in the EU. We’ve only met once for a week, but we talk and text every day. I love her very much and can see a future with her, including marriage.\n\nShe says we should marry now just to have the document, since in her country it can take up to a year after the wedding to even get a visa appointment. Her idea is: we marry now, and once I have a stable job and a place to live, we apply for the visa and truly start our life together.\n\nBut despite this, I don’t feel good about it. I just recently finished my training/education and haven’t found a job yet. I don’t feel prepared to go into a marriage “empty-handed,” without employment or income. I told her that I want to first find a stable job and get through the 6-month probation period, so I can enter the marriage with more self-confidence. She says that once she comes to my country she also wants to work, but I still feel a lot of pressure, and for me it all feels too fast.\n\nThe problem is, I’ve already agreed to marriage multiple times to avoid conflict and because I was afraid of losing her. Each time I thought: “I’ll manage it somehow.” But whenever it got serious, I realized deep down that I wasn’t ready.\n\nNow my girlfriend has lost patience because the wedding has been postponed multiple times. She even says now that it’s already “too late” and that we should have married long ago. This makes me feel even more pressured, and instead of looking forward to marriage, I feel stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nSo I’m torn: On one hand, I love her and don’t want to lose her. On the other hand, I know I’m not ready, and marrying without a stable foundation would give me a very bad feeling.\n\nHow would you see this?

We called almost every day, and at one point we even talked about meeting in person. But between the war in her country, my struggles with getting a visa, and the fact that I quit my job a few months ago, things got complicated.\n\nOver time, she started pulling away — fewer texts, no more calls. Whenever I brought up meeting, she’d avoid the topic or get annoyed. The only explanation she ever gave was that she’s still a student, introverted, and doesn’t really know how to handle everything. She also said that if we met, it had to be in her city (Moscow) and nowhere else, since she felt safer that way.\n\nI probably made things worse by oversharing — telling her that visas were harder to get than I expected, that it might take longer, and that I had just left my job. Her response was basically, “It’s fine, it won’t be this year, maybe the next.” I stayed hopeful. I even sent her flowers before, and at some point I promised her I would come. But she never wanted to talk about how we’d actually make it happen, and I felt like I was the only one pushing for it.\n\nEventually, I confronted her and said: *“It feels like you’re not interested in meeting or even talking about how we could make it work. It seems like the whole topic just bothers you — and it makes me think you don’t really care that much.”*\n\nShe read it but never replied. That was a month ago.

Again I’m not saying I’m not gonna put effort in but I care for her in my own way and in my own time . Is that so wrong? And literally sometimes I don’t understand her myself sometimes .

Like i genuinely don’t like the ‘reading between the lines concept’ especially during situations like this because it’s HEATED if it’s a casual situation then that’s fine but this is different. (Really thinking of ending it honestly , I just don’t think our dynamic can survive , she wants constant attention whilst I’m trying to work 50-60 hour weeks for her . And if I’m not giving her attention then I’m full on ignoring her and if she’s ill and I’m not saying a single word to her then that means i don’t care at all . I don’t hold her to that same standard so I’m just confused , I remember the amount of times I’ve been ill and I’ve gone to sleep , I didn’t wake up to any text about wishing me better health . I’m not trying to be petty but I’m just confused . I’m trying to understand her and just get closer and closer to her but it’s not working honestly and she knows it and I just feel like I’m not enough honestly .", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SILENCE_GAP"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We had a great time: dates, kissing, cuddling, lots of flirting, sending each other reels, she even mentioned me to her family. She often said she really liked me and complimented my personality, looks and the way I treated her.\n\nBut from the start, she asked me if I was a cheater and sometimes said things like “you’re lying, I’ll find out your lies.” She has been cheated on by her exes, so she has strong trust issues. I think she worries that because I’m confident, good-looking and know how to flirt, I’ll eventually cheat on her.\n\nA few days ago, I went out clubbing, got drunk and had no signal – so I didn’t text her. The next day she switched completely: accusing me of lying, saying she doesn’t believe I could be loyal, and that she has a “bad gut feeling.”\n\nShe now says it won’t work, that she listens to her gut, but she hasn’t unfollowed or removed me anywhere. I know she liked me – but her insecurity and fear of betrayal seem stronger than her feelings.\n\nI had the idea of writing her a short letter as a last try, because once we joked about “if we ever fight and stop talking, I’ll write you letters.” She told me she actually wants that, that she wants someone to fight for her.\n\nIt finally ended because after 3 days of cold shoulder, I asked her to meet in person to talk. She refused, so I said: *“then I guess this is it.”*\n\nMy question: should I try this one last time (write her the letter asking to talk once more), or should I just let it go and move on?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I stopped by for a few but I couldn't get the weekend off because I had work.\n\n(There was a pool party last weekend too that I attended, since people at her job work around the clock, and everyone wanted to come to one, so I showed up to that one and worked the grill. Had a blast)\n\nAnyways, she ends up drinking too much, and starts making out with another girl, while sitting on her lap and telling her she's gonna take care of her children and wants a future with her.\n\nThe girl that she was sitting on, grinding on, and kissing on, her boyfriend shows up and he's pissed. He pours a drink on the girl my girlfriend is sitting on, makes a scene, and then leaves.\n\nI don't know this yet, and I get off of work and head straight there, texting her that I'm on the way and I will be there soon, and she says, \"Yayy\". \n\nI show up to the house, and something was off, because this coworker she was kissing on and flirting with while on her lap was being very, very nice to me. (Normally she doesn't even talk to me).\n\nI take them both in my truck to the waffle house to get them some food, they hold hands across the parking lot, and spend most of the time hanging on each other while I drove them around. They were giggling and giving off bad signs to me because I really try to be appropriate around social settings, but I hate when my girlfriend is a little flirty when she's drunk, especially touchy to other people. (She does this a lot).\n\nSo, I get them back to the house and we set down the food to eat at the kitchen table. This coworker of hers slaps my girlfriends butt and she giggles and says, \"yeah do you like that?\" \n\nI got pretty tired of it, and when I sat down, I put my hand on my girlfriends thigh for some physical comfort. She pushed my hand off and said, \"Don't!\", then continued eating. \n\nAnyways, I go home, I dont even want to spend the night and I decided to do some reconnaissance. I call and talk to the guy who poured a drink on the girl she was flirting with and kissing on. He told me everything he saw.\n\nI was freaking out, I had anxiety because I really really love her. A little bit about me is that I've always knew that if my relationship ended, with anyone, that I could be with someone again. With this girl, I dont want to be with anyone but her. So again, I was scared when it came to this information, and had a panic attack while at my house. The only person to comfort me is her, so I drove back over and got into bed with her. She was sleeping, reeked of alcohol and I just couldn't even look at her. So, in full panic attack mode, I got back in my truck, took two benadryl and slept for only 5 hrs. \n\nWhen I woke up my girlfriend was at work, and I gave her a call the MOMENT I woke up. I asked if everything was true and she said, \"I was just trying to think of a way to tell you.\"\n\nSo, yeah, she cheated on me. She's regretful, and very very apologetic, saying she is gonna quit alcohol, acknowledging abusive patterns towards me, all of it.

She said at the time she hadn’t felt seen, mothered me which I disagree with, trapped. \n\nWe both saw other people during the breakup but did not sleep with them and made us both realize we were happy with each other. We got back together almost a month ago and talked about us laying out finances, house plan, kid plan, marriage, engagement. Everything was looking up and we decided to get a dog even though we have 3 cats and she told me when we got back together she is in it for the long haul, marriage etc. she said I’ve changed and I am the perfect guy.\n\nFlash forward to last night she told me that she’s not breaking up with me but she is feeling trapped because she said I rushed her to get back together when I gave her her space I moved out temporarily for 2 weeks, let her do her own thing, we went to dinner the Sunday before we got back together it was nice, came home and made love I went back to my place because she said it felt like a mistake/rushed. Then told me an hour later to come back over because it was cold in the bed without me, from this point on it was like we were dating again all week and the Sunday after dinner and everything we attended church and got back together and got the dog the next Saturday, we have been attending church every Sunday since.\n\nToday we talked after she was off of work and she told me she needs her space and doesn’t know what to do because I am the “perfect guy” I changed everything I did that she hated before the breakup, and I have been selfless and she isn’t sure why mentally she is like this. I told her during our breakup how I felt, where I stood if we got back together.

{"id": "u/sunflowerbubbles123_1169", "user": "u/sunflowerbubbles123", "text": "Leaving my boyfriend of 5 years\n\nI wrote this today about my current situation. I think writing it down helps a little bit but just wanted to share here in case anyone has the time to read. Any advice or opinions are welcome :)\n\nI (26 F) am breaking up with my boyfriend (26 M) of 5 years, which we lived together for all of those years. We started dating my senior year of college and now we’re both 26. From the start there were signs I should’ve been wary of but I chose to ignore them. I’m about to say some reasons throughout our relationship that led me to this decision but he is not all bad, he’s broken, but has a good heart. Here we go..\n\nHe has never liked any of my friends, or anyone really, besides his family. Mid-college he quit weed, got sick, got behind in his classes, dropped out, cut off his friends, and then I guess found me. Since then, it’s only been me and his family, which I don’t think is healthy.\n\nWhen we first got together I thought he was still in school. For the first 6 months I would say things like, “you never have homework,” and he’d just say he already did it. But we were together almost all the time, so that didn’t make sense. Eventually he admitted he had dropped out. Around then I also brought him around my college friends—he barely said a word, gave me nothing to work with, and I finally told him he could leave. He did, though we reconciled that night.\n\nMy friends are so important to me. I’m an only child and they’ve always been like my family. They’re great people, with kind hearts, and they always show up for me. But his inability to connect or even be nice to them has been a huge issue. We tried several trips with them where I hoped he’d bond with the boyfriends, but he always ended up mad at me for something small, blowing up my phone with complaints, and wishing we could just leave instead of hanging out with the group.\n\nOne of the worst times was 2 years ago in Miami for a friend’s wedding. The first day he was fine, but the next he got upset, saying “why do they get to make all the decisions?” I’m very go with the flow, so that kind of stuff doesn’t bother me, but he made it into a fight. At dinner he started sulking again when asked to take photos of us, acted annoyed, and then shut me out—just one word answers and wouldn’t even look at me. It was so obvious and embarrassing. He refused to go out that night and the rest of the trip he kept the same attitude.\n\nThis kind of thing happened over and over. Even after college, anytime there was a get-together—Super Bowl, Halloween, anything—he always had excuses not to go. Meanwhile, I was working full time and he didn’t have a job, just school. But he wasn’t studying, he was just playing video games.\n\nAnother issue is his extreme OCD. If I left anything out, even for a second, he would get angry. I know it’s a real condition and I’ve tried so hard to be more organized, but I also have ADHD and it’s not always easy. Still, no matter how much I tried, it was never enough.\n\nWe also never went on dates. He hated going out because of anxiety and depression. I always wanted to get out of the house and enjoy new experiences together, but he didn’t want to.\n\nOver time, I’ve lost myself. In the last city we lived in (which he constantly complained about), I paid rent for both of us while he finished school. When we moved back near family, I thought it would get better. He did finally get a job, but the fights only got worse. I became depressed, and he blamed me for being less happy, saying I was “killing the mood.”\n\nFights would escalate to him saying things like “we’re done,” “get out,” or “I wish I had a girlfriend who cared about what I like.” Meanwhile, he never cared about anything of mine. I was just exhausted.\n\nStill, he is like a best friend. He knows me better than anyone, and I know he loves me. But he only ever changes for a few days before going back to the same patterns. I realized I couldn’t see myself marrying him or being happy long term.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I signed a lease. I was planning to tell him after a bachelorette trip, but the day before we got into another fight and I blurted it out. He was upset, then sad, then understanding. When I got back, things were heavy, but this past week he’s been kind and trying to make our last days together good. He’s broken down crying, telling me I’m the love of his life, and I do believe that I am to him.\n\nI love him so much, but I can’t do this anymore. It kills me knowing I’m taking most of the furniture from the house, leaving him in an empty space. I’ll miss him terribly, and I’ll miss his family—being an only child with older parents and no extended family, I loved how welcoming and warm they were.\n\nBut after 5 years, I know I need to try to find myself again. I feel awful, and I keep second guessing myself, but deep down I think it’s the right choice. Even if it breaks my heart. I don’t know if this is right. It just all feels so heavy.\n\nMy question is: Should I fully move on and close this chapter for good, or should I leave the door open for the possibility of trying again in the future after we’ve both had time to grow separately? If my goal is to heal, grow, and eventually have a healthy long-term relationship (whether with him or with someone else), what should I do next?\n\nTLDR: I (26F) am ending a 5-year relationship with my boyfriend (26M). He never connected with my friends, avoided social events, and often picked fights. His OCD, anxiety, and depression made daily life hard—we never went on dates, and despite my effort it was never enough. I supported us financially while he was in school, but things didn’t improve after he got a job. The fights and negativity wore me down, and I realized I couldn’t see a future with him. I love him and his family deeply, but I need to leave to find myself again, even though it breaks my heart. My question: Should I focus on moving forward and letting go, or should I consider the idea of trying again in the future after time apart?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

But I am seriously debating leaving him - I am fed up.\n\nWe have been long-distance for about 3 years, and he's now going to continue on his course for another 3 years. We barely talk and see each other, and I seem to be the one making all the effort. I have a decent job and I don't want to leave it, I recently re-located for this job (we used to see each other if we were in our home towns at the same time) but recently he's refused to stay mine when I am down, I understand that its not great sleeping on a blow-up bed, but his house stinks and is disgustingly filthy (I wont shower there bc I fell dirtier after a shower there) - yet he'd still rather stay there, which means I don't see my family for as long or my pets when I come and visit bc I am staying at his.\n\nWe had a falling out on our 4-year anniversary, bc I took time off work to go up and see him, he told me just before I was going to leave to not take my holiday days as he was too busy with coursework. So I went up just on the weekend instead. I asked him to book dinner and to plan a day, and to pay, as I had brought him gifts and he didn't get me anything. On our anniversary, he lay in bed saying he didn't feel well, so we didn't do anything for our anniversary, and it felt like I had wasted a lot of money as he just spent our time in bed, and when he did go and do his coursework, it consisted of scrolling through what seemed to be Instagram reels and discord then maybe some work. To top it off, his roommate offered to make me food, I refused and waited for my bf to come downstairs, which then I was offered a truce of a dominoes pizza, which I couldn't keep down as I had been waiting for him all day and hadnt eaten anything other than apples in the fridge which he told me were rotten after I had eaten them.\n\nWe've had arguments over him not speaking to me as well, he has acknowledged that a message from him is all that I want and its just a way that I know he knows I'm still here ya know, we used to call in the evenings but he doesn't like it as we have different sleeping patterns and he didn't like it and being stuck on call with me as I slept. And I used to get annoyed if he hung up. But I have stopped that now. i also went through a massive issue of idk where he was and what he was doing till he was out doing it - which is what mainly ruined the call time, which was very important to me at the time, as it eats the only time I got to hear his voice and hear about his day if it consisted more of \"not much\" which I regret now but I did use to stalk him a bit just to see what he was doing, bc he wouldn't tell me.\n\nonto our most recent, idk what to call it. I message him every morning, if I forget, I may send a message in the evening (and if I have missed a day like i slept through a weekend before I apologised and told him why I didn't message him) my message consists of saying 'good morning babe' And I typically get a message at 1 pm saying 'hey' - he had not messaged me for a whole day even though his Instagram said he had been online through multiple intervals during the day, he then messaged me the next day saying 'hey' no sorry or explanation. so I have been letting him initiate the conversation - I want to make it clear that I haven't been ignoring him, just letting him message me first. he than asked me if I was okay and he hadn't heard from me, which I then told him I was fuming over the fact he didn't message me and I needed a few days to think, he has now said that 'so the best option was to make the situation worse and not talk to me about it?' which he does have a point. But I am completely fed up. i will also add that he is ignoring all of my messages, as he has read a few of them and has hung up on me, trying to call him twice.\n\nI don't understand why he can 'take time to think' but I can't?\n\nIt also feels like I am the only one who cares, puts effort and cries over the relationship, while he goes unbothered.\n\nHe has been fixing my PC (it is fixed now), and I plan on going home, picking it up, telling him I'm done, as he starts his course again, and I think this would be the best time for both of us to start fresh. He can find a new girl who can deal with not being spoken to, and I can find someone who wants to talk to me. Then spend the rest of my weekend with my family.\n\nAm I over reacting?

She’s good with me in many ways, but I feel like I’m always the one trying to keep her happy, and depending on her mood, that ends up deciding how our day goes.\n\nI still love her, but I can’t lie — it’s been weighing on me.

No gifts, no thoughtful gestures—until I finally blocked him for two weeks. Then suddenly... flowers showed up. After weeks of feeling unseen, dismissed, and emotionally starved, that was the only time he actually showed some kind of effort. Why does it take me disappearing to be acknowledged?\n\nWhen I go through hard times, he brushes it off. Says I’m American and should just get over it. If I try to vent, he interrupts or asks me to turn on my camera—even if I’m driving and clearly just need to be heard. There’s no empathy. No comfort.

However, sending multiples of one thing or two things seems to be possible.)\n\nI have sent 2 care packages full of things to him & also ordered things from Amazon JP and sent it to his address. I haven’t received anything physical from him as of yet & all his gifts have been virtual (in game items of a game we play). I appreciate his gifts and enjoy them, but I have also expressed that I’d like to have something physical too. My reasoning is that If the game we play decides to close their servers then I wont really have anything as a keepsake & that makes me feel sad. \n\nI do however understand that it’s difficult to send things from Japan so I’ve said that even a letter would mean the world to me (since there are no customs forms required for a letter). He said he would and that he’d try sending me multiples of one item that I mentioned I really wanted but it’s been months & nothing.\nHe also mentioned he could order things from Amazon uk and send it to my house (he has my address and knows how) but hasn’t.\n\nI kind of expected something for my birthday last week as he did mention he was looking at postage forms & since we have the same birthday month I had been planning his present since June & sent him a package full of snacks he said he wanted to try (that’d withstand the summer heat of Japan lol) & other things I thought he would need that he had mentioned & handmade gifts & self care items to help him through work stress he was struggling with. I put a lot of thought into every gift as the sentiment and thought behind a gift is what means the world to me. \nHe ended up gifting me a skin in a game we play together that I did mention looked nice before & I do appreciate it. He also made a short video of a collage of photos of us together as a virtual letter which I really liked. But a part of me was bummed at not having anything physical to have as a keepsake again. Especially since I had expressed my feelings about only receiving virtual gifts before. \nDon’t get me wrong though - the video did mean a lot to me as it felt sentimental so I expressed to him how much it meant to me & it has been the best gift so far. \n\nI don’t know. I do appreciate everything he has gifted me so I feel very selfish and ungrateful feeling this sad over this. At the same time I kind of feel unheard & don’t know how to express it to him even further. \nIt’s not like he’s not gifting me things or not putting in the effort but at the same time I also feel there is a slight lack of effort.

How do we work this out?\n\n\nWe’re in a long-distance relationship (I’m from Europe, he’s from the US). His dad is Hindu and doesn’t eat beef, so his mom doesn’t either out of respect. My boyfriend is Hindu too, but he has eaten beef before—though his dad doesn’t know, and he’d never tell him.\n\nI wasn’t raised religiously—my parents are basically atheists. I believe in God, right and wrong, and a bit in karma, but nothing strict.\n\nOur issue is about the future and raising kids. I don’t want to raise them with any strict religion, just to be good people. He wants to raise them Hindu. He doesn’t mind if I eat beef, but he doesn’t want it cooked in our house or served to our future kids. I understand his perspective, but it bothers me since it’s not my religion, and I want our home to feel like ours. It’s not my belief so I’d like to cook it occasionally for myself if it’s my home too.\n\nWhat confuses me is that he still eats beef occasionally (and likes it), but feels guilty because of his religion and parents (his dad). I don’t want our kids growing up with that same guilt. We agreed they won’t eat beef when they’re little and can decide for themselves later, but I worry his parents will interfere and cause drama. I feel like it should be our decision as a couple, not influenced by his family, and I wish he’d stand up more for that. So that’s mainly it. He is already worried about them finding out that our kids will maybe decide to eat beef later on and his dad could assume that he does too, which would lead to a huge argument. \n\nSo yes, that’s the main issue. I don’t like how he is already scared that if our future kids end up eating beef, his parents will find out. cause then his dad will assume that he eats it too (which is technically true) and there’s gonna be a huge drama. I just don’t want to live like that, hiding it just because of his parents. This is our life and it’s gonna be our little family and I think it’s none our both our parents’ business, only ours.

Some context - we met in 2023 while I was working abroad and he was on vacation visiting our mutual friend, who has since passed. He's handsome, and I think a little out of my league, if I'm honest. He hit me up when he was visiting family in my city in summer 2024, we really connected as friends and had spent some great days together, I was then in his city this summer and our relationship progressed. We started messaging and calling regularly when I returned home, and after a month or so of mostly consistent communication I booked to fly out to see him in October. Before doing this, we had a candid conversation about expectations, etc. and we were on the same page. This would be our first trip with the sole intention of seeing each other. Things were looking good, I was cautiously hopeful.\n\nNow, 3 weeks out from my trip, I think he's ghosting me. He's a busy guy, I trust that he is busier right now than he was when we decided I would come visit him, but since the beginning of this month I've barely heard from him. Last Tuesday I asked him if he still wanted me to come, he said yes and that he's just extremely busy at the moment, and I haven't heard from him since.

{"id": "u/Over-Regular8073_1771", "user": "u/Over-Regular8073", "text": "[22F/22M] - I can't stand it anymore.\n\nMe (Polish) and my Spanish boyfriend met during his Erasmus 2 years ago and became a couple. When his Erasmus finished, we started long distance because we both had to finish our bachelor’s degree. In his case - a bachelor’s is enough to get a nice job. In mine - without a master’s it’s really hard, and my family also wants me to finish my MA, which takes 2 years. My boyfriend assured me that the long distance was going to last only one year - when he finished his studies, he would come to my country again. This summer, during his stay here, we even were looking for some flats to rent. We even agreed that I could pay the rent until he found a job. But suddenly he changed his mind. He said that renting is a waste of money, that it’s better to wait and buy a flat. He also said he wouldn’t earn as much as in Spain and he was not going to stay. My heart broke in that moment. I had the happy future already pictured in my mind and suddenly everything was destroyed. I remember that time was terrible for me. I was crying almost every day and couldn’t stop. Briefly - my mental health collapsed. I started having heavy $u!c!dal thoughts etc. I was so sure he would stay. I decided not to extend the contract for the room I used to rent; because of that I had to look for a new room super fast. I didn’t apply for a master’s in his city because I was so sure he would stay here. This makes me feel like it’s all my fault we didn’t close the distance. I still blame myself.\n\nAfter some weeks I went to Spain to visit him. It was fine, but the last day of my stay was the worst of all the last days I’ve ever had. I have to mention that every time on the day of my flight home I was crying like crazy and I couldn’t calm myself down at all. However, for more or less half a year it’s been even worse. I feel like the worst shit. For me it’s like being dragged out of my safe zone. I’m completely stressed and anxious. It’s like total panic and nothing helps me. I tried some breathing or grounding exercises and even hydroxyzine, and nothing helps. So, coming back to the very last visit. Before the visit I’d already felt depressed, but after coming back I couldn’t eat, I was crying all day, even in public places because I couldn’t hold it. I just wanted to stop existing. I still feel really stressed, anxious and depressed, but now I am able to hold back my crying - or I just cried all my tears out. This week I’m seeing the doctor so he can prescribe me some medicine for my mental state.\n\nI feel so lonely and disappointed. My boyfriend is looking for a job now and probably until next year he won’t be able to come (because at the beginning it’s not possible to take days off). What’s more, in my city they are renovating the airport and it’s boing to be closed for more than a month (don’t tell me to try other airports. I can’t skip classes anymore and flying from another airport means traveling all day).\n\nI’m coming to Spain in 2 weeks. Later we can see each other at Christmas. I know some couples wait longer to see each other, but I can’t stand it anymore. In order to see each other I have to skip my birthday and Christmas in my hometown. I feel so unequal because last year he was doing an internship and I was the person who was coming (and at that time there was no direct flight. I was always so stressed with the travels). I had to reschedule my work and skip classes in order to see him. Now, I’m trying to go on Erasmus to his city for next year. I understand that in his case it’s not possible to visit me that frequently and that he works to earn for our future, but still, I think I sacrifice a lot for him and the relationship. Most of all - my mental health.\n\nI’m worried that if it happens that we break up, I will end up with nothing. He lives with his parents so he doesn’t need to pay rent unlike me. Most of what he earns he saves. His mental health is more than fine.  \nI don’t know what to do. I just can’t stand it. I don’t even have anybody to hug me during this hard time. There is no finishing date. Everything is uncertain. If I won't make it to Erasmus we will have to be in LDR for another 2 years. I'm enough of it. I don't want to finish the relationship because I love him but I dont know what to do because it kills me.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We haven’t spent time/spoken in a while, and he feels like i deserve more. He feels lonely because of the distance, and with everything happening feels like he needs less on his plate. We were seriously ending things, then called and ended up not breaking up. We don’t want to split but i want what’s best for him. Currently not able to see each other due to financial issues on both ends. Unsure what to do.\n\napologies for the essay, i tried to summarize it as much as i could\n\nWe met online through a video game (i had just turned 19, he was 18 for a few months, born in same year), and we never intended to have something online, but we truly fell for each other. We had our ups and downs, doubts here and there, but we have not once broken up. We’ve only taken one break for about 2-3 weeks(both tried to not text the other), but have stayed together because we want something serious.\n\nNow to the issue- we haven’t really spoken too much or really spent that much time together or even spoken much/called in a month- a month and a half, and i figured he wanted more space and just didn’t know it (thought this because that was the reasoning for the previous break, he was under a lot of stress). But he came to me saying that he thinks we should end things, he’s under a lot of pressure from family issues, financial issues, personal issues, and it hurts him that i can’t be there to comfort him. \n\nHe said he wishes i was there because he wants physical touch, and for someone to comfort him. That it hurts him because he misses me so much but he can’t even hold me (it’s been a problem in the past). And with everything going on with him he feels like he needs less off his plate, just so he doesn’t have to worry about it as much.\n\nHe feels as though he’s not good enough for me, as i value quality time, and there’s been a few times where i had gotten upset because we wouldn’t spend as much time together. He feels like he’s holding me back from finding someone better, but i always told him that despite everything he’s a good guy and genuinely treats me well, and a bunch of things i love about him that makes him better than others. Even during arguments he has never called me names or said terrible things.\n\nAs much as i hated the idea of losing him (we are really attached to each other) i chose to respect his decision and even though i wanted to beg him to stay, i decided not to. He told me this over text, and he sounded serious about it. He said even though we are broken up, we’ll still have each others phone numbers to text each other every now and then, because he can’t imagine just throwing me away and never talking to me again. So i asked him if we could call for the last time before we do.\n\nAt first he sounded sure about it all, but after everything he said he had a “wtf am i doing” moment, and realized he doesn’t want to lose me. He doesn’t want to end things, if anything take a break, but he still doesn’t want to do that. I’m still not 100% sure where he stands, we planned to talk about it later today too. At the end of the call it sounded like we weren’t splitting up, we went from crying to even laughing a little. Hearing my voice again apparently reminded him that what we have is real and genuine.\n\nThing is, i genuinely don’t want to lose him. I love him with all my heart. I can’t imagine my life without him because he’s such an important part of my day, even when we barely talk. But i thought about if he’s constantly worrying about me/us, it might not be the best thing for him. He says he genuinely loves me and i always will have a special place in his heart. And as much as it hurts me i want the best for him. Even when it sounded like we were done he truly wanted what was best for me, he wanted me to do things to help myself.\n\nCurrently because of everything we haven’t been able to see each other. We are both struggling financially and simply don’t have the money to see each other, although we really want to. I offered to contribute to his flight and hotel and maybe even pay for one or the both fully when im able to, but he doesn’t feel like i should be paying for everything, because he wants to be able to do things together and buy me stuff/spoil me (we “fight” about this lol, i want to spoil him too).\n\nI thought about a few options:\n-break up completely, which seems really scary and extreme\n\n-taking a break until one of us either can’t take it, or is ready to make a decision if we stay or separate \n\n-taking a break until his situation is better\n\n-slightly limit contact, maybe video call once 1-2 weeks to update each other, and so we can see each others faces/hear our voices more regularly and to remember what we have\n \n-keep somewhat our current situation and text when we feel like it, so we don’t feel alone\n\nwhat should we do? i’ve thought about bringing up option 4 to him, but i would like to hear other people’s opinions or other possible choices", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I feel very uncomfortable by this, i dont like becoming sexualized just by eating or feeling the uncomfortable feeling of being bloated.\n\nWe tried to “water bloat” and i hated it. I feel disgusting and uncomfortable yet he tries to push it on me at least once a month. I also feel like he wants me to get larger and I do not.\n\nWhen i say no he gets sad and says im not fulfilling his needs. Am i not enough?\n\nto add context, he has been addicted to porn and this also bleeds into our relationship.\n\nI really do care about him but i don’t know how to tell him that i feel sexually coerced. but i also personally don’t think this is a means of breakup.\n\nWhat should i do?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We lost contact during COVID for about 4-5 years, but started reconnecting recently, and we've now been dating for almost 3 months. Things were great at first, barely any arguments or problems. But lately, things have been getting harder, especially with both of our mental health struggles.\n\nI have BPD, depression, hearing loss, and recently came out of an academic burnout. He has depression, ADHD, insomnia, and hypersomnia (yes, somehow both). Recently, he's been sleeping worse, if sleeping at all, and I've been spiralling more into depression, which also makes my BPD worse.\n\nToday, while we were on a call, I couldn't hear what he said (this happens often), so I asked him to repeat himself. As usual, he just replies with \"oh, nothing.\" I tried pushing for an answer, but he said, \"sunny day outside, isn't it?\" something he often says instead of repeating himself.\n\nI understand it must be exhausting for him to repeat himself multiple times a day, and I really do try to focus when he speaks. But with my hearing loss and online calls, sometimes I just don't catch it. Today, I got frustrated and muted myself. He asked why, and I said, \"Well, talking isn't worth it, right? Since I can't hear you anyway and you won't repeat yourself.\" He responded, \"Yup, talking ain't worth it then.\" Since then, we've basically been ignoring each other.\n\nI'm not great at verbally expressing my feelings, so I often write little stories to explain how I feel, I did that today and send it to him. He read it but didn't reply. He hasn't slept in over 24 hours, so I get that he's tired, but I can't help being scared that this is the beginning of the end of our relationship. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him.\n\nAnother ting: I'm not good with silence because my thoughts spiral, so sometimes I ask him to start a conversation or just talk to me. He always says, \"I'm not a yapper,\" which I understand, but it feels like he NEVER initiates conversations. Sometimes it just feels like he isn't willing to fight for me or try to make me stay.\n\nI know he just came out of a toxic relationship where he was constantly told he was wrong and blocked multiple times a day. And that really did a number on him. We promised never to block eachother, and we've kept that promise. But still... am I overthinking because of my mental health, or is this actually the start of the end?\n\nTL;DR: Dating my boyfriend for 3 months after reconnecting from years apart. We both struggle with mental health. Today, I got frustrated because he wouldn’t repeat himself on a call (I have hearing loss), and now we’re ignoring each other. He rarely starts conversations and I’m scared he’s not willing to fight for me.

I think its true, Im feeling resentful but i wouldn't feel like this as much if there was a bit more compromise or effort to at least understand where I'm coming from, not just say you understand and thats the end of the convo.

It was full of romance from start to finish. I have never felt so well taken care of, seen emotionally, satisfied physically & sexually, and just reassured in every aspect of my relationship before. Not only did he ask me to be his girlfriend, but he expressed that he loved me and that he was in love with me, and that he wants to build a future, is committed to me, and sees me as his future wife. I want all of these things with him, and I am committed to him as well.\n\nAlso, he’s not love bombing me. If he’s love bombing me then we’re love bombing each other. We’re both adults who have been through our fair-share of relationships, so please keep those comments to a minimum :). \n\nThat being said, we got into it on the last night we were together, twice, on 2 separate incidents. The first one, he got upset with me because i didn’t want what he offered, and for some reason, he took that personally. It was as simple as I was pouring myself some water from the limited fountain in the hotel lobby, and the water ran empty. I, was personally ok with my half-cup of water, however when i walked away, my partner motioned that i should come get some from his fountain and I mentioned that i was ok. He then mumbled under his breath that i was being ‘difficult’ and even went as far as to yell at me because i didn’t take what he was trying to give me. When we get on the elevator i angrily snapped at him and said why does me not wanting any more water effect you this much to where you’re calling me ungrateful and getting visibly angry. He was making it all about him. It was very odd. As we were getting off the elevator i decided to hang back , and i went back down to the 1st floor, he was upset with me for that. He called me , requesting i come back upstairs and that he was uncomfortable with me downstairs by myself and he was responsible for my safety. I found it endearing, also a little turned on, but didn’t want to return just yet. When i did end up returning, he was clearly still not ready to talk. He was angry! All because i didn’t want water. It took us 10 min of going back and forth for him to admit he was WRONG and he apologized and asked how could he fix it. It was a lot.\n\nThe 2nd incident we were sitting outside and i was very sleepy and just in a relaxed mood. I’m neurodivergent and sometimes things can get overstimulating for me. He decides to make stomp-clap sounds and just be a little louder than i anticipated and i motioned to him to stop and that im overstimulated. He took that VERY personally and said he felt like i had rejected him! It was nuts. He said that because i hadn’t said that since he’s known me that he was taken aback by me saying i was overstimulated and that he wasn’t sure how he’d respond to that if i said that to him. I told him you’re not going to make me feel bad for neurodivergent and or for feeling overstimulated. When i said that he shut down. Didn’t talk for 10 min. Just because i said that one behavior was overstimulating , does not mean that i find you as a whole overstimulating and that you should stop engaging. \n\nSince we started dating this is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, which means it’s a pattern to a bigger problem. Outside of this issue our relationship is great. I don’t need to create a pro’s/cons list because the pros are so long and I know this really my only con.

He doesn’t want to do it because he wants to figure out his purpose and trajectory before he makes any changes.\n\nI was already upset about him not getting the help he needs or moving on, but now he isn’t letting our relationship move forward either. After 8 years together, I had hoped we can start planning towards our future and hitting those milestones that are important to both of us, like moving in together and getting engaged.\n\nI feel like I’ve hit a wall. I turned to my therapist, close friends, and family about what to do in this situation. They all said I’m in an incredibly difficult position, and I need to think about my own boundaries and whether I can accept him the way he is now, if he never gets help. If I’m being honest, I’ve been unhappy for almost a year, and I’ve tried to communicate with him how his depression is impacting our relationship and hurting me. He says he knows all this and that this is his fault. I told him I need for us to come up with a plan to have a happy, healthy relationship again, and move on, but then he says he can’t do that without knowing his purpose.\n\nAt this point, I’m considering a pause in the relationship to give him the space to reconsider seeking help without feeling pressured and for me to protect my own well-being because I’m burning out fighting with him and waiting for him to make progress.\n\nReddit, do you think this is the next step to take at this point?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend refuses to seek treatment for his clinical depression, and it’s impacting our relationship and preventing us from moving forward.

He’s been supportive when I lost a close family member and to be honest he’s just been really supportive throughout the 9 months of which has been one of the most difficult years I’ve ever had. He never asks or expects anything in return, he’s just always there. We get on great, I always want to know about his life and find out more about him. \n\nWe call when we can.\n\nHe tells me I’m beautiful etc but then he always drops the ‘I want to stay single, I enjoy being single’ whenever we start getting really close. He’s always really busy working long hours (he often sends me photos of work or him at work) and I do genuinely believe there’s nothing sketchy going on. He moved house recently and I made a joke saying give me a tour when you’re moved in and he did - there’s no sign of any other female.\n\nHe’s been openly honest with me and told me he got divorced 2 years ago, he wasn’t happy and he left. He told me that he feels like another relationship would be a lot of pressure and that he is afraid of commitment (I’m disappointed at this point) then he said if he did want a relationship the only person he would want one with would be me… which I really don’t know how to feel about that.\n\nAnyway, he’s always been honest with me but I feel so attached to him despite never meeting him. I miss him sometimes when we don’t talk as much during the day if he’s super busy with work or I’m busy. \n\nSometimes he talks to me as if we are in a relationship and it gives me mixed signals and he’s agreed with me that he unintentionally does this and he doesn’t mean to. He claims he’s ’not romantic in the slightest’ but then he will do certain things that to me, show he actually does care for me on a deeper level but maybe I’m entirely deluded.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where we exchange nudes (my idea… he doesn’t force me to do anything) and we agreed that we won’t even touch ourselves unless the other knows about it or we will wait until a time where we are both free yet he says he doesn’t want commitment. He also told me he wouldn’t want to compete with any other guy if I was doing the same with someone else (there has been nobody since him and I started talking) \n\nHe’s always been upfront and told me if he met someone in his country, he would tell me if he went out on dates etc but he’s not looking for anyone right now and he is happy the way things are.\n\nTL:DR I guess my whole point I need advice on comes down to the question of - can you really just talk to someone platonically as a friend every single day for hours on end and not develop any feelings towards them. \n\nWould you spend hours talking to someone every single day for 9 months (even when you’re busy) just because you wanted the company (even though he has plenty friends) \n\nAm I completely overthinking this and getting attached to a stranger for nothing? I keep hoping one day things will change for us. The timing right now is not good for me - I’m in my final year of university and also working and one of my family members is poorly which is why I’m not pushing to meet up with him.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

When we first started dating, he said he wanted to work soon and was actively searching. Seven months later, nothing has changed. I’ve brought it up multiple times but there are never any updates.\n\nI’m getting more and more annoyed because I feel like we’re not on the same page, and it’s breaking my heart.

(4 months in)\n\nI’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend 19F and me 19M for 4 months now. We met in a game and things moved quickly. I really cared about her, but something recently happened that made me question everything.\n\n\nShe told me she used to play Rec Room, but that it had been a long time since she last touched it. I wanted to try the game myself, since it was something from her past and I was curious. While searching for her profile in Rec Room to add her, I saw some public gallery photos of her with another guy. In one of them, he was clinging to her. I didn’t recognize him, but I had heard a name mentioned before—Jay. I asked her if that was him, and she told me no, that it was someone else named Joel.\n\nStill, something felt off. So the next day, I searched her name again and found a public post made by Jay with a photo of them together. That photo was posted on February 14 of this year—Valentine’s Day. That’s when I realized she had lied. She wasn’t just on Rec Room recently, she was active on Valentine’s Day, and she was with her ex.\n\nI looked at his profile and saw even more photos of them together, including one where they were kissing in-game. That confirmed everything I was suspicious about. She had been in a relationship with him last year, and now I had proof. I confronted her with what I found, and she admitted they used to date. She said she broke up with him because he wasn’t taking her seriously. She also told me she stayed friends with him because she got close to his siblings, and that she was scared to tell me the truth because she thought I’d react badly. She said they barely talk anymore and tried to play it off like it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nWhat hit me wasn’t that she had an in-game relationship before me. It was that I gave her a chance to be honest, and she still lied. Twice. I had to go out of my way to search, check profiles, and piece together the truth on my own. And now when I express how it made me feel, she says things like “unfollowing him won’t fix anything” or “it’s too late to unfollow now.” That just makes me feel like my feelings don’t matter.\n\nI’m not trying to control her or tell her who she can and can’t talk to. But we’re only 4 months into the relationship, and I already feel like my trust was broken. I feel stupid for even having to investigate, but if I hadn’t, I never would’ve known the truth. I don’t know if I’m just being sensitive, or if this is a sign I shouldn’t ignore.

I last visited in the winter (March) and I'm trying to hit all the seasons to know a little bit what the climate is like before I move there. I asked for the time off and it was rejected today. So obviously I can't go visit him, and he won't come visit me. \n\nI told him my concerns that my inability to visit would push our timeline back and he doesn't seem to understand? He's of the opinion that only spending 4 weeks in person together should matter less than the two years we've been dating and the ten years we've been friends. And that the only thing stopping us right now is that I want to make sure I have a transferable job (because he only works part time and couldn't support us if I didn't find something fast) but I have other reservations I'm not sure how to articulate. I'm autistic with alexithymia and words aren't my strong suit. We've only spent 4 weeks in person together and even spending time together in person is totally different from living together. It feels like it would be a huge leap of faith to get married and close the gap. \n\nI asked him what he would want in place before closing the gap if our roles were reversed and he said a safety net, which he said I have - which consists of his friends and family, a way to support himself in case I died in an accident, which he says I also have because I'm the one with the career, and whether we align on intimacy. We don't know the last one, because the last time I visited he was too anxious for us to try anything. I agree with him that those are all important things, but I feel like there's more that needs to be put in place. I'm just unsure what it is.\n\nAm I looking at this all wrong? I'm a little upset that he doesn't seem to understand how risky this is because the \"safety net\" he insists I have is all *his* family and friends. Which doesn't feel like a real safety net. Not if we have a breakup or something.

She doesnt know how to live without just begging for things and using her mom’s credit card”( completely false, she and my mom are both business owners and she has met my mom several time so idk how she thinks that way of us, his mom is high high maintenance ) \n\nThen, five months after she blocked me, AN HOUR BEFORE WE WERE SET TO LEAVE his state ( I flew in so we could road trip in his car) , his mom unblocked me and sent a long, warm message apologizing for not replying sooner. \n\nShe said she needed time to find the right words, framed her silence as being out of love for her son, and wished us happiness. She also invited me to her house to give me a hug before we left.\n\nThe problem: she did NOT acknowledge blocking me, banning me from her house, speaking badly about me, ETC! Her “apology” blamed her silence on being emotional about her son leaving, not on her actions toward me. It felt manipulative, self-serving, and incomplete and it triggered massive anxiety. My stomach twisted, I cried, and my heart raced just reading it.\nI want to protect my boundaries and demand real accountability, not be manipulated into accepting a non-apology. She is literally like the queen bee of his household and everyone just deals with her BS. My bf even told one of his brother what she has done and the brother said “ That is sociopathic behavior. You should go.”\n\nMy bf’s mom isnt the only issue, he is too bc he is so close to her that he sometimes is wishy washy with being neutral with and being on her side vs giving me the space I need after I was completely abused and traumatized by her. So he sees her message as an olive branch and wants me to accept it; he even said that if nothing smoothes over, he’d rather I didn’t go home with him for his  birthday (October 13). My parents are split on advice: my mom says I should send a measured message asking if his mom is willing to talk, and my dad says to ignore her entirely and let him handle his mother himself.\nI don’t want to make the first move for either of them. This is about my feelings and seeking justice for myself. I’m not willing to back down or accept empty words, and I don’t trust his mom to be accountable ( or at all lol) . At the same time, I want to support my bf, show up for him and assert dominance in his life as we are in a serious relationship but I’m terrified of being manipulated or forced into being the “bigger person” in front of his family when that women hurt me BAD.\nMy questions:\n* idk if should go to his birthday whether or not things are resolved?\n* If I do go, how do I maintain boundaries and make it clear I will not accept a fake apology?\n* If I don’t go, how do I explain it to my bf in a way that protects my dignity and boundaries without making him feel punished?\n\nTDLR:\n\nBoyfriend emotionally cheated. His mom blocked me for 5 months, badmouthed me, and banned me from her house. She finally unblocked me right before we left his state and sent a vague “apology” that didn’t acknowledge her actions. I want accountability, not manipulation. His birthday is coming up, idk what my next step\nShould be?

However, recently, I have been feeling that he was not putting effort into having dates like we used to.\n\nHe's living in Finland and its been pretty sunny these days. I understand that they like to be out and enjoy sports under the sun. However, it's been really different these days. I have been waiting for him and communicated to him that we haven't had a good date recently because he's always out with friends, do sports, and even in their cabin. We call every day when he goes to work or when he goes home.

It's just that during the times when I felt so low and I needed my fiance, he was busy playing disc golf and that struck me lately. I felt really lonely in the relationship even especially that we are preparing to get married soon. For context, we are 6 hrs+ from his timezone, and I am working midshift so our time wouldn't be so conflicted.\n\nI have also communicated this to him, he even promised to spend more time with me, but he would just be good for one week then the next,  he's back to his old self already. I have not talked to him since last night because I am really just upset. I am giving myself a break and some space from the relationship but I am really on the verge of making it final and just break up with him.

It was an awful breakup where we'd unblock each other, edit previous text messages, look at each other's social medias.

YES A HUGE RED FLAG I KNOW. \n\nIt's been months being \"friends\" and we've been chatting less other than the usual catching up. We're both undergoing therapy and getting the help we need. I'm not saying we're perfect right now as there is still a bit of tension but we're still in contact. None of the petty posts or the editing of messages or deleting of messages.\n\nRight now I'm in a dilemma. Obviously I still love and care for this person. I have no intentions of being in another relationship because ive been focusing on myself and I'm still in love with them. We'd still call each other \"my love\" or send cute messages at times but not ALL the time. Maybe a few days of not talking. The last time we spoke they told me they had no intentions of getting back together with me and just wanted to remain friends. He also said he's not looking for a relationship at all.\n\nI'm fine with that.\n\nBut what's with the pet name calling, and other times we'd even broke to say I love you. I don't know it's night time right now and I'm overthinking things (might've had a bit to drink). He's had history of saying things he don't mean when feelings are overwhelming him which is one of the things he's focusing on bettering himself. \n\nHas any of you ever experienced being friends with an ex and end up dating again in the future when things turn up better? I would also like to ask for advice, maybe on how to continue on being more than \"friends\". Like should I continue inviting them to watch stuffs with me or play games with me. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do. I want to continue being sweet to them and prove that I am doing better. I was an avoidant type because of my trauma which did cause strain in the relationship and now I'm getting better from that but I'm scared I'll keep being sweet and it might turn them off.\n\nBefore you comment I should cut things off we've tried that and broke no contact in two months that's why we remained friends because we just can't be away from each other. It's toxic yes and we should grow seperately but I guess we just can't get away from each other. In a way we can't help caring and looking out for each other.\n\nFor context we're 22.\nWe were together for 8 months and broken up for 4 months.\nThe \"awful break up\" was blocking each other to focus on getting better but we keep editing our last messages sending little notes wondering how the other person is. Even went to the point I posted about being (still) in love and they thought I had a new partner and got upset but I explained it was for them. \n\nYes I know it's red flags everywhere but he's honestly been the best person for me and I'm very much in love with him despite us meeting young.\nI'm a bit of a hopeless romantic and I've been told I'm blinded by my love for them so please be gentle with your comments.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

My long distance girlfriend is going through the worst time of her life as she is grieving the loss of her father from a few weeks ago. I haven’t had the privilege to meet this man but I owe him everything for how he raised her to be such an amazing woman. I want to preface this that what she is going through is truly one of the worst things a person can go through especially since we are so young. I can see her shutting down and being emotionally drained and it breaks my heart. I want to be there for her and I also want to give her the space she needs to process. What I am going through is nothing in comparison to her grief, I know this, but I wanted to know how people can get through the silence and agony of not being able to physically be there for someone at a time like this. We both still love each other and she has her moments where she’ll be smiling and laughing but I know grief comes in waves. So this is followed by days of crying and sleeping. We went from checking in and calling and spending time together over the phone or discord to now I hear from her once in the day and then maybe some time at night when she’s awake. I really feel selfish even being sad about not seeing her, but I can’t reach out to anyone I know because they either dismiss how I’m feeling as being too emotional, or they outright doubt my relationship because it’s long distance.

I had let her know in advance that I’d be going to the college Thursday bar for the last time later that night, which she had said ok to.\n\nThe night comes and dinner gets delayed massively, by a couple hours, and she clearly doesn’t want me to go to the bar and instead get dinner, but it’s my last weekend as a student and I wanted to meet up with all my friends and acquaintances at the bar, so I went and have no regrets. \n\nI believe I’m completely in the right since it’s my last weekend in college and the last day to visit the main college bar (the bar is really a Tuesday/Thursday bar, otherwise it’s kinda empty).\n\nShe says she’s entitled to her feelings and that I was rude and hurt her. She also said that I’m walking over her and her family. I will say I attended her graduation and had dinner with her family the next day and I let her know in advance, plus I’ve met her family multiple times over the past few years.\n\nThis argument comes up once in a blue moon but gets heated and we just can’t seem to see the other’s side. Any advice for seeing the other’s side? Or moving on from issues where we just fundamentally disagree?\n\n\nTLDR: on grad weekend, I skipped a dinner with my gf’s parents to go to the campus bar with my friends for the last time. We still argue about it because it shows up in arguments about prioritizing each other and giving each other freedom.

She makes me feel like I’m part of her future, and I believe she truly loves me.\n\nBut here’s the problem:\n\nI get insecure so easily. If she doesn’t reply right away, my brain thinks she’s with someone else. I constantly check her location, her last seen on WhatsApp, and even overthink when she says she’s with family. Sometimes even one small word from her can ruin my whole day because I’m so sensitive. I even catch myself wanting to ask her friends ( she’s my first girlfriend and I’m her first boyfriend) if she’s had boyfriends before, or to confirm what she’s doing that’s how insecure I feel. I have her location where ever she go I check and think with who she is it’s a long distance relationship but the way.\n\nThe crazy part? Deep down, I know she’s loyal.

We met when out 5 months ago when I was visiting family in Italy. Im from US. I’ve seen him for a full week of each month so far, he’s in college and my family loves seeing me so it’s working out that I’m coming. He did visit me in July though. I know basic Italian but since being with him have learned more and the effort. He does not have poor english, it was always easy to talk back and forth. But now I’m questioning just how much the language barrier affects him I guess mentally? I just came back home, we went out on the weekend drinking with friends and he def drank too much. Slurring his words in both languages, switching between them.. By the time we were home I was like let’s go to sleep. I mentioned that I couldn’t understand him in an annoyed way. I don’t like to get super drunk so don’t like it in others lol. He then got annoyed saying he never asks me to talk slower because I never did cuz I don’t care and so because of that “a lot of the time” he doesn’t know what I’m saying. He’s very respectful and still was then but I knew it wasn’t true because we talk fine?? After we woke I told him I didn’t know that actually was a problem, and of course he confirmed that it wasn’t but was in the past. But it’s like he expects me to know way more Italian, he’s improved seemingly more than me because he already knew so much and just been perfecting it daily. And I’m also the one that pursued him in the way that he told me he figured I wouldn’t want a relationship like that (long distance) so he was just gonna let go of the thought of me that way even though he felt what I did. The same as in I’ve never met someone before that just made me so happy being around them like I did. And I would not want a long distance relationship, but he’s just special lol. I didn’t know his age when we met, I guess I assumed at least 21 because I wasn’t thinking about how 18 is the drinking age\n\nBut as of lately I’m just randomly paranoid that he will hook up with a girl because I know it sounds stupid, but because he is attractive and guess I’m making stereotypes because of his age, that younger guys just want that. He also said in the past that he can’t wait until I’m so fluent so we can do it in his language and it feel just as natural for me or whatever. So that also is feeding my paranoia because “why wouldn’t he want someone who speaks his native language”? I guess you would say I’m the dominant one, so it just seems pathetic for me to be like I think you’re doing something wrong even though there’s no reason. Especially when I have soo much that confirms the opposite. In the beginning of August when I was there he introduce me to a good friend that was traveling when we got together so I never met him and my bf kinda got embarrassed but in a cute way about  the dude saying that I’m all he talks about. \n\nHas anyone been in something similar??, I’ve been in 3 relationships, longest being 1 year.

Said I was the first guy to never be abusive or cheat on her. Said she loved all the trips and dates I planned out for us. Then proceed to say she didn’t deserve me and blocked me on everything. She had told me about a month into us talking that she had actually got out of a relationship like a week before we started talking, so I feel I was just used as a rebound. \n\nGirl 2: (19M 19 F  Talking Stage: 1.5 months) This one hurt the most because we got very close very quick. I did so much for this girl in a short span. Heres a few of many examples… She got stranded alone because her sister who she was with got arrested and her car got impounded, so I drove 5 hours at 4am to go get her (this was within the first 5 days we met.) I bought her tickets to her favorite soccer team because she had never been to a sporting event. She had 2 daughters and whenever I came over I loved the hell out of those kids (her daughter made me realize I might be a girl dad lol.) But one day she posts on IG and I see a mans hand on her in the photo. I reply “damn… really?” and she says “ 😂 if you cared so much you shoulda made me ur girlfriend” and blocks me. I was gonna ask her to be my girlfriend the next time I came over to see her 💀. \n\nGirl 3: (18M 20 F  Relationship: 3 months) I helped her get out of a very dark time in her life. She was doing a lot of pills and was generally not very happy with her life. I was always there for her, would stay on the phone with her every night, etc…  When she started getting better she slowly grew distant and would always have an excuse as to why I couldn’t come see her.\n\nGirl 4: (18M 18F  Relationship: 6 Months) She didn’t have much going for her. No car, no job, not much food at home. I would always give her rides, get her food whenever we hung out, took her many places she had never been or thought she would go. Eventually when she did get a job she pulled the same thing as Girl #1 saying she didn’t deserve me, except she didn’t block me just went ghost. \n\n\nEdit: I would like to include the fact that some of these girls did things for me too. Yes I probably did more In all of them and I see I need to slow down but heres a couple things they did. \n\nGirl 1: Would often buy me a drink from starbucks or dutch bros and bring me it on my lunch break at work. Bought me a nice manscaped kit. \n\nGirl 2: Gave me her old iphone 14 when mine got stolen at work. Also bought me a new pair of shoes for and i quote (fking her the best shes ever had) 😭\n\nGirl 3 and 4 were lost I will admit and I did most of the work.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

In the beginning she was pushing to be in a relationship with me, she said I love u first, said she was looking for a serious relationship and wanted to get married and have my kids. I know to most people that it’s a red flag for those kind of discussions while getting to know the person but i really liked this girl and i guess made myself comfortable with these types of conversations.\nAfter she went to college things were still going pretty well, i went up to visit her and had a good time but I felt that one of her friends (her roommate) was a bit wild and care free. \nAs time went on, me and my girlfriend started talking very less. I noticed and I pointed it out and she told me that she is doing midterms and   She would be busier and that school was her priority. She also claimed that i was too clingy. I was confused because I feel that more communication is important in long distance. I tried to be better and give her space but as time went on she began rushing a sorority and kept going out on weekends even though she was “too busy”. She is dealing with financial issues rn and she’s tryna join a sorority when the dues are 1000 a semester. I held my tongue. \nThe final straw was Saturday night when we were on the phone, she was talking about being a stripper for the money and i told her i didn’t want that for her, idk if she was joking or serious. Then we changed the topic. At the end of the call we said “i love you” and I said “i love u more” and she said “i think u do love me more” which really upset me.\nOn Sunday Morning I texted her goodmorning at 10am and she texted me back at 3pm, even though she’d been active all day. \nI sent her a long text about the problems we’ve been having about how we have a lack of communication and that i feel that she’s been disrespectful to me and she texted back another 2 hours later calling me out for love bombing her and being too clingy.

She and a friend of her went on a train trip trough europe (interrail) and she met a lot of people. \nAt this point i was in the military for 6 months so i already did not have a great time. \nWhen she and her friend were in Nice they met a guy and as he is britain but lives there he offered them to give them a tour through the city of Monaca.

And i said i dont have a problem with it as long as nothing happens.\nSo at the day they were in monaco i asked her to call me when she gets back to the hotel.\nShe didnt.\nI was really worried something mighr have happend.\nAnyways she told me she and her friend went to grab some drinks with this guy and ended up WITH him at their hotel at 5 in the morning. My gfs friend went then to bed and my gf and this guy stayed up till 8 and smoked cigarettes talking.\nShe fell asleep then as did he.\nI dont think they did anything sexual or so because her friend would have seen them.\nAnyways 2h later they realized he was still there and threw him out.\nMy gf called me told me everything and apologized.\n\nAfter a month of not to much contact she came home. (she always, till this day not any different, is often not texting me back when on vacation. She still is often on her phone but seems like she doesnt care about me or my messages. the same when i am on vacation. she doesnt ask me what is going on) \nThe first 4 days we didnt see each other because she said she needs a little bit of time for herself after travelling with her friend for so a long time.\nThen we met again on the weekend. And went to a ball. Everything seemed to be perfect. There was still love and everything i thought. Anyways 3 days later when i was back at military for a week she texted me she really needs a break with zero contact and she cant tell me what it is about. I was crazily confused. I tried to call her whats up and she just refused to pick up. So i tried to respect her decision. I texted her a week later that her not telling me whats up is eating me up from inside out. And that i would like to meet her and we dont have to talk about what wrong. And so we did. It was ok and everything but i was definitly not ok. A week later she told me she was snapping with this guy from south france for over a month and the both of them said they had feelings for each other. He even offered her to fly to her to meet her again. So she texted me rarely because she was texting somebody else. \nWhat really hurt was that she always told me she loves britain accent and people from france and the kind of music taste that apperently he had. And him living in the area of Nice and everything really made her romanticizing this situationship.\nI was in anexplainable grief. The worst part she said i must not tell anyone because she didnt want my friends and family to think something like that of her.\nSo i had to hide my grief. Which caused an 2 month depression. \nBut on the other hand i somehow was happy she came bakc to me( i think i was still just her safeoption).\nBut still everything got better till the point i realized she still had feelings for this guy SHE ONLY KNEW ONE DAY. \nSo i did probably the worst thing and stalked her phone. I told her and said i know she still thinks a lot about him. (Maybe i should add that she is a person who oftwn doesnt tell what is on her mind. And i asked her often if she still thinks about him and she said no.)\nShe totally freaked out. To the point she really was thinking about breaking up, because i look through her phone. Btw she still had his contact and followed him on instagram.\nThings got still a little bit better till tbe point she told me she doesnt have any feelings for me after we went on a week trip to istanbul and everything seemed as usual. \nAt this time i was studying very very hard to get into medical school.\nShe wasnt very supportive.\nShe then told me she will go on vaccation with another friend of her to nice where she met him.\nYou might be able to imagine how i felt.\nI couldnt really study for one and a half month.\nEven though nothing happend in nice and she didnt meet him(i dont wanna imagine what would have happend) i still was mentally paralyzed and couldnt do anything then stalking her insta counting her snapscore and worrying me brain out. \nAt the last day of her trip she suddenly deleted the last post of us she had on instagram. I confronted her and she was freaking out why i would care \"she never was a person whod like to share her love life online\" bullshit. We had a couple of photos online.\nAnyways i had the feeling i could not talk about it wirh her and went into therapy.\nI realized i had to talk to her and i told myself i would after my test for university.\nAfter my exam her feelings came back. It seemed like the ice of lacking love and attention from her was melting but deep down insinde of me are still very deep wounds i dont know how to get rid of as i think a lot of the topics to talk about, like her cheating and her hurting me, are very hard for me to adress.\nSo todays status is that i will be gone for a trip to australia for nearly 3 months and i am worried she might be hurting me again.\nAnd i know she would as soon as i am gone give me less and less attention and words of affection.\n\nBy this time of a lot of red flags from her side and me putting an unlimited amount of energy into this relationship and her just a very little bit all my friends say i should break up and that i am not in love anymore, they say it is not love it is emotionally being  dependent of her.\n(maybe as an additional information: our relationship dynamic has always been and still is, that i am giving a lot of attention and energy and her only a little, for example today i asked her if wanna do something and she just said it dependa what we would do. I list a lot of very cool things to do as a couple but she says she still has to clean her room and other stuff. So she will be laying in bed watching insta reels instead of doing something with me)\n\nI think every day about breaking up. But i really really love her. I truly do. And it scares me that i would probably be really hurt after the breakup for a long time.\n\nI know she is gonna hurt me again if i stay.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : My gf doesnt give me a lot of energy back. She completely broke my trust and i have deep wounds i cant really get rid of. It is hard to talk with her about things going a wrong way. She looses interest in me as soon as she or me is on vacation. I am going on a long vacation for 3 months and i am really thinking about breaking up or making a pause", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/Automatic-Region2517_234", "user": "u/Automatic-Region2517", "text": "Is it my fault or hers?\n\nI started talking to a girl two months ago through an online game. We quickly went from friends to something more—flirting, sexting, daily chats, good morning/good night texts, and even plans to meet in person.\n\nBut recently, she’s gone cold. She ghosted me for five days, gave vague excuses, breadcrumbed me with a half-hearted offer to hang out (which she didn’t follow through on), and then disappeared again. She says she’s overwhelmed—her visa expired, she’s traveling to my country to reset it, and she’s staying with a longtime online friend. I tried to be understanding, but her actions don’t match her words.\n\n\nMy gut says she’s found someone else, maybe someone new, since she didn’t speak highly of her ex. It feels like I’m being kept on ice as a backup plan, especially since she hasn’t blocked me and still has plans to meet up.\nI’ve reflected a lot and realized I never set clear expectations or boundaries. We acted like more than friends, but I never defined what we were. Maybe she was waiting for me to lead, and my lack of assertiveness turned her off. Still, if she had concerns, she could’ve voiced them instead of going silent.\n\nThis was my first romantic connection, so I made mistakes. I didn’t know how often people expect to talk, and I didn’t realize that even a short break in communication could cause anxiety. One night, I didn’t reply because I was tired, and she quadruple-texted me. I didn’t apologize because we weren’t officially anything, but maybe that shift in rhythm made her pull away.\n\nEven though I wasn’t perfect, I always tried—especially when she ghosted. A couple weekends ago, we had a short gaming session (unusual for us), and then she went silent again. 3 days go by and I technically double-texted for the first time, saying I was thinking about her and hoped her week was better. She replied two days later, saying she was busy prepping for her trip. I told her I understood but that the silence hurt. She apologized and said let’s do something what do I want to do. I suggested gaming and catching up, but she brushed it off with a vague excuse and said “another time.” That stung, especially after I just opened up as was vulnerable\n\n\nSince then, it’s been more silence—while she’s still active on Discord. It feels like she’s flaunting it, like she wants me to see she’s ignoring me. It’s hard not to take that personally. She has 2 discords one for PC and one for mobile and as I write this she is sat on a game whilst having discord open on her phone so she can text whoever it is she’s texting.\n\nMy plan now is to mirror her energy. If she comes back, I’ll have the boundaries and expectations conversation. If she’s vague or breadcrumbs again, I’ll ignore untill she says something meaningful, so I can have said conversation. Should I call her out for lying? Or Should I just set the expectations and boundaries? Or both? I fell hard for her, and part of me wants to hold on. But I also know I deserve better than being strung along. If she shows genuine interest and respects my boundaries, maybe we can rebuild. If not, I’ll move on.\nI’m unsure how to start that conversation if she reaches out. If she sends a dry “hey,” it feels weird to jump into something serious. Maybe I should match her tone until she shows real interest, then lay it all out.\n\nSorry for the long post—it’s messy, but I needed to get it out. I’d appreciate any thoughts on where I went wrong, whether I should give her another chance, or just let go.

{"id": "u/Different-Floor-6882_1637", "user": "u/Different-Floor-6882", "text": "Struggling with insecurity and trust. How can I move forward?\n\nHey everyone. This is my first time posting here and honestly the first time I’ve really opened up and asked for advice about something this personal, so I’d really appreciate any thoughts or feedback.\n\nI’m 19F and have been with my boyfriend 20M for about 3 years. Overall, he’s always been kind, respectful, and supportive. For the most part, I’ve felt secure in our relationship. But lately, my insecurities have been getting the best of me, and it’s caused a lot of issues, mostly with trust.\n\nA few months ago, I made the mistake of going through his phone. I know it was wrong, and I take full responsibility for that, but I had a gut feeling something was off. He wasn’t cheating, but I found that he had been messaging his friends’ girlfriends and deleting the messages. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal since they’re all part of a big friend group, but the fact that he was hiding it really bothered me.\n\nThat moment kind of broke my trust. I tried to move past it and give him the benefit of the doubt, but a couple months later, I looked again (I know, I know and I regret it), and I found he had been talking to another girl since the beginning of our relationship. It was a platonic friendship, but I had no idea she even existed. They texted often. sometimes daily and he confided in her about a lot of things, especially about our relationship and his feelings. Things he never shared with me.\n\nWhen I asked him about it, he told me he avoids telling me certain things because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He’s never once gotten angry with me, and in his eyes, he sees me as someone who can do no wrong. But I don’t want to be put on a pedestal.\nI want honest communication, even when it’s uncomfortable. Because hiding things to protect my feelings still ends up hurting me.\n\nTo his credit, he’s really been trying to prove he can do better since all of this happened. He’s been more present, more reassuring, and I can see the effort he’s making. But communication is still a struggle. I don’t want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells or be afraid to talk to me honestly. That’s not the kind of relationship I want.\n\nAt the same time, I’m trying to hold myself accountable too. I know this isn’t all on him but it’s not all on me either. I’ve struggled with insecurity for most of my life, and I think that’s made it harder for him to feel safe opening up. Sometimes I feel like I was the one who made him feel like he had to hide things, and that’s a really painful realization.\n\nOn top of that, I’ve also been feeling really conflicted because all of his friends and family seem to think I’ve been completely irrational. They’ve said it’s totally normal to have friends of the opposite sex, and that it’s actually weird not to. They’ve even told him he should break up with me, and that going through each other’s phones is toxic and unhealthy. And while I understand where they’re coming from, it’s made me second-guess everything, everyone of my boundaries.\n\nI’ve started to wonder if I really did go too far. I feel guilty, even though what he did felt like a big betrayal to me maybe it just hit a personal nerve because of how insecure I already was. It’s hard not to internalize all of it and feel like I’m the problem.\n\nWhat I want more than anything is to feel secure in myself. I want to stop feeling like I’m not “enough,” or that I’m ruining something good just because I’m afraid of getting hurt. I want to be able to trust him without overthinking everything, and I want to be someone he feels comfortable being real with.\n\nSo how do I start working on this? How do I rebuild my confidence and trust without ignoring the things that hurt me and without making him feel like he has to hold back? \n\nThanks in advance to anyone who read all this. I’m also totally open to giving more context or answering questions if anything is unclear or you want more details.\n\nTL;DR:\nI (19F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for 3 years. He’s kind and supportive, but my insecurities have caused trust issues especially after finding out he was hiding conversations with other girls, including one close friend he never told me about. He’s made a real effort to rebuild trust, but I still struggle with doubt and resentment. His friends and family think I’m being irrational and even told him to break up with me, which has made me feel worse. I just want to feel secure in myself, rebuild trust, and learn how to move forward in a healthy way for both of us.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "SOCIAL_MEDIA_SURVEILLANCE", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

After tough years and some personal mistakes on my part, we’ve talked, I’ve forgiven her, and we’re working on rebuilding trust and exploring a more open sexual lifestyle together.\n\n\nNew to Reddit and First-Time Posting (Apologies in Advance)\nI’ll start in the middle because that’s how my brain is working these days. Back in May, I found out that my wife had an affair with someone from her childhood. It all started when I went to pick her up after a night out with her friends. As usual, she had trouble controlling her alcohol consumption. I brought her home, helped her get into bed—the usual husband duties.\nOn the way to bed, she dropped her phone. When I picked it up, I saw some explicit messages. While she was very drunk, I looked through her phone and discovered that she had had an affair a few weeks earlier with a high school boyfriend. The ironic part is that I had organized the vacation and arranged her accommodation, supporting her to take a few days to unwind from the daily grind of work, kids, and life.\n\nI did feel a bit uneasy about her going away because I didn’t know him, but at the time, I trusted her.\nLooking back over the past ten years, life has been hard. Without support from our extended families, we’ve been raising three kids, some with health issues. This took a big toll on our friendship and mental health. While she managed most of the household responsibilities, I buried myself in work. Naturally, our relationship shifted from husband and wife to more like flatmates, focused on survival rather than connection.\nI have to acknowledge that I wasn’t the best partner over the last decade. I wasn’t always present emotionally, and I didn’t always handle things well. I can’t fully blame her for what led to the affair.\n\n\nAfter a very aggressive and violent night of yelling and shouting from both of us, she took the kids and went to her parents’ place for safety. While I was still in an emotional rollercoaster, I reached out to the wife of the affair partner and shared what I knew. This brought me some relief and clarity about the future. I regret any pain I caused her, but I couldn’t let it go.\n\nSince then, after long conversations with my wife, I’ve come to understand the kind of sexual and lifestyle exploration she craves. I realized that I am happy to share and experience this with her, as long as it’s open and without secrets.\n\nLong story short, I’ve forgiven my wife and understand what led her to have an affair. I’m taking life day by day, trying not to dwell on the loss of trust. I do believe we are good for each other, and if we keep communicating and working hard, we can have a great life ahead.\n\nIf anyone actually read this far, I really appreciate your time and patience. This is the first time I’ve put my thoughts and feelings into words.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

He’s a wonderful person, and I do love him, but our relationship has had its ups and downs. We’ve had a few serious arguments—mostly around intimacy. I’m more conservative while he’s more open, and at times I wasn’t sure if we’d make it through. It’s taken a lot of work to reach where we are now, and though we’ve made progress, there’s still room to grow.\n\nSometimes I feel comfortable being intimate, sometimes I don’t. He often expresses his need for intimacy, and while he never pressures or forces me, I can see it affects our relationship when I’m not in the same space. I’ve struggled with standing firm on my boundaries, and I’ve told him that I want to be seen as his girlfriend, as a woman he loves—not just as someone to be intimate with.\nAfter a recent argument, he reassured me that our relationship is still safe. And though I admit I was harsh when I told him it felt like he missed me mostly because he was horny, I know he loves me very much—it just so happens that he has a high libido. He’s also shown his love and commitment to me and my family in ways that have nothing to do with intimacy, which proves to me how genuine he is.\n\nDespite these challenges, we love each other deeply and share a vision for our future. Even though we’re long distance, that hope for what we’re building together has kept me motivated to work through our differences. I believe that if we can reach a stable foundation, we could be very happy together in the long run—it just requires some adjustments from both sides.\n\nI’ve read that the first year of a relationship is often the hardest. So I wanted to ask for advice for those who can relate. What helped you get there? What changed that strengthened your relationship?\n\nI don’t think either of us is toxic for the other. We just have differences that can be difficult to sort out. I believe in this relationship and we truly want it to work.\n\nTL;DR: My partner and I have had a rocky start, mainly around intimacy due to our differences.

He told me he doesn’t need me to contribute to rent because he prefers living alone. He set i can only allow to saty in his place three times per weel. Still, he expects his partner to have financial awareness, long-term planning, and consistency.\n\nHe said things like:\n\n* *“Saying things but not doing them just brings disappointment.”*\n* *“Dating is a test whether someone is consistent, honest, loyal.”*\n* *“If our plans and behaviors align, it works. If not, then we go separate ways.”*\n* *“Don’t skew this into control or toxic. I’ve already accepted that you may not want to walk the same road.”*\n\nFor him, love is demonstrated through actions, numbers, and future planning, not through words or emotional closeness. **He’s told me:** ***“I don’t need to remind you. I only focus on what I can control.”*** **and** ***“I want to see results, not just intentions.”***\n\nThe difficult part for me (anxious-leaning) is that when I try to share feelings or celebrate small wins (like a brand I love reaching out to me), he quickly switches into a pragmatic tone: \\*“\\****Can it turn into money? How can you collaborate?”*** When I feel hurt and ask for reassurance, he sees it as me rejecting his practical advice. He sometimes even says, *“You seem to always go against money. You need to think why.”*\n\nI know he isn’t trying to be cruel. He grew up in a family where his mom valued money and control, and he learned early to shut down emotions and be self-reliant. After his divorce (his ex-wife wanted more freedom and social life, while he didn’t like her going out late), he now takes the stance: ***“If it’s aligned, it will work out naturally. If not, we just walk different roads.”***\n\nBut for me, this dynamic is painful. It feels like love = performance, and I’m constantly being reviewed. I miss warmth and closeness, while he insists on self-protection and independence. He says he doesn’t want to be a “coach,” but his words often feel like an evaluation of whether I’m “good enough.”\n\n    **TL;DR;** : a 30F struggling how to take the balance in the relationship with a judging, analytical man", "disorder_norm": ["GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I used to be very jealous when we first got together for 2 reasons — 1, I was extremely insecure from an old relationship and prior weight gain, and 2, he had no filter because his last relationship the woman he was with didn’t ever get jealous.\n\nOne thing to note is I’m bi, I appreciate a good looking woman but I’m more attracted to men. That being said I don’t make a huge deal of every male celebrity I’m attracted to. My boyfriend was different and would speak explicitly about the women he liked, maybe because I’m bi he thought I’d like it? I don’t. For example, talking about a Marvel movie would lead to him talking about how sexy Scarlett Johansson is. Look, I get it, but I don’t need to know, if that makes sense.\n\nOnce when we were talking about the movie Knocked Up he said he just couldn’t get into it. Fair enough but I tried explaining how it’s an interesting look at relationship dynamics and he immediately launched into “I couldn’t get past how Seth Rogen was with Kathryn Heigl, who I always thought was sexy as fuck.” Dude. Not the point.\n\nIn the past I’d get in my feels about it but I’ve learned how to brush it off. Not that it doesn’t bother me, but I don’t make a deal out of it. It’s simple not worth my time.\n\nHowever, the other day we were discussing a character on a new show and how she’s obnoxious. I was in the process of putting away dishes and likened her to Sofia Vergara on Modern Family, but said I liked that character better. He said “Yeah, but even for her it’s like ‘You’re lucky you’re so hot!’”\n\nI didn’t respond and kept putting away dishes. My daughter said something to me and I said “Mommy is putting dishes away right now” and he said “And she’s gonna be mad at Daddy for the rest of the night.” I said “Nope, just putting away dishes” and we didn’t discuss it again.\n\nSo it’s like… he realizes it, but maybe after he said it? It’s still frustrating. I don’t tell him when I watch Dexter that I’d like to strap that guy down on a table or how Adam Driver would make my knees melt because that’s hurtful. We are obviously humans who find other people attractive, do I have to know who you find attractive and why?\n\nI’m just looking for ways to approach this subject days later since it’s still bothering me. I want to be proactive and not attack him but it’s hard when I just want to yell “HERE ARE ALL THE TALL MEN I WANT TO BONE” only to hurt his feelings.\n\nAny advice?\n\nTL;DR\nBoyfriend likes to share who he finds attractive even when I try to disengage and not cause a fight.

It was two weeks long and we quickly became friends. At the time he was in a relationship. \n\nA few months go by, we keep volunteering together (it’s a year long program), he and his gf break up and we get closer, occasionally talking on the phone for hours, liking each other’s stories etc. \n\nWe volunteer with kids and we worked together on two summer camps, during the first one I’ve realized that I have a crush on him, and it hasn’t gone away since. On September 1st we finished the program, and during the ending ceremony, he half jokingly said that he doesn’t know if we’ll keep in touch because we live far away, we’re from a small country, and we live two hours apart, he lives in the south and i’m at border between center and north. \n\nI was worried that i’ll be filled with regret if I won’t do anything about my crush, and bcs he said that he doesn’t know if we’ll stay friends I figured that I don’t have anything to lose and messaged him asking if he wants to go out sometime, he replied saying that it’s a good idea and if I was free the following week. We agreed to meet up in a central city that is the same distance from both of us. His replies sounded a bit friendly to me and I was worried that he doesn’t think it’s a date so I didn’t bring it up. \n\nWe met at a mall at 12:30 pm, and I helped him shop a bit, then we went to a thrift store, and then we went to eat. We said goodbye at 8:00 pm. We barely talked about the program and we had amazing conversations, talking the entire time. We touched each other a few times, but nothing that can’t be friendly. We sat down at a restaurant which used to be me and my ex’s spot, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it and mentioned it to him. We got to talking about past relationships, and he said that he doesn’t know if he’s over his ex (they broke up in October but were together for almost three years), and that he doesn’t know what he’s looking for right now. It was pretty obvious at the point that it’s not a date. \nI was pretty bummed, bcs he’s a total gentleman, he kept offering to hold my bag, he offered his seat to me on the subway, and complimented me when I tried on clothes. At the end we had a long hug that was definitely\n more intimate than our usual one. \n\nWe talked more since the meet up, but not on the phone, only messages and story replies. I added him to my private instagram as well. I do think we’re an excellent match, and so do our mutual friends. I don’t know if I should try to move on, or if he’s also flirting with me but confused, or if I should bring it up again. \n\nDo you think I should try again? Get over him?

So, over the past year I've become friends with Naomi (34F) and really value our relationship. A few months ago, she started hanging out with Irene (29F) and the two of them seemed to become close very quickly. I had met Irene in group settings before, but a month ago we hung out one on one for the first time. Irene and I spent a whole day together and I enjoyed spending time with her. After I posted some pictures on social media, Naomi messaged me with a warning to be careful around Irene. I don't know all the details, but apparently Naomi told Irene some personal things about herself and Irene broke Naomi's trust by revealing what Naomi told her to another friend of hers. Irene apologized, but Naomi doesn't want anything to do with her anymore.\n\n  \nThe thing is, I trust Naomi's telling the truth and I value my relationship with her more than I value my relationship with Irene. I've never had a bad experience with Irene, but I know people have different sides to them. I've also been victim to having someone treat me poorly, but our mutual friends didn't believe me because the person harming me was supposedly too nice to do such a thing. So, I wouldn't want to dismiss Naomi just because I've only ever seen Irene be nice around me.\n\n  \nBut I feel like I'm in a difficult spot now. I don't even think Irene knows I'm aware of the situation with Naomi and if I mention it to her then that'll reveal Naomi's been talking to me about it. And I wouldn't want to make things harder for Naomi by doing that of course. So Irene's just messaging me like everything's normal. I could act cool around Irene, let the relationship fade and try to make it seem natural. I know two of my friends don't necessarily have to be friends with each other, but I'd still feel wrong and like I'm not doing right by Naomi if I just act like Irene didn't do anything to hurt her.\n\n\n\nThe main difficulty for me is that I'm even closer with Irene's other friends, none of whom I think are aware of the situation. So if there are group events I'm likely to see Irene again and I don't feel like I can talk to our mutual friends about the situation if they pick up that I'm acting cool around Irene. And I suppose it would be really awkward if Irene picks up how I'm acting around her. Has anyone experienced anything like this? How would you suggest I manage my friendships with everyone when I know something bad about Irene that they don't? And that Irene doesn't know I know about her either?\n\n\n\nTL; DR My friend Irene hurt my friend Naomi and now Naomi doesn't want anything to do with her. I believe Naomi, but I don't know how to manage my relationship with Irene and our mutual friends. None of them even know that I'm aware Irene hurt Naomi, and if I talk about it with them that could hurt Naomi even further. How do I manage my relationships with our mutual friends while holding this secret?

She lives in Belarus and I live in Belgium. The war with Ukraine-Russia had just started a few months ago, also I had left my job during this time, so financially I wasn't good. All these reasons in combination with the distance made it very hard for me to meet her, she couldn't visit me neither, because she needed a visa to be able to leave her country, she didn't have it. So I decided to treat her more like a very close friend.\n\nDuring our first year, I didn't tell her that I loved her, because I believed in real love, so I wanted to use it just once for the special woman and I could say it only after meeting her physically just once I thought, because I wanted to be sure that we loved each other physically the same as much as we did mentally.\n\nDuring this period, I would often tell her that I like her, that I miss her and that I want to visit her and I told her the reasons why I couldn't visit her. We were waiting for the war to stop, which never happened.\n\nAfter a year and a few months later, one day (on october 2023) she suddenly told me that she met a colleague at work and that she likes him very much. She left me to be with him.\n\nI became extremely depressed. I would often message her through instagram/whatsapp and tell her why I couldn't visit her.\n\nFast forward in April 2024, so after about 6 months she messaged back after I wrote her that she has a vacation soon and that we could meet and it would be the start of our relationship or the end.\n\nI became very happy. She told me that the colleague that she left me for, left her too. He stopped messaging her  and later he found another girl and left his job in the meantime. She told me that they didn't have sex, they just dated and she wanted to be with him but he didn't. We met on 9 may 2024, only for 3 days. Because she had a small vacation. But we had an amazing time together. We spend a lot of time together. We where walking togerher, hugging, kissing and much more more. We were very happy together. When we said goodbye to each other at the airport, we hugged and kissed each other so much\n\nWhen we returned home, we would tell how much we miss each other, how much we love each other and such. I've written her many beautiful and romantic messages about how much I love her. She told mr that I was her happiness, that I was her miracle, that her heart beats only for me, that she couldn't live without me. I felt the same.\n\nFast forward to 5 months and half later, on 1 november 2024, she suddenly told me that she's very depressed and that she needs time alone. I talked to her once and I asked why she felt that way, she told me because she's tired of everything... and that she's suffering very much.\n\nShe told me later that she wanted to freeze our happiness and continue our relationship when she would move to Europe (she wanted to focus on her job to move to Poland), so that we would be not separated (with the distance/war). She later replied that she misses me very much too and she's trying to come to Europe to be with me.\n\nI often would write her messages on instagram and she sometimes replied with \"I miss you too, very much\" with a heart emoji.\n\nOn june 2025, after 8 months since our breakup, she wrote me that she appreciates me a lot and that she loves me as a friend or brother.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I was in shock.\n\nI thought she was working hard to come to Poland and continue our relationship. I didn't expect this.\n\nShe also wrote later that I need to live without her.\n\nIt's been a month and I still feel devastated. I try to forget her everyday, I don't write to her anymore. I just still can't believe this. 3 years of very close friendship and real love relationship is gone just like that. We were soulmates. We have the same personality, same hobbies, same thoughts and we have a lot in common.\n\nI'm just sure that it all happened because first of all due the distance and because of that, she met a new man. She probably met him recently and she's thinking that she found the right person, so she doesn't think care about me anymore...\n\nI just would like to hear especially the thoughts of women about our situation from their perspective, what do women think that happened to her feelings and how could she stop loving me after all that?\n\nThank you all for reading.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

During one of our arguments I expressed that due to our lack of quality time, I was afraid our relationship wouldn’t be able to grow/change as we do as individuals to which he responded with “well I don’t plan on changing anytime soon”.\n\nAll these things combined make me worry that he thinks since we moved in together he doesn’t need to put any more effort into the relationship, despite me expressing my dissatisfaction with the effort he puts into our relationship.\n\nBasically in the forefront of my mind, I want to breakup with him because I am truly not happy in this relationship and I’ve stopped seeing a future with him.

Even if I know that what they’re thinking isn’t true, it kinda offended me because how are they so quick to judge? Plus I feel a bit bothered because obviously it’s not a good thing when your possible future MIL thinks that way about you. My bf knows I don’t even like his country (no offense but the US definitely isn’t my first choice if I were to move to another country lol) and that I’m just moving there because we both figured we’d have a better life if we live there instead of settling down in my country. And to be fair, he kept assuring me that it’s gonna be fine, that they’ll get over it they just need time to process things, and that they’re gonna like me. Hard to believe though lol. I asked him what if his parents are not saying/doing anything for now but after Japan they ask him to break up with me? This was his response:\n\n“That's not gonna happen also even if it did im 31 what are they gonna do”\n\nHow do I even handle the situation? I feel sad thinking about it because I’ve dealt with ex’s parents before who disliked me for unknown reasons and that made me miserable. I don’t wanna be in the same situation again but at the same time, I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to give up on him just because of that. It’s just that I’m scared this is gonna be a bigger problem in the future and I don’t wanna mess up his relationship with his family. I just can’t stop thinking, what if get married one day? Last thing I want to happen is to have in-laws who’s always gonna get in the way and make my life miserable.

I respect any thoughts and advice.\n\nHe told me he actually loves me, that he can do better, that he will fight for us, that he will do all the efforts. That if there is love, we can do everything!\n\n\n to sum it up it’s over 2years already, last year he suggested the plan for me to invite me to Italy but then he suddenly goes unreachable and inconsisten so I can’t communicate with him well, then until I get frustrated and mad at him about that because it feels like I don’t know where he’s leading me so I communicated to him about that, I expressed my frustrations. And ended it up, I told him one last chance, if nothing is going well then it’s done, I decided out of frustration, anger and and pain with my emotions, plus my uncle died way back home so I can’t fully grieve about what’s going on inside me and my surroundings. It was a bit easier for mo to move past on those months after may, till October. Full of his silence. He told me he can do I better.. but then he didn’t do anything on those  months, so I thought we’re done truly. I cried and prayed every night but I still feel unsettled with it, October came and then he reach out h\nWith a hey how are you, then later called me and saying I’m sorry can you forgive me.. I thought about it for few days and then he reach out again and then allowed him back again with saying promised me you won’t disappear this time and don’t do like you did, and show up, I needed your presence, actions not just words and he agreed, , he told me he arranged his travel to meet me last March 2025 but few days before March ends he called and I asked him why aren’t you coming as you said  and he told me, that’s what I want to tell you that I cannot come because I went with my family trip, so I get frustrated with that and he promised me to move that plan to October. On the May 2025;  I suddenly felt something weird and tried to reach him out, we had a good shot of communication last April then May felt something weird on my, I saw a post of him on Instagram with his Thailand trip, I felt hurt because he was able to travel to Thailand but not in Hongkong as I am here, I felt jealous because I saw a back of a girl, a hand of a girl on some of his photos and told me it’s two different girls a, one is a friend and one is his tour guide, but dinning in a Michelin restaurant with a friend or tour guide? That’s make s me feels wired and hurt, after that I asked him about him. He tried to explain his part and tried to make me regulate. But later when I tried to comment on the photo with emoji 🤨 removed me as his instagram follower so then I can’t see his post, I asked him he said, because we fought about the girl photos and that I’m getting obsessed with the girl even if he explain already. And that this is for my peace he doesn’t want me to keep thinking about it. I thought about it, I said maybe he\nIs intentions was true and reasons was genuine. We made up. \n\n\nEnd of July we talked and told me he was not able to come up with the plan on October to meet as he change it agin du\nNeto reason he can’t because this time his dad is going to finally have the knee surgery, and he need to come with him and he will accompany his dad, I felt frustrated again because as you know he can’t come up with the plan and promise that he said, but again he promised me he will come by March 2026, and he assured me he will come even if I will say I won’t wait. He asks me to wait for him and he will do it. I told him his not reliable  he always puts me to end it nothing, I’m hurt, I cried because all this long he makes me feel like I’m not a priority even if he said I’m his priority.

So I brought it up again a few days ago and we had a mini fight, he kept saying they’re friends, he doesn’t want to loose this friendship with her, he’s known her longer than he’s known me and that they slept together way before he met me.

Advice?\n\nI’ve been seeing this girl I met in 2024, and at first, it seemed like we clicked. She seemed interested in me because of how I dress, but the more I got to know her, the more I started getting a gut feeling that something wasn’t right. Now, I’m wondering if I’m just being used as an option and don’t know how to let go.\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s been going on:\n\nHer situation: She works a minimum-wage retail job, and her parents are paying for her university. She’s even told me that she doesn’t want to study anymore, which is fine, but it’s the way she talks about it that’s making me uncomfortable.\n\nHer lifestyle talk: She’ll sometimes send me messages about girls with older, rich guys who pay for everything. It feels like she’s low-key pushing the idea that she’s after that kind of life, even though she doesn’t directly say it. I was shocked seeing reels that even encourage this sort of lifestyle. \n\nMy situation: I’m doing my MBA while working a side gig to pay for my expenses. I’m aiming for a corporate job and to move up in my career to live a comfortable life. I don’t mind being single long-term if it means I can focus on my future.\n\n\n\nBut here’s where things get weird:\n\nInconsistent behavior: She’ll reply to my messages after like 5-6 days, and we’ve tried making plans to meet up multiple times, but it’s never followed through. We did meet in real life at an event, it's just that we were planning to meet outside that event we both go to.\n\nReels and mixed signals: She sends me reels about how “nobody cares about your character, just your money,” and about how important money is to others. She doesn’t say it directly, but it feels like she’s sending me these to let me know she’s not looking for anything serious unless it comes with a lot of cash.\n\nThe feeling of being an option: There have been times when I’ve just stopped replying to her, and she’ll reach out again, either calling or texting. It honestly feels like I’m being kept as a backup plan, and it’s frustrating. I even created a GPT session where I gave it rules to write replies to her messages, as I felt I don't want that stress.\n\nFrom the beginning this girl said she doesn't want to marry or date but she would say and do things that stated otherwise which kept my hopes up. But I still find myself conflicted about whether I should just cut ties completely or keep things casual as “friends” with no hard feelings. Honestly, I think I’m over it, but I don’t want to cause drama or feel guilty afterward.\n\nI’ve been single for a while and I’ve started to accept that maybe I’ll just be the “cool uncle” type, work on my career, earn a decent income, and live comfortably without anyone else. I’m starting to think all this stress over her isn’t worth it, but I’m struggling with how to let go without any unnecessary drama or guilt.\n\nHow do I move on from this situation without feeling like I’ve wasted my time or burned a bridge? How do I cut things off in a way that doesn’t make things awkward? Would any girl accept me as I am in life, like a guy in a mid-level role? Or do they expect me to earn more and more like some kind of shareholder? Are all girls like this?

What should I do?\n\nHello so, I (M25)  have been dating this guy (M25) for over a year. We are a gay couple. We had never had an argument before, and everything seemed perfect. We had a strong emotional connection and it truly felt I had met my soulmate.\nThere is one issue though. I have a medical condition that requires me to have a surgery to be sexually active (a circumcision). At the beginning, we had discussed this and he told me he would be ok waiting for me to have the surgery. I hesitated because he had expressed how he felt sex was an intimacy was an important aspect in a relationship, but he would be willing to wait given how well we connected.\nTwo months after starting dating officially, I got the surgery. Unfortunately, after recovery I learned that I would need a revision (second surgery). At the time, my boyfriend was very supportive and still said he would wait. \nNonetheless, around that time I got a new job and started grad school at the same time, which kinda delayed the entire surgery process. My boyfriend was supportive of the new job and me going to grad school.\nAt month 6, so like six months ago, we had our last conversation about the surgery, in which he expressed it was taking a toll on him. The reality was that although our relationship was perfect otherwise, we were never sexually intimate in any way at that point. I said I understood how he was feeling and that I would prioritize the surgery once I got on my new insurance from my new job. Life happened and between work and study, I couldn't prioritize the surgery. I never brought up that topic again, and he never did either. And as I said, everything else in the relationship was going well.\nSo fast forward to two weeks after our one year anniversary, he confessed he had a one night stand with a random guy. It was shocking for me to learn that. I was upset, angry, sad and disappointed at the same time. He never talked to me in the last 6 months about his frustration. I had the power to fix the problem. He could have told me and I would have gotten the surgery. \nHe did seem remorseful and showed me he would start going to therapy right away, but I feel conflicted. I know he loves me, and I love him too, but I don't know if I can ever trust him again, even if he confessed and can see that he deeply regrets his actions. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend confessed he cheated after us dating for one year due to us not having sex, which was not possible because I needed a surgery.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

{"id": "u/AmgelicTeabag_135", "user": "u/AmgelicTeabag", "text": "Is it normal to not feel sexual attraction during your first meeting?\n\nWe (20F & 24M) have been dating for 10 months and i’m 99.99% sure he is the one. He’s everything I could’ve wished for in a partner and more. To say we are in love is an understatement, we are obsessed with each other, we get butterflies just at the very thought of each other, we understand each other as if we were long lost twins that finally got reunited after so long… and the sexual attraction we share is immense. We sext each other almost every day, I masturbate multiple times a day just because even the most innocent thoughts of him make me so incredibly horny… Most of my sexual fantasies are all about him and only him (though I myself am rarely, if ever, in them)… This is the man I ~want~ **Need** to marry and to have my babies, and he feels just as strongly. I never felt this much attraction and “oneness” to another person in my life.\n\nWe both thought that based on this, that our sexual attraction would be this unstoppable otherworldly force when we would meet for the first time, especially considering we were both virgins. It felt almost impossible for this not to be the case. After 8 months of yearning and never ending sexual tension, I was finally able to fly from the US to his country (France) to stay with him for two weeks in a nice quiet Airbnb apartment. We agreed to abstain from masturbation for a week before visiting in order to heighten our senses to the maximum (he failed at first, but was able to make it 5 days, and the first three days felt like literal torture to me). I spent a lot of money on sexy outfits/self care, wanting to make sure every little detail was perfect… We did have the smallest of doubts/anxiousness try to climb up within this week before meeting, but we didn’t think anything of it.\n\nWhen we finally met we were both very shy/anxious and a little awkward/uncomfortable around each other, as expected as we both have very bad social anxiety and are extremely introverted…\n We had spent a good amount of time prior discussing our expectations and boundaries of how our first meeting may go (we discuss absolutely everything together, there is nothing we don’t share). \n\nHe had reassured me numerous times (over a period of months, as I would keep checking in just in case he changed his mind) that he wanted me to show my full feelings for him and to “not hold back” even if he looked shy… So with this in mind, I tried my best to be as assertive about my love for him as is possible for my shy self. I immediately held his hand, kissed his cheek on the train, and started being “touchy” with him (nothing too inappropriate, mostly in a lovey/romantic way), but he seemed a bit uncomfortable with this despite his previous assurances. I asked him if he was okay, and he just said that he was anxious with being so openly romantic in public. \n\nAfter arriving at our AirBnB, we agreed that we would follow through our prior “plan” which was that we would take our showers then “spend time in bed” with only our underwear… Before his shower, I surprised him by placing his hands on my chest through my tank, which he got hard and started breathing a little heavily and looked completely amazed/astonished for about a minute before leaving to take his shower… I didn’t really feel anything from this, but I didn’t think much of it as my breasts aren’t the most sensitive. \n\nWe were both really shy/anxious when we got in bed for the first time, I think we touched each other through our underwear a little, and possibly even tried having sex? (it’s all really fuzzy to me so I forget), but we ended up just cuddling in the end instead as we couldn’t really make it work… “No problem”, I thought. It’s only our first day and we’re still getting used to each other. \n\n….Well the other days didn’t go much better. We would try a lot of things (mostly handjobs/blowjobs/him eating me out, playing with/sucking my chest, etc.) but nothing really felt good and he had a little trouble cumming/staying hard, and would only be able to finish from his own hand. This had really deteriorated my confidence as he would always say before meeting that he “would always be hard around me and wouldn’t be able to last more than two seconds”. He assured me that this was only because of his anxiety and that he still thought I was “the most attractive woman he’s ever seen” and that I was just as attractive (if not more) as I was in my pictures. We both voiced our shared disappointment in things not going the way we had wanted, but we agreed that we still were getting used to each other IRL and that it would get better with time. I was finally able to start consistently being able to make him cum without his help a week in after getting better with practice, which boosted my confidence a bit. But  throughout my whole trip he wasn’t able to make me cum even once (despite him putting so, so, so much incredibly selfless effort in trying his very best), which had made me a bit sexually frustrated at times (not at him, but more so on myself). \n\nWhenever we had sex, it felt more mechanical than anything. I was very excited about having it, as I always dreamed of doing so, but it felt like a battle to get my mind in the right place to feel any pleasure… For whatever reason, I felt almost numb and was mostly focused on his pleasure more than my own. He expressed that his anxiety had caused similar numbing effects (though less so than mine). Even kissing didn’t really feel like much…. though I still liked doing it just because I love him so much, and it’s not every day you get to kiss your partner. The only times I was able to feel any real pleasure/sexual attraction to him was when I was drunk (I apparently get super horny when drunk, so I began to see it as an “key” to unlocking this attraction) and maybe one or two very rare brief times during the whole trip sober. When I was drunk I couldn’t keep my hands off him, it felt like I was free to act without inhibition, and with this freedom came my desire. Kissing him felt actually *good*, like tingly good for the first time… and sex felt really good at some parts too (though still not anywhere as good as I imagined), I even felt like I could almost cum at one point… The only problem is that we could only drink in the evening, and that is when he gets tired, especially with alcohol involved, so a lot of the time I would be drunk and horny but he wouldn’t give it to me even if I would be practically begging…. There also was the problem that he just so happens to be most horny in the morning, but that is when I am most tired, so when he wanted to do it in the morning, I denied him to only a blowjob (not because he forced me, but because I still genuinely wanted to get him off as I will happily jump at any opportunity to do so for this man…). There were also times when we were getting really hot and heavy in which got ruined by little accidents like him knocking over a wine glass or by me throwing up on his manhood…. I also would be a little dry sometimes as we rushed things, and he would have trouble staying hard because apparently I was “too tight” that it hurt him?????? He also would understandably sometimes get a little upset as I would (to my guilt and regret) get a bit “pushy” about asking to have sex… I would ask for sex almost every day as I was in a lack mindset, thinking only about how we need to make the most use of this short time we have together or we’ll regret not having done more… During the last two days, we bought a toothbrush so I could masturbate (I can’t feel good with my fingers), and even though I was able to cum (in a separate room, I was too shy to have him watch), it still felt pretty numb…\n\nAfter our trip, we both discussed our feelings fully. He had said that he felt like we had moved too fast before we got fully comfortable with each other, and he regrets not taking things more slowly (like cuddling more, spending more quality time together rather than rushing to reach every milestone as soon as possible) and I agreed. I brought up my worry feeling like he wasn’t attracted to me (which in turn, hinders my ability to be attracted to him, as my attraction to men stems from our bond/connection rather than physical looks alone. I literally can’t look at a guy and be turned on, even if he is stereotypically “hot”), and he said that he was very sexually attracted to me but his anxiousness made it hard for him to display it. Even after confessing my lack of physical attraction to him during this trip (it almost immediately came back after), we concluded that we just needed more time to be comfortable with each other in person and that our attraction will follow. \n\nI want to believe that this theory will be true… I literally can’t imagine my life without him in it… and a good part of me does believe it, but another part is a bit worried as I always hear about how attraction is “instant”, or if it isn’t, it’s just because people haven’t developed enough of an emotional connection yet (which we already have in enough abundance to solve world hunger)… So my question is…  Is this normal? Do people usually have to get used to each other in person before developing sexual enjoyment/attraction to the other physically? Are we just very inexperienced? Could it be anxiety that is responsible? Will it get better with time?\n\nTLDR: I’m incredibly sexually attracted to my boyfriend… when we’re apart. During my two week trip together, I could only feel sexual attraction/enjoyment to him when drunk.", "disorder_norm": ["GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "REUNION"}

We’re both flying there to spend some time together and finally have the much-needed big talk. Really hope things go well and don’t turn nasty.\n\nI’m a 31-year-old Indian woman. From 2016 to 2024, I was in a long-distance relationship with a British-American man (now 35M). We met when I traveled onsite for work and connected instantly. Despite the distance, we stayed together for 8 years and seriously planned a future.\n\nLast year, I heard from mutual friends that he might have cheated. There wasn’t solid proof — just that he stayed in touch with his ex, which broke my trust. I’m quite sensitive about loyalty, so I ended the relationship.\n\nIt’s been a year now. I still think about him, and recently he reached out saying he wants to meet during my upcoming work trip. He told me directly that he still loves me and wants to marry me.\n\nPart of me still loves him. He has always been supportive, never disrespectful, and played a big role in my career growth (even tutoring me when I struggled). But I’m also scared of repeating old mistakes, and I can’t tell if staying in touch with his ex was a real betrayal or just bad boundaries.\n\nI usually see myself as rational and independent, but when it comes to him, my logic goes out the window.\nOur backgrounds are also very different (Indian vs. British-American), which sometimes worries me.\n\nMy specific questions:\n\nShould I meet him and see if there’s anything left to rebuild?\n\nAm I being naive to consider marriage after this?\n\nHas anyone been in a similar intercultural, long-distance situation?\n\n\nTL;DR:\n31F Indian woman dated a 35M British-American man for 8 years long distance. Broke up last year after hearing he might have cheated (no solid proof, just contact with ex). Now he wants to marry me and meet soon. I still have feelings, but I’m scared.

I promised commitment, but I'm unsure if I’m ready.\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm 25, and I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 8 months. At the start, everything was easygoing and fun. We connected well, and I thought we had something good. I had some doubts early on but decided to give it a chance because I really liked her.\n\nNow, I'm struggling. Lately, I don’t enjoy spending time with her as much as I used to. I’d rather do almost anything else than talk with her. She’s constantly asking if something is wrong because she can tell I’m distant, but I just push those feelings down because I don’t want to upset her.\n\nWhen she asks me to open up about what’s bothering me, I just feel exhausted by the idea of talking about my emotions. I’m not good at expressing myself, and when I do, it just feels like a lot of pressure.\n\nI’ve also noticed a shift in how I feel physically. I don’t enjoy intimacy anymore—I’m just going through the motions for her sake. It’s almost like I’m just doing it because I feel like I have to, not because I want to. And that bothers me, because she’s a great person, and I don’t want to hurt her.\n\nWe’ve talked about the future—meeting each other’s families, etc. I promised I’d do that, but right now, I’m not interested in moving forward with that. It just doesn’t feel like the right time. I’m also not sure if I’m emotionally or financially ready to commit, and I’m wondering if I should just focus on myself for a while. I thought I would be okay with long-term commitment when I started dating, but now I’m not so sure.\n\nI don’t have a fear of commitment; I just feel like it’s not the right time in my life, and maybe not with her, even though I care about her. I think I want to be more stable in my career and emotionally before I make those big decisions.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for advice. I don’t want to stay in a relationship that isn’t fulfilling for either of us, but I also don’t want to hurt her or make a rash decision.

We’ve been together almost a year and I moved away last month. \n\nWe have a 5 hour time difference, and so I try and keep in touch as much as possible. We call when she’s free and we message when she is free too! She became friends with someone I know before I left, and i’m cool with the guy and I trust my girlfriend completely. I don’t believe she would cheat as she has been cheated on before, and I know he dispises cheating too. \n\nThe last 2 weeks, she’s been spending a lot of time with him. To give examples, they watch films and go on drives, sometimes lasting 2/3 hours and at most, she’s been with him for 9.

I know they’re only watching films and speaking about things, but i’m scared they’re getting very close very quickly, whilst i’m just sat here giving up doing things just to be ready for when she is free to call/talk. I want to call to her anytime I can, and i thought she’d be the same.

It feels like I’m giving up my experience to keep in contact and she isn’t willing to do the same, except watching films and talking can happen at any time. \n\nI don’t want this to create a barrier between us, and i don’t want to let my jealousy over the time she spends with her friend to affect the times we actually talk/call, but I’ve mentioned it to her and she says she can’t just spend her time working around me, so i feel like i need to. I just don’t know what to do and it’s affecting my mental health heavily. I miss her so much, and I know she misses me to. Im just struggling with less contact with her, and i can’t seem to understand why she wouldn’t leave her friend an hour before to ring me for an extra hour. I just don’t know how to go about my emotions. \n\nCan anyone help?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD"], "triggers_norm": ["JEALOUSY_INSECURITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

We met in person while he was in my city visiting family and after we exchanged contacts, we instantly clicked. He lives in a different state, and being broke and busy uni students we only have the chance to see each other in person during semester breaks. \n\nHere's the thing. I really, really like him. I think he's an amazing, unique person who happens to insanely click with me on our interests and core values (for the most part). This was to the point where I thought it genuinely was fate that I met someone like him, that he was my soulmate. Pretty naive, I know, but keep in mind being the shy, passive person I am, I've never been in a serious romantic relationship before. In the first month or so of knowing each other, we talked non-stop. I was reserved at the beginning and conscious of moving too fast, but he dove straight in, showering me with compliments and promises and what have you. Naturally, this died down after a month or so, and I appreciated that he would apologise for and be communicative about it. I didn't hold that against him, we were both getting insanely busy. \n\nHe'd told me he was coming up to my city again this month, so we made plans for a proper date early on. He said he would plan the whole thing and keep it a surprise, and the way he went on about it made it seem like it would be this grand gesture. Of course, with all of the fuss he made, I got pretty excited for it. The day came and I got dressed up, I made him a gift and I waited for him. The date itself was nice, and I was so happy to see him that I didn't mind how plain it was. Even then, though, it was underwhelming. He'd gotten too busy to actually do most of the things he'd been planning and it just wasn't all that. It kind of felt like heading out with a friend, almost, with hardly any romance. I'm not a picky person, and I hate to be shallow. I don't ask for expensive flowers or pricey restaurents. It's just the way that the date made me feel like I didn't matter as much to him anymore. I spent hours cooking for him and dolling myself up only to receive none of that same energy back. As shallow as it sounds, I wanted him to compliment me and call me pretty, but I got one 'You look nice too', only after I said it first. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but a call with a friend of mine has made me think more. Honestly, this isn't new. I've felt a lot like I've been the only one putting any sort of effort into keeping up conversation or trying to keep things interesting and romantic, but it's difficult to keep that up when I get crumbs back most of the time. I also think the age and maturity gap between us has really showed itself. He seems so different to the attentive, open-minded guy I thought I knew. Now, he just feels like your run-of-the-mill emotionally closed off boy. I can hardly reconcile the two. \n\nI wonder, is this the person I want to spend my life with? I thought he was. I still like him so much, but if it keeps going in the direction it is, I don't think I want to stay with him. I mean, how does the romance fizzle out so early? I don't want things to be so boring when it's only been two months. It's just not sustainable. It's such a shame because in every other way, he's almost perfect. Maybe this just isn't the right time for us. He's in too uncertain of a position in his life. \n\nI know the right way to go is to communicate all of this with him, but I don't know how to do that without sounding like a dick. I mean, I'm not even his girlfriend yet. I'm not really looking for advice, but I just needed to vent all this.

This went on for about 5 years.\n\nI started to catch feelings, but still didn’t want a relationship, neither did he, but he also knew how I felt, and it seemed he felt the same way.\n\nThe problems started a little over a year in to our “relationship” where he would just randomly ghost, radio silence, and only to me. But he would show back up a week later like nothing happened. I would explain that it felt a little crappy that he would only stop talking to me. He would say he needed a break because he was overstimulated and that he was sorry he stopped talking to me, so we would just end up resuming any kind of flirting. He did this almost always around Christmas every year. Then in January I was talking to him about moving south and asking if he wanted to meet up, and see how things would go.. He told me we needed to “just stop” with the flirting and everything and just be normal friends. I told him I would try, but wasn’t sure what a normal friend to him would be, since our “relationship” was the way it was for YEARS.\n\nHe decided to ghost me again… Only this time, he didn’t decide to come back until mid July.. The first 3 months were full of me crying because I lost the one person who was there almost EVERY day and every night. After 3 months I started to accept he wasn’t coming back, or even going to bother trying to reconnect, so my feelings for him started to fade away.\n\nBut when he came back he tried resume any kind of “relationship” we had before… I told him it felt wrong and weird since I was so hurt by him leaving for so long without any word..\n\nSo I found a new guy, Boy 2(36M), who was giving me everything I wanted, which is just someone to enjoy the company of. We played games together, he calls me at night and we just talk, he makes me laugh uncontrollably hard, makes me smile so much my cheeks hurt, and calls me cute little names. But we also don’t want a real relationship because of the distance, but we have plans to meet in March of next year.\n\nBoy 1 found out about this and started making things weird, so weird boy 2 won’t join us in games anymore out of respect of not making boy 1 uncomfortable.\n\nBoy 1 decided to tell me that for the entire 5 years of our “relationship” he did in fact love me, and wants me to stop talking to boy 2, because he’s trying to become a better man so he can be with me properly… He is unemployed, technically. He’s a farmhand on his uncles farm. So he wants to move out and get financially stable before he allows himself to be with me. I never once told him he needed to change anything about himself, I always told him I liked him as he was and if he truly wanted to change things, I would be willing to help if given the chance. He asked me to wait for him, but hasn’t taken any steps to prove he’s really trying to change for me.. I told him I don’t want to wait, because the future isn’t guaranteed, and if he really wanted a relationship he would just take it now, and accept that I’m willing to either go there, or him come here. But he refuses until he’s “better”.\n\nI told him I won’t stop talking to boy 2 because we are not in a committed relationship, and boy 2 and I are friends who expect nothing from one another.\n\nNow boy 1 constantly makes me feel like I just ran over a puppy anytime I even mention boy 2.(I should note, I never tell him anything about boy 2, just casually mention that boy 2 said something funny, or that he could help in the video game we were playing.) He shuts down and starts making me feel bad for still talking to him while also talking to boy 1.. He tells me he feels like his time isn’t being valued when he declines hanging out with other people because I’m around, and always thinks of me when doing things.. I never guilt trip him to doing anything. I always tell him to go do other things, because I know it’s important to spend time with people.\n\nI told boy 1 that if he wasn’t so anxious about leaving the farm, I would 100% buy his plane ticket and have him come stay with me for a week, since I have my own home and can host a visitor. But he refuses profusely because I “shouldn’t be the one buying the plane ticket”\n\nI just need outside opinions on how to handle this.. It’s my first time dealing with this sort of situation, and I feel like a terrible person.", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

I (m21) and my girlfriend (f20) have been together for almost two years now. We recently started long distance about two months ago and things have been pretty smooth for the most part. This last week, though, was super tough for the both of us. I’m a volunteer firefighter who had a particularly bad call and had some strong emotions after it. In fact, I’m wondering if it’s still something I want to pursue. She’s a psych major and just finished up a summer camp for kids with autism, and it’s probably one of the hardest things she’s ever done. We barely spoke for most of the days she was there, but always made time to have a quick phone call. She’s barely had any alone time and is a person who needs it. On Tuesday, we got into our first fight over the phone which we smoothed over and, even talked about some new boundaries. I was really proud of us. Thursday, I felt like tensions were still high so we took the night to kind of focus on ourselves and it seemed to work fine, but the last two days then, we haven’t been able to talk at all. Today, was even harder. Her kids left and she spent most of the day cleaning and dealing with coworkers. I asked how she was and just responded that she’s doing ok. She ended up getting drunk with some girls and told me she was safe and having a good time, which is awesome, but then I stopped hearing from her. I assume she just fell asleep. I guess I’m just bummed cause I miss her and was looking forward to a conversation. It also would’ve been nice to know beforehand what her plans were so I wasn’t waiting for a call, but I know she didn’t mean anything by it. Do I sound dumb? How do we get back on track?

We haven’t spent time/spoken in a while, and he feels like i deserve more. He feels lonely because of the distance, and with everything happening feels like he needs less on his plate. We were seriously ending things, then called and ended up not breaking up. We don’t want to split but i want what’s best for him. Currently not able to see each other due to financial issues on both ends. Unsure what to do.\n\napologies for the essay, i tried to summarize it as much as i could\n\nWe met online through a video game (i had just turned 19, he was 18 for a few months, born in same year), and we never intended to have something online, but we truly fell for each other. We had our ups and downs, doubts here and there, but we have not once broken up. We’ve only taken one break for about 2-3 weeks(both tried to not text the other), but have stayed together because we want something serious.\n\nNow to the issue- we haven’t really spoken too much or really spent that much time together or even spoken much/called in a month- a month and a half, and i figured he wanted more space and just didn’t know it (thought this because that was the reasoning for the previous break, he was under a lot of stress). But he came to me saying that he thinks we should end things, he’s under a lot of pressure from family issues, financial issues, personal issues, and it hurts him that i can’t be there to comfort him. \n\nHe said he wishes i was there because he wants physical touch, and for someone to comfort him. That it hurts him because he misses me so much but he can’t even hold me (it’s been a problem in the past). And with everything going on with him he feels like he needs less off his plate, just so he doesn’t have to worry about it as much.\n\nHe feels as though he’s not good enough for me, as i value quality time, and there’s been a few times where i had gotten upset because we wouldn’t spend as much time together. He feels like he’s holding me back from finding someone better, but i always told him that despite everything he’s a good guy and genuinely treats me well, and a bunch of things i love about him that makes him better than others. Even during arguments he has never called me names or said terrible things.\n\nAs much as i hated the idea of losing him (we are really attached to each other) i chose to respect his decision and even though i wanted to beg him to stay, i decided not to. He told me this over text, and he sounded serious about it. He said even though we are broken up, we’ll still have each others phone numbers to text each other every now and then, because he can’t imagine just throwing me away and never talking to me again. So i asked him if we could call for the last time before we do.\n\nAt first he sounded sure about it all, but after everything he said he had a “wtf am i doing” moment, and realized he doesn’t want to lose me. He doesn’t want to end things, if anything take a break, but he still doesn’t want to do that. I’m still not 100% sure where he stands, we planned to talk about it later today too. At the end of the call it sounded like we weren’t splitting up, we went from crying to even laughing a little. Hearing my voice again apparently reminded him that what we have is real and genuine.\n\nThing is, i genuinely don’t want to lose him. I love him with all my heart. I can’t imagine my life without him because he’s such an important part of my day, even when we barely talk. But i thought about if he’s constantly worrying about me/us, it might not be the best thing for him. He says he genuinely loves me and i always will have a special place in his heart. And as much as it hurts me i want the best for him. Even when it sounded like we were done he truly wanted what was best for me, he wanted me to do things to help myself.\n\nCurrently because of everything we haven’t been able to see each other. We are both struggling financially and simply don’t have the money to see each other, although we really want to. I offered to contribute to his flight and hotel and maybe even pay for one or the both fully when im able to, but he doesn’t feel like i should be paying for everything, because he wants to be able to do things together and buy me stuff/spoil me (we “fight” about this lol, i want to spoil him too).\n\nI thought about a few options:\n-break up completely, which seems really scary and extreme\n\n-taking a break until one of us either can’t take it, or is ready to make a decision if we stay or separate \n\n-taking a break until his situation is better\n\n-slightly limit contact, maybe video call once 1-2 weeks to update each other, and so we can see each others faces/hear our voices more regularly and to remember what we have\n \n-keep somewhat our current situation and text when we feel like it, so we don’t feel alone\n\nwhat should we do? i’ve thought about bringing up option 4 to him, but i would like to hear other people’s opinions or other possible choices", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Need advice.\n\nHey everyone. So I (20M) met this girl (let’s call her Ara, 19F) while studying abroad in Spain. We clicked really fast, spent about a month together in person (end of May to end of June), and since coming back we’ve been talking for around 3 months straight. At first it was just as friends, but the vibe has definitely shifted into more-than-friends. We FaceTime almost every day, text constantly, and there’s been flirting, compliments, playfighting, her calling me pretty/handsome, and both of us admitting to jealousy stuff I would never normally do with just friends.\n\nHere’s where it gets complicated:\n- Her ex. She broke up with her boyfriend about a month ago (August). She says she doesn’t have feelings for him anymore, but she felt responsible for him because he leaned on her emotionally (he even said his life would fall apart without her). That made me uncomfortable, because it felt like emotional attachment, even if not romantic. Just recently (literally yesterday), she blocked him and cut off all contact because it was too much. She’s also told me she had been mentally checked out of the relationship for a while.\n- My own baggage. I also just got out of a situationship that messed me up. I’ve been processing it for months, and even though I don’t have romantic feelings for that girl anymore, I still sometimes grieve it when I see her around campus. So part of me wonders if I rushed into catching feelings for Ara because of how nice the attention felt.\n- We admitted feelings. We’ve straight up told each other that we like each other. We agreed we can’t keep acting like a couple because it doesn’t feel right right now, but we keep folding and crossing the boundaries we set.\n- The jealousy piece. I get jealous when she talks about other guys, and she gets jealous when I talk to other girls. We both admit it doesn’t feel right to be this jealous “as just friends,” but the feelings are real and hard to control.\n- The distance. We’re planning to see each other in December — that’s realistically the next time we could meet in person. Until then, it’s all long-distance, and honestly that scares me. I’ve seen people clown on long-distance and say it never works. I don’t want this to be just “in love with my phone.”\n\nSo now I feel torn.\n\nOn one hand, I really care about her and genuinely like her. On the other, the timing feels awful: neither of us has fully healed or had enough time to process from our past situations, and we live far apart. We both said we don’t want to hurt each other and that we want to keep the friendship no matter what, but at this point we’re way past normal friendship territory. I think part of this is us filling each other’s voids, but another part feels like genuine interest that just grew through the screen. \n\nWhat I’m struggling with:\n\n- How do I know if we like each other or if we’re just attached to the attention?\n- Should we keep texting/calling and try to maintain this spark until December, or is that just setting us up to get hurt?\n- Are we just filling voids while we’re both vulnerable?\n- Is it worth even trying long distance when people say it rarely works?\n\nI want to respect her, keep the friendship, and not lose her. But I also don’t want to get stuck in something unhealthy where we’re both confused and end up hurt.", "disorder_norm": [], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "JEALOUSY_INSECURITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

Everything seemed to be going really well. I was hesitant the first few weeks, but she was affectionate, we played video games together, really got to know her, visited her for 4 days, introduced me to her parents, had dinner with them, the trip itself was great. She expressed interest in continuing things, but since she’d never done long distance, she wanted to take it slow. I’d only done LDR once before, so I agreed.\n\nAfter I came back from the trip, she raised some concerns. She brought up an old TikTok comment I’d left on a friend’s post back in June (before we started talking; it was just a 🤗 emoji), and a more recent Instagram comment with the same friend (a “Lorax” quote, she was in a forest of some kind). I’d known this friend for 3 years we briefly flirted in college but it hasn’t been romantic since. I explained the context, unfollowed the friend, removed her as a follower, and tried to reassure her. She told me she appreciated the honesty, and admitted she’d naturally be upset, but I owned how it might have looked and thought we were good.\n\nA few days later, she went to a frat party (which I knew about). That night she didn’t check in, which made me anxious. The next day I brought it up calmly about my concerns, just trying to seek the same kind of reassurance she’d asked of me earlier. Initally, she said I had nothing to worry about, but later in the day she responded that she didn’t want to feel pressured or “have to check in all the time.” when she's out with friends, understandable I've had previous relationships like this. The very next day she ended things, saying the distance was too much and she needed to focus on school but said I was a great guy, treated her amazing, and made her feel \"seen\".\n\nI tried to fight for it, but she said she had too much going on. In my head, I can’t help but assume she ended it because of the situation with my friend, but I let it go. I know I was intentional, there was no malicious intent, and I wasn’t cheating on her.\n\nThat was less than two weeks ago.\n\nYesterday, she’s already publicly with a new guy ironically, a frat guy. Her friends are commenting “my favorite couple.”\n\nI’m hurt and confused by how fast she switched. Part of me wonders if I was a rebound, or if she really flipped her feelings for me that quickly over one interaction with a friend and got with a dude at the party. I saw long term potential, and now I just feel discarded.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? Was this a breakup or more like a discard?

I just need advice on how I should approach this topic without it sounding like I want to give up on us. \n\nFor context, my boyfriend and I have been together a year and a half. We were together in person for about 4 months in the same country while I started university and he had just finished his undergrad. After that it’s been long distance since then, as he left to pursue a postgrad in a different country and I continued mine. We’re not super far apart, we’re both within Europe so at most we have an hour and a half flight from each other. During uni time, we were visiting each other about once a month, at least for a week each time. But now I’ve been home for the summer which is all the way in the US so it’s quite impractical to visit since flights are really expensive and we both only have part-time money. \n\nI’m not sure if it’s because it’s been 3 months without seeing each other that’s making it feel worse or if this feeling is arising in general, but sometimes it’s hard for me to feel like continuing to do the distance is worth it. We have no concrete plan to move in together after we graduate (I plan to do my masters and he plans to do his PhD but we both don’t know where yet) and being from the US also makes things complicated too. We’ve only had a brief talk about this, but it still didn’t really reach anywhere. I don’t know what will happen when we both graduate since I finish my undergrad and he finishes his postgrad at the end of this year. I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle doing the distance indefinitely especially since I feel like I’m not even completely satisfied with how things are now. \n\nI’m afraid that this feeling of “missing out” on the aspects of an in-person relationship are creating problems since I feel like I get irritated at him when there’s not really any reason for me to be, or I get upset and just keep bringing up old issues that I feel like are happening but are just in my head because of this feeling. He tries to hear me out each time, but lately it feels like I’m getting upset at the wrong things when it’s really this sentiment that’s causing it. I don’t know how to bring it up to him without it sounding like I want to break up because I don’t, and we have a non refundable trip to see each other in a couple of weeks. I just don’t know what to do or how to deal with feeling this way because if it gets any worse then I’d hate for it to cause a rift between us.

After a lot of arguing and me not wanting to show SnapChat, because I was on my privacy protection high horse, we cleared it up. I had nothing to hide, I was just uncomfortable with the whole thing out of my habit. Then she caught me smoking and in panic I lied about it, cause I was ashamed.

About a month ago, I matched with a guy on Hinge (31M). Both of our profiles said we were looking for a long-term relationship. Our first convo got flirty, and I made it clear I wasn’t looking to mess around casually. He told me he understood and was genuinely into me. For our first date, he drove 1.5 hours to take me out to dinner. We had amazing chemistry, fun conversation, and we ended up hooking up. I hadn’t had sex in almost a year and I wanted to — no regrets. I am not someone who attaches after sex, and it was amazing. The next day he texted saying he had a great time, that I’m amazing and “was worth a 12 hr drive.”  We texted every single day, and he came back the next week. We had dinner, watched a movie, spent about 8 hours together. I made it very clear that I only am physical with people if I’m exclusive. He said I’d made that clear, that thinks I’m special, has never met anyone like me, and likes me. He also got weirdly jealous when I mentioned an ex, saying he didn’t want to hear about exes or people I’d slept with. We texted heavily every day, lots of flirting, things like “you’re worth waiting for” (we didn't see each other for a week), \"You’re hot and smart and sexy, “you’re too pretty to be sad.” We were joking, complimenting each other, and even talking about cuddling/spooning/sleeping next to each other. It felt like he was leaning into couple-y territory — saying he wanted to see me, that he liked me. At one point I told him I wasn’t used to having such an immediate attraction and didn’t usually come on so strong (as we both were), and he told me he loved it and wanted me to keep it up.\n\nWe planned to see each other Saturday, and I told him my Friday plans had fallen through so we could see each other both days. Out of nowhere, he texts me: “[my name], what do you think is the end goal with us?” I asked him to call, and on the phone he told me:\n\n• He’s had a hard time with relationships this past year.\n\n• He doesn’t feel like he wants to be in anything committed.\n\n• He likes me and thinks I’m amazing, but “pretty much knows” it won’t turn serious.\n\n• He didn’t want to hurt me if I wanted something serious. I told him that all I was asking for was spending time together and getting to know each other. I wasn’t asking for marriage or for him to be my boyfriend. He said that he “couldn’t say with 100% certainty that things wouldn’t go further.” I said flat out that I didn't want to be with someone who didn't want to be with me, and he got frustrated and said that's not what was happening.\n\nThis was confusing because his profile says “looking for long term.” From the beginning I was clear that I wasn’t looking to just mess around, and he said he understood and was into me. He told me he hasn’t been seeing or sleeping with anyone else, it’s just me.\n\nI told him my only goal right now was to keep spending time together and see where it goes, but it sounded like he was saying he knew he wasn’t that into me. He insisted that wasn’t the case. I asked if he was unsure about what would happen, or if he knew it wouldn’t be serious — he said he wasn’t sure. But he also wouldn’t make a clear decision either way. Finally I told him I wasn’t going to make the call for him, but that I don’t think he would’ve brought this up if he didn’t already know what he wanted. He agreed. So I said goodbye and hung-up.\n\nI don't know why people do this.

I'll try to be as concise as possible, but this spans quite a bit. Thanks to everyone that'll spend time reading and giving me an advice or a different point of view. I'll call the F32 Carla, a fictional name.\n\nThis will be a long post, i'm sorry for that.\n\nI switched job at the beginning of this year and started in a new place, where I met Carla that worked in a different department, but with plenty of chance to chat/meet.\n\nI was in a relationship at that time and wasn't looking for anything of the sort, so we just chatted sporadically at the coffe machine.\n\nDuring the months we grew closer and started talking a bit more frequently, even after work.\n\nWe grew closer and closer as friends.\n\nShe was also in a relationship at that time and we started helping each other by discussing our relationship's problems, she was in a toxic relationship where her boyfriend would frequently snap at her, disrespect her and making her feel guilty for the most various stuff.\n\nI wasn't feeling happy in my relationship since my girlfriend would prioritize her own goals and plans over me at any time.\n\nBy helping each other out we gradually grew even closer and realized that actually we started developing feeling for each other. This was late July.\n\nWe spoke about it (And did nothing else, there wasn't anything physical between us, but I admin that there was some emotional infidelity on both our ends at this point, which I'm not proud of) and decided that we'll both try to understand what to do with our lives in the next few weeks.\n\nThis until she decides to leave her boyfriend 1/2 days later and went back to her parents house.\n\nWe meet again to talk and she says that she'll not wait for me for a long time and gives me a deadline. I specified that if she wanted just to bother me with a fling or anything like that, I would have said goodbye to her to never talk to her again, I was there for a life-plan, not for some fun. She said she was of the same idea.\n\nAfter a week or so of thinking I decide to close my relationship, since the problems that Carla helped me realize were real.\n\nAfter this we start \"dating\" mostly in secret since she didn't want to tell her parents, fearing that they'll judge her.\n\nFast forward 3/4 weeks after we started this \"secret\" relationship she tells me that in this moment she can't think of starting anything else, that she first needs to be happy even alone.\n\nDuring all this time she started seeing a therapist and had quite a lot of problems with her ex boyfriend that did all he could to guilt-trip her and making her feel like she abandoned him.\n\nWhen she tells me that i obviously feel quite saddened, but since i'm a rational person I can't argue that it would be the best thing. A switch between two relationships isn't the the best outcome. So we agreed to stay as friends with no expectations.\n\nAt the start we continued to text each other every day, until she told me that she was feeling we were still too close, so we grew distant.\n\nAfter some other weeks (mind we work \"together\"), in which we texted more sporadically and I kept a polite collegue-friend attitude, she told me that she wanted to get closer again, since she was missing our friendship, to which I agreed, since I liked having her as a friend.\n\nN.B. At this time my expectation for a relationship with her were mostly non-existent.\n\nWe started texting again for a couple days when she came out with a \"I'm sorry, but whenever we talk as friends i feel guilty to my ex-bf because of when we talked before i left him, I feel horrible having done something like this to him. I don't feel we can be friends anymore\".\n\nAnd this time i was quite confused, but hey ok no problem, go your way then but don't think i'll be happy!\n\nShe sends me a text the following day:\n\n\"I'm sorry for the things I said yesterday, perhaps they weren't very nice to hear. I'm also sorry for ruining our friendship. I wish you all the best, truly.\"\n\n\"The fact is that I don't regret anything that happened. I had entered a dark tunnel and saw everything negatively. I was judging myself first and foremost.\n\nI hope you will be able to harbor less resentment towards me over time. The friendship that initially bound us together was special to me. Have a good Saturday.\"\n\nI told her that i wasn't harboring any resentment, just a little bit of disappointment to which she started defending herself saying that she was sorry that she didn't meet my expectations of her.\n\nI concluded by telling her all the thing that happened (in the same way i wrote here) and that I was always coherent with what I said. She told me that she was trying to do her best to not hurt anyone and sort her chaos out. I told her that this time I couldn't really help her and she said that she wouldn't have asked me since it wasn't my duty to help her in that case.\n\nAfter 10 days or so, where we were distant, but still polite/friendly and she went on her pto, it was her birthday and i texted her happy birthday and that I truly wished she was happy since she told me that she usually hated her birthday (Something about getting old, she was quite stressed about getting old, having white hair or anything like that).\n\nShe answered that she was truly grateful and that she truly missed our friendship.\n\nAnother 5/6 days after this i text her to ask her if she had some time to catch up since i got her a little present for her birthday (nothing too crazy, truly). She was grateful and told me that she would like to postpone to the next week since that week she had to deal with some stuff. I told her that if she wasn't confortable in meeting me that would have been totally fine and with no hard feelings at all.\n\nThen i had my PTO and she didn't text me, which I was prepared to, so actually not a big deal.\n\nLast fast-forward to last thursday, when i came back from my PTO. I was friendly/polite as usual and I didn't mention the birthday at all, since I understood that would have made her unconfortable.

I saw him yesterday and kind of asked like how he’s feeling, as we’ve seen each other 12 times and it’s been going great, he is even going out with me and my friends on Saturday-which he is really excited about, and I have also met his friends. The time we have spent together is really great. \n\nAnyway, I brought up how I’m not really on dating apps and he said that isn’t either and not planning on it, but he’s just not ready for a label-which I totally get because we have only known each other a month. He said he is nervous of commitment because he’s jumped into relationships that weren’t right for him before. He is a great guy, consistent with actions and communications, and we are both not really dating around rn. Last night we started having sex after a REALLY passionate makeout session but then I panicked because I started overthinking. He was so respectful about it and said “let’s not have sex until we have a label, I fucking love a lot of things about you and how things r going, but I don’t want this to feel more like a casual thing to either one of us or rush something good” (along those lines)\n\nWhen he got home he texted me “thanks for another great night! Sorry about what happened, I think we should remove that side of dating out and truly get to know each other in a proper manner. Ik I was the one who started it and I apologize.” AGAIN-so many green flags: very respectful to my parents, good communicator, takes me out, it is not all sexual AT ALL - we just love each others company, share so many laughs, and both have similar personalities.\n\nMy question is: is this a good sign that he wants to take things slow in regards to intimacy and build a stronger connection?

We really hit it off and had fun together even if it was only a day spent together. We agreed we really liked each other and we kissed before I left. It’s a relief to know that I can still find love being more mature now. \n\nWhat makes it long distance is that I’m from around the Houston area living with my mom and she lives all the way in the DFW area in her own apartment. She’s from around Austin originally, she moved there to pursue cooking school, but since she got kicked out, she’s been looking for a job to still sustain and save up for her dream. She’s an amazing cook and a very artistic person. She loves the same music I do, and hasn’t been through anything I would call life changing traumatic. (ie rape, abuse in any shape or form, kicked a serious addiction, etc) To keep things romantic. We’ve been sending each other letters and we’ve even been texting and calling each other when we can. We’ve both agreed we are happy that we both came into each others lives since we see eye to eye so well and that we love each other for who we are. We wanna keep this going since we make each other happy, but we both also respect that we got our lives to start. \n\nWe’ve been talking for going on 4 months now.

I’m still getting used to highways and driving in general. (I’ve only been on the road for about a year) It’s been about close to 2 months since we’ve seen each other and she told me not to get into a rush to see me again. Go at my own pace and then try to make moves when you can. She’s even offered to meet in the middle, but I wanna get to were we spend multiple days together. I feel like I can make the trip eventually, I mean I drove in the mountains of Colorado for a few weeks and I feel like I can managed rough terrain and various roads good enough.

Does anyone have some calming advice to give? Maybe some tips to make it seem like not that big of an issue. Or maybe guidance on new techniques to try to maybe spice things up. Also short question, should I get a job before I see her next? I was thinking of applying for grad school since I just graduated. Plus I’m applying to schools that around like an hour closer to like 30 minutes closer to her since they are the best in what I wanna be.

So we would frequently get into arguments and whatever basically i get frustrated alot because i never meet her.\n\nSo last week i told her that ill be taking a break from social media and ill be focusing on my exams since its in january and told her she can move on with her life.\n\nBUT......\na friend came to text me and told me that she has been close to another dude for quite a while and that broke me so this week i confronted her about all this shit and the reason she gave me was that\n\n \"SINCE YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT HAVING DATED B HENCE I ALSO THOUGHT IT'LL BE BETTER FOR ME TO BE CLOSE TO THIS NEW DUDE \" \n\nAnd mind you guys i came back to text her after 3 days , and 3 days was all that she took to move on to this other dude , after that i confessed the entire lie and i even told her that i lied because\n\n1.

Since my ex lied too so even i decided to do the same\n3. I felt the past should do nothing with our ties because i loved her dearly and didn't treat her wrong even if i lied about my past.\n\nSo i just blocked her that day because i was soo hurt considering that she took only a handful of days to get with someone new that just shows her desperation,  ungratefulness , in genuineness and lack of empathy. \n\nLike i said we were almost at the point of dating each other so here's the question to yall\n\nIs it valid for her to judge me by my past even if i had lied?\nIs it valid for her to say that i treated her like an option?\nIs it valid for her to cry for months and not tell me about until the end just because of a lie about my past?\n\n\nAnd lastly \n\nIs it someone i should regret losing?\n\nIm really in a bad state because i experience intense loneliness at home and the thought of her enjoying with someone new hurts me , when i tell her about the things ive done for her she just picks up random small events where i ignored her and all , in which i wasnt even on my mind nor even seen her .

I’ve communicated that I need more from him in ways such as having more phone calls besides just a quick morning check in and goodnight. And when he’s home I’ve asked that he puts effort into making sure we spend enough quality time together so I don’t feel unsatisfied with our relationship.\n\nHe said that he doesn’t want to talk on the phone that much when he’s working because he doesn’t have any time to, but also he tells me about the Netflix shows he’s watching and I know he has some time to talk.\n\nIt’s like he just doesn’t even like me so I don’t understand. And then when he’s home, we had been living together sort of on accident but it’s like he thinks sitting in the house is sufficient to keep a relationship exciting. I’ve asked for one day a week when he’s home where I don’t have to beg him to spend time together and we actually do something besides going to get food. He has agreed in the past but then never takes initiative to do it which makes me feel like he doesn’t care. At this point it’s like why are we even in a relationship.\n\nNot to mention our sex life vanished for like 5 months and then it came back but it’s nothing amazing. He also won’t kiss me anymore besides pecks. I try to kiss him longer and he pulls away. He has stopped giving me oral also but always wants me to give it to him.\n\nI just don’t understand what he wants out of this because it’s not like we have amazing sex all the time and he’s just spending his money on buying my food when we go out to eat.\n\nI still feel in love with him which is why I haven’t cut things off. He makes a lot of empty promises that make me feel like things will change. Like he just got a new apartment of his own and says now that he’s done that then he will make more effort but low and behold he has another thing he now must do before he can put the work in. It just never ends.\n\nYesterday he called me after being gone a week and said I can come over “if I want to” and I just lost it I’m like how can you not care to see me, this hurts because I miss you and I’ve been so anxious about our relationship and blah blah so I asked him again one more time to do the things I need him to do or I’m done and I think he knows I was serious this time because he wouldn’t say yes and just kept reverting to how I should be understanding  of everything going on with his life as a busy young man and I just said I do understand but you also need to understand where I’m coming from. So basically I think we are gonna break up because I said I’m not gonna wait around for his effort anymore. And it’s not like I’m leaving anything anyways. But I don’t want to. I really want to stay together but the pain this is causing me is unbearable now.\n\nSo did I make the right decision? Or does anyone have any suggestions to help us work through this? Although it feels unlikely.\n\nTL;DR: Been with my bf (26M) for almost 2 years. He works away half the year and puts little effort into calls, dates, or intimacy when he’s home. I’ve asked for more quality time and affection, but he makes empty promises and never follows through. Our sex life has suffered, and I feel neglected and unloved. I told him I’m done unless he steps up, but he keeps saying I should just “understand he’s busy.” I love him, but the relationship is painful and feels one-sided. Did I make the right call ending it, or is there a way to fix this?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["LACK_COMMUNICATION", "REUNION_SEPARATION_STRESS", "SILENCE_GAP", "TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "SEPARATION"}

Career or love?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am feeling a bit down and confused right now and I would really appreciate some advice.\n\nI am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend. We met while I was working in Asia after undergrad. Later on, I decided to pursue a master’s degree in Canada with the hope of building a career and possibly settling here. He knew about my plan from the beginning, and we still decided to stay together.\n\nNow I am about to graduate, and I am at a crossroads. Part of me wants to stay in Canada and gain two to three years of international work experience. That has always been part of my career plan, and my parents and close friends all encourage me to stay. They say once I leave, it will be hard to come back as an international student.\n\nAt the same time, I love my boyfriend deeply, and he loves me too. We care about each other so much and really want a future together. I want to end the long distance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, his job is not a good fit for the Canadian market, so if we want to be in the same city, I would likely be the one who has to make the move.\n\nMy long term plan is to return to Asia in about five years, but doing long distance for more than three years sounds incredibly hard. I am trying to be realistic about how much emotional strain it can bring, even though we are both committed to making it work.\n\nI feel torn. I want to grow professionally and stay on my current path, but I also do not want to risk losing this relationship. The hardest part is that I can only focus my job search in one place. I feel stuck and unsure of what I really want right now.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? How did you decide between building your career and being with the person you love?

M22/F21\n\nMe and my girlfriend have been together for 9 months now, so I’m still pretty new to long distance.

We had never met irl. I'll spare the details but we've had an amazing relationship and were extremely lovey dovey from start until june where a few turn of events almost tore us appart and we've been trying to hold it together, here's what's going on\n\nOn her side, something I've known prior to the relationship is that she has a genetic disorder that greatly affects her immune system. She has been diagnosed hypersomniac a week ago. Both these factors make her unable to work and it is a big weight on her, and it forces her to live with her mom. Back in june she took custody of her little sister, they do not share the same mother but she now also lives at my gf's mom. And towards the start of august one of her best friend passed away, she does not have much time to herself to properly mourn her. This is a lot for her to take as it has been for me because it prevents us from meeting like we thought at the start of the relationship. I wish she would express more how she is doing but most of the time she just holds it in and explodes when I make the wrong step.\n\nMeanwhile me I have a FT job so during the day it's very difficult to keep contact, I try very hard with messages but she has not been receptive to those and prefer voice which I can't access unless I have a break. That sounds alright on paper, but it really weights me that the communication during the day is so difficult and how little time we have during the evening to connect which also have obstacles which are mostly she taking care of her sister, and activities that include me, myself and some friends (I don't feel connected to my partner when there's too many people around). Also, despite my choice to pursue this carrier I don't see myself growing in my field, I want to change but I'm very hesitant to take the first step because I have no idea what to do. I could say more if I think about it but to sum it up : I'm being very pessimistic about anything. To top it all of I would say I'm socially awkward and I struggle to have confrontation, I usually will take personnaly any reproach and it will get stuck to me for way too much time and yk when I feel like I take the right step, suddenly I'll fuck up and go back 100 step. I might be selfish in a sense but after a 9h workday it's been hard to keep up. I could make an expose of what I think about myself and it would be veryy negative. I tried therapy but I don't think I engaged in the right topics and would go again.\n\n  \nI really really really don't want to end this relationship, she has been a shining light when I was alone and has helped me going through life. I want to better myself for her and for me, but I'm struggling. Any advice could help and I'm free to discuss.

There’s been fights, tears, laughs and what not. By July 13th, he came to my country for a visit and he’s gonna stay until October 4th. This is our second meeting. The first meeting, I came to his country over the holidays. What was going to be the best summer ever turned out to be the hardest summer ever. Here’s why… \n\nEver since he came to my country, he’s been nothing but argumentative, negative and have attitude like he owns the place. We’re staying at my place and I made everything ready for his arrival. I cleaned my apartment, washed my sheets, everything. The apartment was spotless. \n\nARGUMENTS: \n•Because I’m living on my own with my dog, he’s been offering to help out with stuff around my place, for example walk my dog, do the dishes with me, laundry, etc. but he hasn’t been living up to that. I get it, he’s in a new place and has to settle down but I mentioned it for him as soon as yesterday. His response: “maybe you could pay me something for it. Like a chore! I do stuff and you pay me for it” \n\n•He becomes upset every time he asks how I’m doing and I tell him I’m doing good and nothing’s wrong. I’m telling him the truth, yet he still accuses me of lying \n\n•Whenever I keep “lying”, he becomes more mad and leaves my place without telling me where he’s going. I know that he’s going outside to take a breather but he doesn’t have any data on his phone so I can’t keep contact with him. Then when he does come back, he gets mad that I didn’t come looking for him. But in my defense, it is pretty hard to find him when I’ve been searching the area and there’s no trace of him. As far as just 3 days ago, I was wandering around, looking for him for over an hour\n\n•The arguments turn into a fight. Literally… \nHe’s begun to (in his words) become comfortable, which of course would sound nice out of context but it’s not that case on my body. No, he hasn’t raped me or anything of that nature but he has begun to become more outgoing, meaning that he’s held me tight in my arms twice. The second time, he did it so hard that I couldn’t feel my hands and bruises were left on my arms\n\nWHAT DO I DO?: \nMy family absolutely loves him. I haven’t told them about what’s going on. I’ve never really talked to my family about personal problems before so I wouldn’t know how to start or where to begin. \nHe’s low on money to buy a ticket to go back home again, and he’s saying it to me like it’s my responsibility that he has enough money. \nHe was on a FaceTime call with his parents last night, he told them both with a smile and pride in his voice that “everything is going peachy here”.

He’s the love of my life, my best friend, and I have no doubts that I want to spend the rest of my life with him. \n\nOk, I should say /almost/ no doubts. There’s a few alarms going off for me as we prepare to buy a house together later this year.\n\nLately, when we’ve been searching for potential houses, he’ll subtly try to rule out certain locations (even ones that are in affordable, safe cities with great communities) because he’s worried the places we’re looking at are “too far away from his parents.” While I’d understand this argument if we were looking, say, out of state, he’s raised this concern about places that are within 30-45 minutes of his parents’ house. Any time I’ve discussed a location beyond that threshold, he mentions that it’d be difficult logistically to move us /and/ his parents to that city. He states this as though it’s a given they’d have to move if we were more than an hour away. He’s also taking more and more of their advice regarding our future home, at times considering their suggestions more than my own.

One of the “features” they’ve brought up multiple times is a guest room with a big closet for when they “pop in and visit” (as I said, we are talking about homes that are less than an hours drive away from them). My fiancé and I have discussed, albeit briefly and a while ago, that I would not be comfortable with extended family moving into our future home with us. We are wanting to eventually start our own family, and I very much want that experience to be between just the two of us and not with “granny and pops” living under the same roof. While his parents have never been manipulative or purposely intrusive (they’re incredibly kind people), they have very poor understandings of personal boundaries that have caused some issues in the past. I’m talking, entering-our-apartment-unannounced-using-our-spare-key-and-walking-into-our-closed-bedroom-during-spicy-time-because-they-were-already-in-the-area-and-wanted-to-see-us types of poor boundaries. While my fiancé has always had long and serious conversations with them regarding these incidents and why they’re unacceptable, I’m getting more and more worried that he’s not being fully honest with me about his and his parent’s future intentions, and that he’s hoping I’ll be fine with them eventually living with us.\n\nI’m prone to overthinking things, which makes me hesitant to confront him regarding this situation as it could all be in my head and I don’t want to make him feel like I hate his family (I don’t) or don’t trust him. It just feels like lately he’s been showing some concerning signs that he plans on his parents having more of a presence in his and my future as a married couple than he’s willing to own up to. \n\nHow do I bring up this conversation without making him feel like I’m accusing him or trying to start a fight over what could very easily a nonexistent problem? I’m terrible with confrontation after dealing with a long history of verbal abuse, but I know the longer I sit on this the more I’m going to spiral. \n\nTL;DR: how do I talk to my fiancé about my fear of his parents being made the priority over me in our relationship without making him feel like I’m attacking him for his close relationship with them?", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD"], "triggers_norm": ["COMMITMENT_AMBIGUITY", "LACK_COMMUNICATION"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}

I’m staying at home and she is going to another city but I’ll still be able to visit her somewhat often.\n\nOur relationship has been really strong always and I love her more than life. She’s everything to me but I’ve always been paranoid about losing her. Because of that I’ve always tried to keep my worried and anxiety to myself knowing it was irrational. I have often feared she was cheating or going to breakup with me even when I knew it wasn’t true.\n\nThis last year my gf was really struggling mentally and so like always I’ve taken the brunt of being there for her emotionally. It started to take a toll on me during the summer and my anxiety has been getting really bad. As the summer went on my girlfriend formed a really close friend group and has been doing wayyyy better.\n\nShe spends time with a guy I’ll call Dan. She met dan on a trip and they got really close fast. They have almost everything in common from music to hobbies. They even started working together. The past month or so they’ve started spending almost everyday together. They work together during the day and after work she drives him around for hours before hanging out at his house. Occasionally I’ll ask and she’ll invite me or bring him to my place. Over the summer she’s also spent less and less time with me especially one on one.\n\nTo clarify she is not cheating on me I am sure of that (at least not physically) because Dan also has a gf who is in our friend group (and ofc I do trust my gf) but it does affect me knowing that Dan is into everything my gf likes and is also exactly her type.\n\nOver the past year my gf also developed a hate for phones due to her mental health issues and during the summer she’s been barely using her phone which I think is why her mood has improved. While I’m really happy for her I also lost that last bit of connection as now the only time we talk is when we are in a big group or for a few hours before bed when she sleeps over (which happens maybe 5-10 times a month).\n\nI want to bring this and other concerns and worries I have up to my gf. Not because I think any of my concerns are valid but because I think my behavior has started to affect her and our friends.

{"id": "u/That_2nf_account_1385", "user": "u/That_2nf_account", "text": "My (27f) boyfriend (35m) changed his mind about our marriage timeline without telling me.\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend decided he wants to wait longer to get married but didn’t tell me and I’m not sure where to go from here or if I am overreacting \n\nSo we have been dating for nearly 2 years and marriage has been a conversation pretty much from the beginning, especially since he is on the older end. For several months the plan was marriage summer of 2026 and that a proposal would be sometime between this summer and now (just not in the week leading up to my sister’s wedding which took place last week lol). I have told several people about this rough timeline, including people asking me at my sister’s wedding, which he did attend and was present for many of these conversations, including one on the phone with my mom while we were driving home from the wedding, with it being a 12 hour driving trip.\n\nWell we haven’t even looked at rings. We’ve talked about it and I have hinted occasionally when we have walked by a jewelry store, which happened yesterday. It made me worried so that evening when we got back to his place (we do not live together and do not intend to until marriage/right before for religious reasons but I do stay there on weekends because it is a bit of a drive) I asked him what was going on.\n\nFirst he said it was because over the summer he started looking into rings when I was out of town but got overwhelmed but then I said that doesn’t make sense and that’s why you go to a ring store together so you can work with a pro for help and get an idea of what I like. So after that and then asking if anything else was going on, he finally admitted he wants to push things back another year.\n\nThe reasoning he gave is because he has a cousin getting married next June and another in September and he’s worried about another wedding in the mix being too much for those family members. My stance is this is a huge life event and that there will always be other things going on and reasons to delay. It’s also not stuff with his actual immediate family and there seems to be plenty of room between these weddings anyway, but wanting to move the timeline isn’t even the biggest issue for me here. This is:\n\nI asked him how long he’s thought this, apparently he started having doubts over the summer and then really felt hit with it mid august when he was at a wedding (I did not attend due to work and travel expenses) and family was asking him questions and one person made a comment about how it would be hard for her to attend everything financially, that we haven’t been dating long enough, and that we should live together first. I personally feel she was a little out of line as he didn’t ask for this advice. \n\nHe ended up telling his mom he wanted us to now wait until next summer. But did not tell me until I forced it out of him last night. At first he said it’s because he didn’t have a chance to tell me but that’s not true. There was a whole weekend before I left for my sister’s wedding to tell me (I understand not saying anything the week of), and the 12 hour car ride back and even the times we hung out before the conversation.\n\nInstead he let me just go around telling all of these people this timeline he had no intention of following and now I’m embarrassed and upset we aren’t on the same page and I love his mom but it’s also something I feel he should have brought to my attention first or at least the next time we saw each other after we got back from my sister’s wedding. And if I hadn’t asked, who knows how long this would’ve gone on? And that’s what really scares me. He had an issue, and chose not to communicate it with me. He hates conflict, but he chose avoiding conflict over my feelings and over figuring out something I’d say is pretty important. And if he won’t tell me this is an issue, then what else might be a problem and he’s just not telling me? Or what else might I think we are on the same page with and actually are not?\n\nWe talked and talked but nothing is resolved. I stayed calm and voiced my feelings, both about not being told, and the timeline change in general but I have no idea if he has changed his mind or not and nothing instilled any sort of confidence that if there’s any sort of future problem in our relationship that he’ll come to me about it and I won’t have to force it out of him.\n\nI love him and think we could have a great life together but this is really worrying me. So what should I do next? Just next time we’re together, come up with another timeline and hope for the best? If he really feels like next summer is too much, why not push back just 6 months instead of a year?

We started dating knowing we’d be long distance, and it was our hope that in a year we’d be closer. Anddd that didn’t end up working out.

I don’t want to hash every nitty gritty detail, the long story short is us being closer together (physically in the same city) is now solely dependent on me it feels. To top it off, it’s in a city I’ve expressed … not wanting to live in. And I resent that. It makes me feel like I have to follow her and now shape my life to fit hers… and not shape my life for me… \nIt’s really taking a toll on me. Has anyone ever been in this boat?

He’s sweet, funny, kind, gorgeous and I feel so incredibly lucky to know him, let alone call him my boyfriend. We’ve been together for 3 months, so not long, and he’s had plans to travel for the last year, before we met. He’s travelling through Europe, then through South-East Asia, then settling in Japan where he’ll be going to language school in Tokyo for around a year. I’m already dreading it and this is going to be so incredibly hard, but he’s so wonderful and worth it, I’m gonna give it all I have.\n\nHe’s leaving a week today, and I feel sick with anxiety, thankfully, I’ve made plans to travel up to Greece and I’ll be staying with him for a week there, so there’s that, but that will be the last time I see him in months. I have some things planned out, but I’d love some tips to make this less difficult, he’s incredible and I want to stay with him whatever it takes.\n\nHere’s what I have so far:\n\n- I’m going to fly to Japan in either April next year or during the summer, hopefully April due to typhoon season, and I want to see him as soon as possible. I can’t do much more than that, I’m starting Uni in September, so we would have been moving apart regardless, but due to limited budget and term times, I’m quite restricted. I’m hoping I’ll be able to fly and meet him again afterwards, but I haven’t planned that far ahead (we’re from the UK).\n\n-Watching the same shows. Due to time zone differences, we probably wont be able to watch much stuff together, but we’re planning to watch some of the same shows so we can talk about them.\n\n- Text and call as much as we can (of course). I want to plan surprise online dates for him too, but I’m not sure what they should include (any ideas are so appreciated!!)\n\n- Possibly playing some games together as we both enjoy gaming. I’m a big Stardew Valley fan, and I think it would be really cute to have a shared farm on co-op and play together if he’s up for it!!!! There’s also Minecraft, and a game I’ve herd of called It Takes Two which looks fun and sweet.\n\n- I’d like to do dinner dates, but with the time zone difference (8 hours T_T), I’m not sure how that will work\n\n- Sending him gifts, ordering him food on busy days, sending him letters, etc.\n\n\nIf anybody has any tips at all, they’ll be so so appreciated!!

she doesn’t even know me. so i screenshot and sent it to my bf and he got soooo mad and he was like she’s crazy she’s had a crush on me for years blah blah blah just ignore her. okay… so i did, this ain’t my business and i don’t like drama, i thought it was just as he said, she was some crazy girl who was still obsessed with him 🤷‍♀️\n\nbut i went on holiday with my family, and for some reason it was bugging me so much, i had so many questions in my head like firstly why would she go as far as requesting to follow me and why would he react that strongly. something just didn’t sit right with me and i had a gut feeling that there was more to this story. so i accepted her follow request a few days later and requested to follow her back and she messaged me a couple days later saying that she can help me. like girl excuse me? i was confused so i was like um do i know you? and y’all she told me she was my boyfriend’s girlfriend. my jaw was on the floor and i was honestly just flabbergasted. like what the hell am i reading. it was bombshell after bombshell, y’all remember that ring i was talking about, yeah apparently she got it for him and they promised MARRIAGE to eachother, and according to her it had her name on it and she sent me a pic of the ring he gave her that mind you she was still wearing. y’all i was just *insert pikachu face meme* \n\nanyways after that shockwave passed she told me the story of their love/relationship whatever and how they were together for 7 years since 2018, 7 goddamn years! so imagine my shock. i was also confused as hell because he spent almost everyday for a whole year sleeping on call with me, FaceTiming me at random times any time we both could tbh, we were texting 24/7 like we always found time for eachother but apparently their relationship was on “hold” while he got his life together so that would explain why he had so much time for me. she then said they were not together until further notice so that he could get out of their country to have a better life and then bring her over and marry her and so there were a few cracks in her argument which although sounded unbelievably believable, i found it hard to believe because (1) of how real our relationship is (2) there was no timestamps on any of the “evidence” she showed me and (3) she claimed she new about me a year ago, i wouldn’t just idly stand by and watch my man get into a WHOLE ASS relationship with another girl like what??!! be so fr! she claims she “let him” because he kept reassuring her that it was only for “papers” to come over here to my country to live and work etc and that he doesn’t actually love me… guys honestly im just so speechless reliving this, i was speechless then and im speechless now! she told me she’s so in love with him she’s willing to forgive him for all of this because APPARENTLY he kept telling her to patient and to not be jealous and that it’s all gonna be worth it and all this shit like am i in a high school drama or smth 😭😭😭 \n\ny’all im trying my best to be coherent and not miss anything out but its hard like every time i try to keep my cool, i remember all of this and i get so shocked and angry like how can anyone keep their cool in a situation like this, i planned a trip to meet him (it’s easier for me to visit him than vice versa) in december and this just made me pause in my tracks \n\nokay lemme just finish this story before i lose my mind, she asked me not to tell him anything, i said alright, (just until i got all the “facts” lol so i could talk to him about EVERYTHING) i was fuming, and she asked me about our relationship, i sent her a screenshot of our most recent conversation to SHOW HER that we are very much in love and we had JUST spoken to eachother before he left for work. like damn she had me really contemplating if any of this shit is even real like dude.. NOBODY can fake being in love for that long!! or can they? i dont fucking know so she dropped another bomb that she had his instagram and facebook accounts so she saw allll of our messages/reels etc (😋 how fun) so she was basically stalking us and our chats and i was creeped tf out so that was really the cherry on top for me and to her it “proved” that they were still together because she STILL had his accounts yaay :) (can you tell im trying not to crash out)  \nand amazingly after telling ME not to tell him, she had the audacity to send him a screenshot of MY CONVERSATION WITH HIM (the one i sent her) and it all went to shit \n\nhe started blowing up my phone, she also blew up my phone, i felt so overwhelmed and im ngl even 2 whole days later when it all died down i feel so overwhelmed it’s unreal. he told me that she’s lying and that everything she’s saying is a lie and i so desperately want to believe him but some of the things she said really really got to my head. he said they broke up 2 years ago and he told her to leave him tf alone when she threatened to talk to me after she found out about me, he said he changed the passwords to his accounts so he doesn’t know how she still had them, and the ring? he threw it out and took a video to prove it to me \n\nso im just lost y’all i wont even lie, im hurt, confused, torn and to make things worse i even felt bad for her even tho she didnt have to do all this, i confronted her and told her that he said they broke up 2 years ago but she said they broke up last year… so this shit isn’t adding up for me and im just confused, ill never fully know the truth and ive accepted it, but im just idk, i love him but deep down i know im gonna struggle so bad to move past this even if i seem totally fine on the outside. i really question his decision making skills because the reason he didn’t tell me the truth about her was because he was scared i was gonna leave him \n\nsorry this is such a long post guys, if you got this far i just want to say thank you so so much from the bottom of my heard for reading, and i just wanna know what you guys would do in my position? i really need help and idk where else to look", "disorder_norm": ["ADJ", "GAD", "MDD", "SAD"], "triggers_norm": ["TRUST_FIDELITY"], "phase_norm": "ANTICIPATION"}
